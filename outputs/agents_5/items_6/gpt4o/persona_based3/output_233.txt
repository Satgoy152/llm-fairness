Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  87  23  83  79  41
1   6  50  70  26  70   0
2  12  71  71  96  23  76
3  30  19  75  10  75  22
4  63  86  17  23  66   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 6 items to the 5 agents in such a way that the allocation is fair and minimizes envy among the agents. One of the methods to achieve this is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or using the envy-freeness criterion.

Given the valuations, we'll attempt to allocate the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly, so we assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 2 values item 3 highly, so we assign item 3 to agent 2.
3. Agent 4 values item 0 highly, so we assign item 0 to agent 4.
4. Agent 1 values item 2 highly, so we assign item 2 to agent 1.
5. Agent 3 values item 4 highly, so we assign item 4 to agent 3.
6. The remaining item is 5, which we'll assign to the agent who has the next highest valuation and doesn't already have their most preferred item. Agent 2 values item 5 second highest, so we assign item 5 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation respects the preferences to the extent possible given the constraint of fairness.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```
