Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35   6  35  19  22  97
1   9  55  89  25  36  85
2  77  50  95  20  49  58
3  79  68  84  14  58  97
4  19  12  84  12   9  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent feels that they have received at least as much value as any other agent from their perspective. Given the constraints, we will allocate the items based on the agents' valuations to ensure a fair distribution of total value.

Below are the allocations based on maximizing each agent's total perceived value while ensuring envy-freeness to the greatest extent possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 5 (97) and 0 (35). Allocating items 5, 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 2 (89). Allocating item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 2 (95), but it is already taken. Next highest value item is 0 (77). Allocating item 0 would create envy, so allocate item 1 (50).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value items are 5 (97) and 0 (79), but both are taken. Next highest available value item is 3 (14). Allocating item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value items are 2 (84) and 5 (49), but both are taken. Next highest available value item is 4 (9). Allocating item 4.

Following these allocations, we ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and at least 6 items are allocated in total.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences to the extent possible while maintaining the constraint of integer allocations and allocating all items.
