Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  37   8   3  23  76
1  38  75  98  46  58  91
2  26  87   3  51  14  76
3  59  36  25  81  84  97
4  22  28  20  43  70   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the problem of fairly allocating the items among the agents, we need to consider a method that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. One commonly used method in fair division is the "Envy-Free" allocation, which tries to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations, let's analyze the scenario and propose an allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 highly (76) and item 1 (37) moderately.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 2 (98) and also values item 5 (91).
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 highly (87) and item 5 (76).
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest (97) and item 4 the second highest (84).
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the highest (70) and item 3 moderately (43).

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as they value it significantly higher than others.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as they value it the highest overall.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, where their valuation is the highest.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4, since they have a relatively higher valuation for it compared to others.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it remains available and Agent 0 values it moderately.

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items while keeping the distribution fair.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
