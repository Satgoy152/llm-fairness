Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  61   9  22  16   5
1  47   4  74  21  54  95
2  55  44  57   0  62  64
3  75  32  53  30  50  52
4  82  95  77  52  23   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents in a way that is as fair as possible. One common criterion for fairness is envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. However, given the discrete nature of this problem and the fact that envy-freeness may not be fully achievable, we aim to minimize envy and maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

We will first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items and then proceed by attempting to allocate the items to balance these values across agents as much as possible.

Here are the steps:

1. **Calculate total values for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: \(79 + 61 + 9 + 22 + 16 + 5 = 192\)
   - Agent 1: \(47 + 4 + 74 + 21 + 54 + 95 = 295\)
   - Agent 2: \(55 + 44 + 57 + 0 + 62 + 64 = 282\)
   - Agent 3: \(75 + 32 + 53 + 30 + 50 + 52 = 292\)
   - Agent 4: \(82 + 95 + 77 + 52 + 23 + 0 = 329\)

2. **Allocate items by maximizing each agent's satisfaction:**

   We will allocate items one by one, ensuring that we try to balance the total value of items received by each agent.

   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (62 is highest value for agent 2, and it balances their value closer to others).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (95 is highest for agent 1, and it adds significant value).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4 (52 is highest non-allocated value for agent 4, balancing the distribution).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (79 is highest value for agent 0, and provides a good start).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 (53 is highest non-allocated value for agent 3).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4 (95 provides balance and is highest remaining value).

3. **Resulting allocation:**

   After these allocations, the distribution is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

Each item has been allocated, and every agent has received at least one item. This allocation balances the total satisfaction based on the given valuations as evenly as possible, within the constraints of the problem.
