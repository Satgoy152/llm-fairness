Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  63  91  51   9  53
1  80  35  46  96  81  33
2  25  15  41  98  37  34
3  86  50  21  32  56  80
4  86  28  93  25  69  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel that they received a fair share of the items compared to others.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: \(29 + 63 + 91 + 51 + 9 + 53 = 296\)
   - Agent 1: \(80 + 35 + 46 + 96 + 81 + 33 = 371\)
   - Agent 2: \(25 + 15 + 41 + 98 + 37 + 34 = 250\)
   - Agent 3: \(86 + 50 + 21 + 32 + 56 + 80 = 325\)
   - Agent 4: \(86 + 28 + 93 + 25 + 69 + 10 = 311\)

2. **Identify the Most Preferred Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 prefers item 2 with a value of 91.
   - Agent 1 prefers item 3 with a value of 96.
   - Agent 2 prefers item 3 with a value of 98.
   - Agent 3 prefers item 0 with a value of 86.
   - Agent 4 prefers item 2 with a value of 93.

3. **Iterate and Assign Items:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (highest preference).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest preference).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (next highest preference).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (second-highest preference).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (second-highest preference).

This allocation attempts to balance preferences while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent's preferences are considered to the greatest extent possible given the constraints.
