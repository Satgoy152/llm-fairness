Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  88  87  78  42  79
1  61  86  89  17  74  77
2  33  21  36  95  83   3
3  99  87  84  33  79   4
4  37  60  46  76  27  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that no agent feels another agent has received a more valuable set of items based on their valuations. One common approach for such problems is to use a method that ensures each agent gets a bundle of items they value as much as possible, while keeping in mind the total number of items is fixed.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [37, 88, 87, 78, 42, 79]
Agent 1: [61, 86, 89, 17, 74, 77]
Agent 2: [33, 21, 36, 95, 83, 3]
Agent 3: [99, 87, 84, 33, 79, 4]
Agent 4: [37, 60, 46, 76, 27, 84]
```

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing total utility for each agent while ensuring no envy:

1. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most (99), so assign item 0 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (95), so assign item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (89), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (88), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 the most (84), so assign item 5 to Agent 4.
6. The remaining item is item 4, which Agent 1 values second-most (74) after already getting item 2, and no other agent values it more than item(s) they have already got. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation should ensure that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, minimizing envy.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```
