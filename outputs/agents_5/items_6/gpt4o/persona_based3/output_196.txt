Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  35  72  24  88  35
1   9   3  57   7   9  79
2  97  11  74  51  38   2
3   4  12  52  81  30  29
4  78   1  42  54  64  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value and ideally minimize envy among agents. A common approach is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's the table of valuations for clarity:

```
       0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent
0     63  35  72  24  88  35
1      9   3  57   7   9  79
2     97  11  74  51  38   2
3      4  12  52  81  30  29
4     78   1  42  54  64  40
```

To facilitate an envy-free and fair allocation:

1. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 2 (value 97).
2. **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 0 (value 35).
3. **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 0 (value 72).
4. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 3 (value 81).
5. **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 0 (value 88).
6. **Item 5** is most valued by Agent 1 (value 79).

Following this analysis, we can make the allocation as follows:

- Allocate items 0 to Agent 2.
- Allocate items 1, 2, and 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 4 receives no items since none of the items are valued highly enough by them compared to other agents.

This allocation respects the principle of maximizing each agent's individual utility without creating significant envy between agents, given the constraint.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": []
}
```
