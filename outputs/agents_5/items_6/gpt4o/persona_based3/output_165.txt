Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  26  89  87  69   8
1  79  15  76  70  38  90
2  80  67  12  14  59  57
3  68  63  42  63  61  72
4  98  56  33  68  71  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations provided, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the nature of the problem and the small number of items relative to the number of agents, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible, but we will attempt to minimize envy as much as possible.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent 0: 98  26  89  87  69   8
Agent 1: 79  15  76  70  38  90
Agent 2: 80  67  12  14  59  57
Agent 3: 68  63  42  63  61  72
Agent 4: 98  56  33  68  71  54
```

A possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item. However, because there are more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 and Agent 4 both have the highest valuation (98). Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most (67). Assign to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (89). Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (87). Assign to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it the most (71). Assign to Agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (90). Assign to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation

Now, let's express the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation and ensure that each item is allocated to an agent who values it highly, while still distributing the items across multiple agents.
