Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  62   8  76  98  23
1  41  25  98  58   4  38
2  91  57  68  21  87  19
3  31  19  49  31   7  56
4  66  67  36  84  32  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, which means each agent should prefer their allocation over others. One approach to achieve this is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of the agents' utilities.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Determine the Utility for Each Pair**: Calculate the total utility each agent gets from each item.

2. **Initial Assignment Based on Highest Value**: Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This will provide an initial allocation that we can adjust to reduce envy.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Reallocate items to ensure each agent feels their allocation is fair. This can involve trade-offs where some agents might slightly reduce their utility for a more equitable distribution.

4. **Ensure Envy-Freeness**: Verify that each agent's allocation is better or equal in value to any other agent's allocation. Adjust if necessary.

Here's how you can allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 91)
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 62)
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 98)
- Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value 84)
- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 98)
- Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 56)

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item except for agent 2, who gets item 0 as their highest valued item. The allocation also distributes items in a way that attempts to minimize envy. This allocation is one possible fair division based on the given valuations.
