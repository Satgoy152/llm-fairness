Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  43  37  64  90   4
1  28  90  15  32  55  44
2  23   4  88  25  56  54
3  71  83  12  42  38  49
4  78   9  42  22  87  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own. Given the agents' valuations, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: 4 (value: 90)
   - Next highest valued item: 3 (value: 64)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: 1 (value: 90)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: 2 (value: 88)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item: 1 (value: 83)
   - Next highest valued item: 0 (value: 71)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued item: 5 (value: 91)

To ensure fairness, we'll allocate the highest valued items to each agent first, and then allocate the remaining items to achieve an envy-free division:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (value: 90)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value: 90)
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (value: 88)
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (value: 71)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 4 (value: 91)

Now, we have item 3 left. We'll allocate it to the agent who can increase their total value the most without making others envious, considering the remaining value needed:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (value: 42)

Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [0, 3]
- Agent 4: [5]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives their most valued or highly valued items, while distributing the remaining item to maintain fairness.
