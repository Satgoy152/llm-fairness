Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99   2  77  91   2  80
1  78  84  92  42  72  37
2  50  80   2  89  53  88
3  27  84   8  31  20  99
4  24  93  62  89  43  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly while ensuring envy-freeness and completeness (all items are allocated), we need to consider the preferences of each agent. Our aim is to distribute these items such that each agent receives an integer number of items according to their valuations, and no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuations.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 0 (value 99) and item 3 (value 91). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 92). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 5 (value 88). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 5 (value 99), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 1 (value 84). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 1 (value 93), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 3 (value 89). Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, let's check the remaining unallocated item:

- Item 4 is the only unallocated item, and it has a decent value for Agent 1 (value 72), so assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 3

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
