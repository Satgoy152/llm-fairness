Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  93  35  72   9  79
1  54  95  50  97  48  21
2  20  48  19  69  26  94
3  26  89  98  32  79  29
4  37  15  80  69  21  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the 6 items among the 5 agents in a way that is fair and envy-free if possible. A common approach is to ensure each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while minimizing envy among agents.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **List the Agents and their Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [92, 93, 35, 72, 9, 79]
   - Agent 1: [54, 95, 50, 97, 48, 21]
   - Agent 2: [20, 48, 19, 69, 26, 94]
   - Agent 3: [26, 89, 98, 32, 79, 29]
   - Agent 4: [37, 15, 80, 69, 21, 53]

2. **Identify Item Preferences:**
   - For simplicity, we consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate those first.

3. **Initial Allocation Attempt:**
   - Assign the highest-valued item for each agent without overlaps:
     - Agent 0: Item 1 (93)
     - Agent 1: Item 3 (97)
     - Agent 2: Item 5 (94)
     - Agent 3: Item 2 (98)
     - Agent 4: Item 2 is already taken, so next highest is Item 4 (21)

4. **Resolve Conflicts and Finalize Allocation:**
   - Since Agent 3 and Agent 4 both have high values for Item 2, and Agent 3 has a notably higher value for Item 2, prioritize Agent 3.
   - Redistribute remaining items considering second-highest preferences and ensuring everyone gets at least one item if possible.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Based on preferences and resolving conflicts, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that are valued highly by them, and all items are distributed among the agents. Agent 4 receives two items due to their lower individual valuations compared to others.
