Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  87  78  64  96   1
1  81  61  36  60  28  64
2  94   4  29  10  96  42
3  90  88  34  32  11  78
4  26  59  50  70  88  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to achieve envy-freeness, ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, let's try to allocate the items so that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 highly, so we can allocate item 4 to them. 
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 highly, so we allocate item 0 to them.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to them.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 highly, so we allocate item 3 to them.
6. We are left with item 2. It could be given to **Agent 0** who has a moderate valuation for it.

Based on this reasoning, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation considers each agentâ€™s preferences, aiming to minimize envy and balance the distribution of perceived value among the agents.
