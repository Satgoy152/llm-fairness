Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  78  51  90  84  52
1  73  31  58  17  53  83
2  73  55  23  84  37  46
3  76  16  88  88  86  76
4  78  28  75  77  80  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve a fair division that minimizes envy, taking into account the valuations given in the table. Let's go through the process:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach helps to minimize envy and maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Check for conflicts**: If more than one item is allocated to a single agent, we may need to adjust to ensure each agent receives approximately the same number of items.

Let's analyze the table:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is by Agent 4 (78).
- **Item 1**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (78).
- **Item 2**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (88).
- **Item 3**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (90).
- **Item 4**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (84).
- **Item 5**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (83).

From the initial allocation based on highest values:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item [2]
- Agent 4: Item [0]

Agent 0 has too many items, so we'll need to redistribute to ensure fairness.

Adjustments:
1. Transfer Item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 2, who values it second highest (55).
2. Leave Item 3 with Agent 0 as they value it significantly higher.
3. Leave Item 4 with Agent 0 for the same reason.

Now, the allocation becomes:
- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Item [2]
- Agent 4: Item [0]

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, ensures only 6 items are allocated, and minimizes envy.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
