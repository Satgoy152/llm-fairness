Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  32  56  99  28   2
1  57  82  68  39  81  46
2  30  55  55  97  10  95
3  94  46  90  13  53  70
4  98  60  93  52  23  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will use a method that balances the total value each agent receives according to their valuations. The goal is to minimize envy, which occurs when one agent values another's allocation more than their own.

Let's summarize the steps taken to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: [67, 32, 56, 99, 28, 2]
   - Agent 1: [57, 82, 68, 39, 81, 46]
   - Agent 2: [30, 55, 55, 97, 10, 95]
   - Agent 3: [94, 46, 90, 13, 53, 70]
   - Agent 4: [98, 60, 93, 52, 23, 55]

2. **Determine Optimal Allocation:**
   - Start by identifying which items are most valued by each agent and allocate them accordingly to maximize individual satisfaction while minimizing envy.
   - Consider different combinations to balance the total value each agent receives.

3. **Assign Items:**
   - Based on the valuation table, assign items to agents ensuring that each agent feels their allocation is fair relative to their own valuations.

Let's proceed to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has a high value for item 3.
- Agent 1 values items 1 and 4 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 5 as their highest.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most.

**Allocations:**

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and it is designed to minimize envy based on their respective valuations.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the values each agent receives based on their preferences, leading to a fair division.
