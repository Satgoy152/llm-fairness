Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  38   7  63  56   8
1  85  71  95  46  98  25
2   0  59   9  25  47  14
3  48  50  79  23   5  42
4  61  77  69  29  66  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items. This involves considering each agent's valuation of each item and trying to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that they prefer or value highly.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [30, 38, 7, 63, 56, 8]
- Agent 1: [85, 71, 95, 46, 98, 25]
- Agent 2: [0, 59, 9, 25, 47, 14]
- Agent 3: [48, 50, 79, 23, 5, 42]
- Agent 4: [61, 77, 69, 29, 66, 81]

We can employ an allocation strategy that attempts to give each agent one of their most valued items while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is six.

One possible fair allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as this item is their highest valued.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 4, as this item is their highest valued.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as this item has a high value for them.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 3, as this item is highly valued by them.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as this item has the highest value for them.
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it complements their allocation and maintains balance.

This allocation attempts to maximize individual satisfaction while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation excessively.

Hereâ€™s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.
