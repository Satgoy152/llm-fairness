Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  26  39  21   3  47
1  99  49  42  86  46  14
2   1   4  70  91  79  32
3  77  29  47  94  68  65
4  53  50  90  99  56  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's preferences and attempt to minimize envy. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

One approach is to use the "Envy-Free" allocation principle, where each agent believes they have received the best bundle given the constraints. A simple method to attempt this is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and no agent is left without any item.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 5 the highest at 47. Assign item 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the highest at 99. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the highest at 91. Assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 0, but that's also taken. Next is item 4 at 68. Assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 2 at 90. Assign item 2 to agent 4.
6. **Remaining item (Item 1)**: Assign to the agent who values it the most among those who can use a second item. Agent 4 values it the highest at 50. Assign item 1 to agent 4.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by assigning each agent their highest-valued available item while ensuring every item is allocated.
