Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  36  39  21  73  36
1  89   8  62  17  58  64
2  85  60  67  25  25  34
3  49  85  42  57  19  87
4  11  85  33  57  81   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels another agent has received a more valuable allocation, based on their own valuations.

One approach to achieving this is to use the envy-free allocation method such as the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which often results in allocations that are envy-free or close to envy-free.

Let's go through the allocation process step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item Across All Agents**: This will help us understand how much demand there is for each item.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign items to agents based on maximizing each agent's individual satisfaction while considering other agents' preferences.

3. **Adjustments for Envy-freeness**: Reassign items if necessary to minimize or eliminate envy.

Proceeding with the allocation:

- **Item 0** is valued highest by agent 1 (89). Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- **Item 1** is valued highest by agents 3 and 4 (85 each). To break the tie, assign item 1 to agent 3, who has a lower total allocation value so far.
- **Item 2** is valued highest by agent 1 (62). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
- **Item 3** is valued highest by agents 3 and 4 (57 each). Assign item 3 to agent 4 to balance allocations.
- **Item 4** is valued highest by agent 0 (73). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- **Item 5** is valued highest by agent 3 (87). Assign item 5 to agent 3.

The resulting allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 1, 5
- Agent 4: Item 3

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations received by each agent, maximizing fairness and minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
