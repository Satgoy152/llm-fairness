Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  77   4  69  76  65
1  23  94  69  58  96   5
2  58  84  61  25  92  97
3   0  84  17  53  69  67
4  14  59  55  57   9  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, aiming for envy-freeness and maximizing the total value each agent receives, we can use a strategy like the "maximum marginal utility" method, which takes into account the preferences of the agents.

Given the valuations table:

| Item/Agent | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 28 | 23 | 58 | 0  | 14 |
| 1          | 77 | 94 | 84 | 84 | 59 |
| 2          | 4  | 69 | 61 | 17 | 55 |
| 3          | 69 | 58 | 25 | 53 | 57 |
| 4          | 76 | 96 | 92 | 69 | 9  |
| 5          | 65 | 5  | 97 | 67 | 17 |

To allocate the items, we look at each agent's preferences and try to assign items such that no agent envies another. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 1** values item 1 and item 4 highly, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** values item 3 highly, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 4** should receive item 2 as it is one of the higher values for them.
5. **Agent 2** can also receive item 4 since they value it highly after item 5.
6. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most after the other allocations.

With these considerations, a possible allocation is:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [4, 5]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their preferences, minimizing envy.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
