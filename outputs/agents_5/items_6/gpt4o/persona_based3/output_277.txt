Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  30  20  50  58  24
1  37  90  57  53  75  69
2  53  66  87  45  82  14
3  80  34  84  26  20  62
4  45  20  68  60   0  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness and maximize the total utility. We have 5 agents and 6 items, so one of the agents will receive two items. The goal is to distribute items such that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given their own valuations.

Let's start by considering a simple allocation strategy based on maximizing total utility for each agent given their preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 0 the most at 85, so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 1 the highest at 90, so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 2 the highest at 87, so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: They value item 3 the highest at 26, but they value item 2 close enough (84). However, item 2 is already taken. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 as they value it the second highest at 62 which is still higher than other agents' valuations for item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: With the remaining items 3 and 4, allocate item 4 to Agent 4 as they value it at 70, the highest among the remaining options.

Now, since one agent must receive two items to distribute all 6 items, we need to consider the remaining items and assign them to an agent who gets the least satisfaction from their current allocation without increasing envy:

6. **Agent 4**: They have item 4, valued at 70, and the remaining item 3, which they value at 60, is the highest among all remaining agents' preferences for unallocated items. Thus, allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

This ensures all items are allocated and tries to minimize envy based on the highest valued unallocated item for the remaining agents. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
