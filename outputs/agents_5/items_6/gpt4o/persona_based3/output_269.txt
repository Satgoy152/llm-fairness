Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73   7  50  24  19  79
1  15  16  29  14  48  41
2  43  46   0  38  69  53
3  41  92  21  87  52  98
4  75  42  13  19  45  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to ensure that no agent feels another agent has received a more valuable set of items.

One common method to achieve this is the envy-free allocation method, which attempts to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's minimum value among the items they receive.

Given the complexity of this problem and the need to allocate each item, let's proceed with a heuristic approach to allocate the items based on the highest individual values and balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 3:** Item 5 has the highest valuation (98), so assign it to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 0:** Item 0 has a high valuation (73), assign it to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2:** Item 4 is valued highly by Agent 2 (69), assign it to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 4:** Item 1 is a relatively high-value (42) for Agent 4, so assign it to Agent 4.
5. **Agent 1:** Item 2 has a moderate value (29) for Agent 1, assign it to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 3:** Item 3 has a high value (87) for Agent 3, assign it to Agent 3.

This distribution attempts to balance the allocations based on individual high valuations and spreads the total value evenly. Let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6, as required.
