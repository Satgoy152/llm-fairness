Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  53  97  98  43  76
1  44  10  85  18  96  65
2  45  53  75  10  51   4
3  70  78  53  76  35  16
4  15  80  74   2  56  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we should consider methodologies that maximize envy-freeness, ensuring that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. One common approach to achieve this is the adjusted winner procedure, which attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and determine an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible. We will ensure that each agent gets at least one item, as we have 5 agents and 6 items.

Here is an allocation plan based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate each agent's total value across all items:
   - Agent 0: 81 + 53 + 97 + 98 + 43 + 76 = 448
   - Agent 1: 44 + 10 + 85 + 18 + 96 + 65 = 318
   - Agent 2: 45 + 53 + 75 + 10 + 51 + 4 = 238
   - Agent 3: 70 + 78 + 53 + 76 + 35 + 16 = 328
   - Agent 4: 15 + 80 + 74 + 2 + 56 + 93 = 320

2. Distribute items to minimize envy:
   - Agent 0 gets item 2: Value = 97
   - Agent 1 gets item 4: Value = 96
   - Agent 2 gets item 1: Value = 53
   - Agent 3 gets item 3: Value = 76
   - Agent 4 gets items 0 and 5: Values = 15, 93

3. Check the allocation:
   - Agent 0: [2] (Value = 97)
   - Agent 1: [4] (Value = 96)
   - Agent 2: [1] (Value = 53)
   - Agent 3: [3] (Value = 76)
   - Agent 4: [0, 5] (Value = 15 + 93 = 108)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is as fair as can be determined from the given values.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation adheres to the requirement of distributing exactly 6 items among the 5 agents and aims to balance the perceived value for each agent as equitably as possible.
