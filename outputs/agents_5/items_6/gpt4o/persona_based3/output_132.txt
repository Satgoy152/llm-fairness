Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31   5  99  35   4  93
1  83  13  48  87   2  97
2  82  95   6  60  75  64
3  88  21  16  91  69  39
4  35  38  76  68  21   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 38 76 68 21  2]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim to achieve an allocation that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy among the agents. One common method used for fair division is the Envy-Free approach, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31   5  99  35   4  93
1  83  13  48  87   2  97
2  82  95   6  60  75  64
3  88  21  16  91  69  39
4  35  38  76  68  21   2
```

We will allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations. Let's consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Total Value for Each Agent:** Assign items to agents to maximize the total value each agent perceives they receive.
2. **Greedy Assignment:** Start by assigning the highest valued item for each agent if possible, ensuring no overlap.
3. **Balance the Allocation:** Ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution of value is as balanced as possible.

Following these principles, here is a fair allocation of items:

- **Agent 0:** Gets item 2 (value 99) and item 5 (value 93).
- **Agent 1:** Gets item 0 (value 83).
- **Agent 2:** Gets item 1 (value 95).
- **Agent 3:** Gets item 3 (value 91).
- **Agent 4:** Gets item 4 (value 21).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This ensures that all 6 items are allocated, with each agent receiving items based on their highest valuations.
