Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84   0  29  97  18  19
1  81  44  36  88  80  99
2   8   7  86  49   2  11
3  40  27  26   9  54  36
4  13  49  98  36  75  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the problem of fairly allocating items among agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to it as possible. This means we want to allocate items such that no agent would prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuation matrix, let's try to allocate items to maximize the overall satisfaction and minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest (97), so it's reasonable to allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest (99), so it's reasonable to allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (86), so it's reasonable to allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the highest (54), so it's reasonable to allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 the highest (49), so it's reasonable to allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

After the allocations above, we still have item 0 left. 

6. **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 0 (84), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that respects their highest valuations, thereby aiming to minimize potential envy among the agents.
