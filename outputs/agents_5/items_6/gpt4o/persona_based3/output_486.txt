Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16   4  86  46  60  87
1  47   4  34  80  95  87
2   6  80  58  48  42  47
3  79  68  63  18  66   7
4  49  20  91  26  93  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we'll try to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible based on their preferences.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for items 2 and 5. 
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for items 4 and 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 0.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 2 but second highest for item 4, which is already taken.

Let's allocate based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5 (highest value 87).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 (highest value 95).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 1 (highest value 80).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 0 (highest value 79).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2 (highest value 91).

Now, we need to allocate item 3. Agent 1 values it highly, but since Agent 4 only has one item and values item 3 second highest (26), we can give it to Agent 4 to balance their allocation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```
