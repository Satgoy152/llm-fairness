Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  82  43  62  99  17
1  32   9  32  44  50   0
2  81  42  78  62  72  70
3  79  56   4  98  78  52
4  81  89  58  73  21  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuation of the items. Since we have 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one item each.

Here is one approach:

1. **Assign the highest valued items to agents considering each agent's preference:**

    - **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (99).
    - **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0 (32).
    - **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 0 (81), but since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 1 as per their highest preference, assign Agent 2 their next highest item, item 2 (78).
    - **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 3 (98).
    - **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 1 (89).

2. **Allocate the remaining items:**

    The remaining item is item 5. We need to choose an agent for this item. Look at the next highest values for the remaining agents who have received fewer items:

    - **Agent 0**: Already has item 4.
    - **Agent 1**: Already has item 0.
    - **Agent 2**: Already has item 2.
    - **Agent 3**: Already has item 3.
    - **Agent 4**: Already has item 1.

    Consideration for item 5:
    - Agent 0 has a valuation of 17 for item 5.
    - Agent 1 has a valuation of 0 for item 5.
    - Agent 2 has a valuation of 70 for item 5.
    - Agent 3 has a valuation of 52 for item 5.
    - Agent 4 has a valuation of 14 for item 5.

    Since Agent 2 values item 5 highly and it will not cause any envy (given their significant valuation for item 2), we can allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocation can be:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
