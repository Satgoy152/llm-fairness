Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  90  38   2  75  87
1  73  95  91  31  52  93
2  58  85  70  68  35  23
3  61   3  28   6   5  37
4  64  48  70  48  32  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, I will consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other allocation they could have received, given their valuation.

The table provided gives us the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent is content with what they receive based on their valuations. Given that there are 6 items and 5 agents, one of the agents will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's begin by considering the highest valuations to ensure that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and then balance the envy by allocating additional items accordingly.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (91).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (95).
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (85), but since item 1 is already allocated, we will consider the next highest, which is item 2 (70).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (61), but item 0 is allocated. Next is item 5 (37).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (70), but item 2 is allocated. Next is item 5 (61), but item 5 is allocated, so we consider item 0 (64), but item 0 is allocated. Finally, we choose item 4 (32) to minimize overall envy.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate one more item, ensuring no agent is left envious:

- **Agent 1** already has one item, but since they have the highest residual valuation and to balance envy, allocate one more item. The next highest available valuation for Agent 1 is item 4 (52).

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 3

This allocation aims to balance each agent's valuation as fairly as possible while ensuring that each agent receives items according to their preferences.

### JSON Format Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
