Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  25   5  38  95  84
1  92  14  10  44  76  75
2  46  15  57  29  51  90
3  27  56  25  62  46  21
4  91  23  38  93  53  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we should aim for envy-freeness, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations of the 5 agents for the 6 items, I'll try to distribute the items such that the distribution is as fair as possible based on the agents' valuations.

Let's consider the following approach to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as that doesn't result in an uneven distribution.
2. Adjust the allocations to ensure each agent receives at most 2 items, as there are 6 items and 5 agents.

Here is a fair allocation of the items based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest among all agents, so assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest among all agents, so assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest among all agents, so assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most, so assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most among all agents, so assign item 1 to agent 4.
- Item 2 is not the highest for any agent, so we'll assign it based on maximizing fairness. It could go to agent 4, who values it higher than others.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1, 2]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```
