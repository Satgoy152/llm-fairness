Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31   4  18  46  81  64
1  95  12  10  38  38  46
2  99   3  30  93  93  61
3  23  43  26  93  95   0
4  12  80  51  48  65  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents in a way that respects individual valuations and aims for envy-freeness, we can use a simple heuristic approach given the small number of agents and items. Our goal is to minimize envy by attempting to give each agent at least one high-valued item according to their personal valuations.

Let's analyze each agent's top valuations:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (81) and item 5 (64).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (95).
- **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (99) and item 3 (93).
- **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (93) and item 4 (95).
- **Agent 4** highly values item 5 (96) and item 1 (80).

Now, let's try to allocate these items while keeping envy minimal and ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 95.
2. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values this item highly at 93.
3. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 3**: Agent 3 values this item highly at 95.
4. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 4**: Agent 4 values this item highly at 96.
5. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 4**: Agent 4 also values this item highly at 80 and can handle one more item.
6. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This item has a moderate value for Agent 0 at 18, and Agent 0 is the only one without an allocation yet.

Let's summarize the allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives item 2.
- **Agent 1** receives item 0.
- **Agent 2** receives item 3.
- **Agent 3** receives item 4.
- **Agent 4** receives items 1 and 5.

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of high-valued items among agents and respects their individual preferences, thus minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
