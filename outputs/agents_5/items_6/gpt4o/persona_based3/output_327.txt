Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  61  40  92   5  54
1  41  86  32   1  92  72
2  26  40  65  34  89  58
3  47  59   4  47  46  48
4  36  30  13  61  98   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the 6 items among the 5 agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible. A common goal in fair division is to minimize envy, ensuring that no agent would prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent:**
   Each agent values the items differently. We will calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences.

2. **Determine Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   We'll use a method to allocate items one by one, ideally giving each agent their most valued available item until all items are allocated.

3. **Assign Items:**
   Using a strategy like the "maximum marginal value" rule, we allocate the item to the agent who values it the most among the remaining items. This helps in reducing potential envy.

4. **Adjust for Integer Allocation:**
   Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's now allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Highest value item for Agent 0 is item 0 (93). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 4 (92). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 4 (89), but it's taken. Next is item 2 (65). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Highest value item for Agent 3 is item 1 (59). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4:** Highest value item for Agent 4 is item 4 (98), but it's taken. Next is item 3 (61). Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Now all agents have one item each, and we have one item left (item 5). We assign this remaining item to the agent who values it the most among those who received lower value items:

- **Agent 1, 2, 3, or 4** can receive item 5. Agent 1 values it at 72, which is the highest remaining valuation, so assign item 5 to Agent 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
