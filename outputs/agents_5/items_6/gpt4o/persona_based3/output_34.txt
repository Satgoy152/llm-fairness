Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  65  40  35  41  90
1  23  84  87  87  47   5
2  89  90  43  31  31  86
3  57  76  92  21  19  41
4   0   8  77   7  23  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items based on their valuations. A common heuristic approach is to give each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since there are more agents than items, some will inevitably receive no items. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**

   - Item 0: Highest value is 89 by Agent 2.
   - Item 1: Highest value is 90 by Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Highest value is 92 by Agent 3.
   - Item 3: Highest value is 87 by Agents 1 and 1 (tie).
   - Item 4: Highest value is 47 by Agent 0 and 1 (tie).
   - Item 5: Highest value is 90 by Agent 0.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**

   When there is a tie, prioritize distribution to balance the total number of items each agent receives.

   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1. (Considering tie-breaking, Agent 1 could get this to balance items).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0. (Considering tie-breaking and balance in numbers).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

3. **Final Allocation:**

   After distributing based on highest values and breaking ties considering balance, we have:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to an agent who values it highly, while striving to distribute items evenly among those with high valuations to maintain balance. Agent 4 does not receive any items because their valuations are significantly lower across the board, and tie-breaking favored others to achieve balance.
