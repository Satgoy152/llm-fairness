Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  56   3  92  43  84
1  47  51  97  61  78  22
2   8  81  66  47  67  58
3   0  65  14  64  79  90
4  25  54  79  73   5  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and no items are left unallocated, we can use an approach based on maximizing total satisfaction while ensuring fairness. One possible method is to assign items based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item and balance the allocation to ensure it is fair.

Here's a possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 5.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 4.

Based on this simple greedy allocation, let's distribute the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, and the allocations are based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item, ensuring fairness to the degree possible with such a greedy approach.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation assigns one or two items to each agent based on their highest valuations, ensuring all items are distributed.
