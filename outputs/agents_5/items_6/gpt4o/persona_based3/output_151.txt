Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  66  69  50  63  13
1  24  71  24   7  47  99
2  94  62  28  59  60  50
3  22  85  74  90  41  45
4  76  21  32  47  54   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for a distribution that minimizes envy, meaning that each agent should value their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Since there are 6 items and 5 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will each receive 1 item.

Let's break down the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Values highest item 2 (69) then item 1 (66)
- **Agent 1**: Values highest item 5 (99)
- **Agent 2**: Values highest item 0 (94)
- **Agent 3**: Values highest item 3 (90)
- **Agent 4**: Values highest item 0 (76), but second-highest is item 4 (54)

Considering these valuations, we start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent. Then, we will assign the remaining item to the agent who values it the most and doesn't create significant envy.

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as they value it the most (99).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the most (94).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as they value it the most (90).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it second highest (66).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as it is their second highest value (54).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (2):

6. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest among the unassigned items (69). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation aims to minimize envy and ensure that every agent receives items they value highly.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
