Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  61  65  21  58  79
1  70  53   2  64  70  71
2  55  23  73  40  62  14
3  68  68  56   2  41  18
4  51   9  68  15  29  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for a solution that minimizes envy, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. Given the constraints and the agents' valuations, we will try to assign items to maximize each agent's satisfaction as much as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Valuation: 50, 61, 65, 21, 58, 79
   - Highest valuation item: Item 5 (79)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuation: 70, 53, 2, 64, 70, 71
   - Highest valuation item: Item 0 (70)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuation: 55, 23, 73, 40, 62, 14
   - Highest valuation item: Item 2 (73)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Valuation: 68, 68, 56, 2, 41, 18
   - Highest valuation item: Item 0 (68), but already allocated, next highest: Item 1 (68)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Valuation: 51, 9, 68, 15, 29, 86
   - Highest valuation item: Item 5 (86), but already allocated, next highest: Item 2 (68), but already allocated, next highest: Item 4 (29)

Taking the above considerations into account, we will allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Item 5
- **Agent 1**: Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Item 2
- **Agent 3**: Item 1
- **Agent 4**: Item 4

We still have one item left (Item 3). Since Agent 4 has the least valued allocation so far, we will allocate Item 3 to Agent 4 to balance the allocations.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations each agent receives, ensuring each has at least one item they highly value, while minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.
