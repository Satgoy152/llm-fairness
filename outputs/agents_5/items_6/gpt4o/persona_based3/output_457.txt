Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93   4  83  75  40   6
1  35  40   7  14  45  46
2  87  55   1  88  21  88
3  61  63  62  80  41  65
4  30  39  96  64  57  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible with discrete items, but we can aim for a distribution that minimizes envy.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
          0   1   2   3   4   5
    0  93   4  83  75  40   6
    1  35  40   7  14  45  46
    2  87  55   1  88  21  88
    3  61  63  62  80  41  65
    4  30  39  96  64  57  11
```

Our strategy will be to allocate each item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. **Item 0**: Valued highest by Agent 0 (93).
2. **Item 1**: Valued highest by Agent 3 (63).
3. **Item 2**: Valued highest by Agent 4 (96).
4. **Item 3**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (88).
5. **Item 4**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (45).
6. **Item 5**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (88).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 2.

This allocation ensures each item is allocated and each agent receives at least one item where possible. Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation should minimize envy, as each agent receives the item(s) they value highly relative to the others.
