Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  36  12  76  78  75
1  91  60  89  38  35  91
2  52   4  80   4  71   9
3  41  67  74  45  39  18
4  31  97  61  57   3  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, though achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging with indivisible goods. We will use the valuations to guide the allocation process.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to allocating the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent has unique preferences for the items.
   - The goal is to distribute all 6 items among the 5 agents.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most, if possible.
   - Adjust allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item, if feasible, while keeping overall envy to a minimum.

3. **Agent Preferences**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who has the highest valuation for it, but ensure that all agents receive at least one item.

4. **Allocation Process**:
   - **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
   - **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most at 97.
   - **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 89.
   - **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 76.
   - **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 78.
   - **Item 5**: Agent 4 values it the most at 98.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Adjust allocations to ensure all agents receive at least one item and to reduce envy.
   - Agent 2 and Agent 3 initially have no items. We'll need to adjust allocations to include them.

6. **Final Allocation**:
   - We can swap some items to ensure all agents receive at least one item:
     - Give Item 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values some items less than others, and this item doesn't significantly lower the highest valuation.
     - Move Item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 3 to ensure Agent 3 receives an item.

After these adjustments, the final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items fairly while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, considering their preferences and minimizing envy.
