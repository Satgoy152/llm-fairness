Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  19  67   8  23  42
1  65  83  23  51  30   9
2  75  96  94  58  60   2
3  63  50   5  66  47  12
4  57  76  54  71  94  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraints and the valuations, here is one way to allocate the items:

First, let's look at the valuations matrix:

```
Agent 0: [18, 19, 67,  8, 23, 42]
Agent 1: [65, 83, 23, 51, 30,  9]
Agent 2: [75, 96, 94, 58, 60,  2]
Agent 3: [63, 50,  5, 66, 47, 12]
Agent 4: [57, 76, 54, 71, 94, 70]
```

Considering the valuations, we try to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their share as much as possible. A possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (value 67)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (value 83)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (value 75)
- **Agent 3**: Item 3 (value 66)
- **Agent 4**: Item 4 (value 94) and Item 5 (value 70)

This allocation is chosen because:

- Agent 0 gets item 2, which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 1 gets item 1, which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 2 gets item 0, their second-highest valued item after item 1 which is already chosen by Agent 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 3, which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 4 gets items 4 and 5, both high-valued for them, maximizing their total value.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is six, as required.
