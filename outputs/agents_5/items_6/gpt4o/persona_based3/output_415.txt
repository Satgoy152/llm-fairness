Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  44  27  21  82  12
1  51  13  71  95   8  57
2   9  50  21  29  39  55
3   5  99  76  73   0   1
4  49  70  33  90  97  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness as a guiding principle. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Given the valuations of the items by the agents, one approach is to use an algorithm that aims for envy-free outcomes, such as the Adjusted Winner or the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, though these are complex. A simpler heuristic approach can also be used for smaller problems like this.

To allocate the items as fairly as possible while making sure each agent gets an integer number of items, we can consider each agent's highest valued items first and allocate them accordingly, ensuring each item is assigned once.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (96).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (95).
3. Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (99).
4. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (97).
5. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (55).
6. We still have item 2 to allocate. Agent 1 has a strong preference for item 2 (71), so we assign it to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives an item they value highly, minimizing envy:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation assigns one item to each agent, and two items to Agent 1, who highly values both. All 6 items are allocated, and no agent is left without an item.
