Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  88  56  94  30  79
1  64  68  49  29  95   2
2   5  62  78  79  64  21
3  76  99  11  53  28  87
4  70  41  27  37  31  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division, we aim to allocate the items such that envy is minimized among agents. This is often referred to as an "envy-free" allocation. While it can be challenging to achieve complete envy-freeness, we can attempt to distribute the items in a way that best approximates this goal based on the agents' valuations.

First, let's consider each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0: 58 + 88 + 56 + 94 + 30 + 79 = 405
- Agent 1: 64 + 68 + 49 + 29 + 95 + 2 = 307
- Agent 2: 5 + 62 + 78 + 79 + 64 + 21 = 309
- Agent 3: 76 + 99 + 11 + 53 + 28 + 87 = 354
- Agent 4: 70 + 41 + 27 + 37 + 31 + 67 = 273

Now, let's attempt a fair allocation by considering the highest value items for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 3 the highest at 94.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 4 the highest at 95.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 2 the highest at 78.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 1 the highest at 99.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 0 the highest at 70.

This initial allocation leaves item 5 unallocated. We will assign it to the agent who has the least total value from their current allocation:

- Agent 0 has item 3: 94
- Agent 1 has item 4: 95
- Agent 2 has item 2: 78
- Agent 3 has item 1: 99
- Agent 4 has item 0: 70

Agent 2 has the lowest value, so let's give item 5 to Agent 2.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [0]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items, trying to balance the valuations.
