Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  60  79  60  83  50
1  91  70  98  89  25  19
2  28  59  77   7  54  29
3  33  40  46  73  38  16
4   0  61  82  29  50  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 59 77  7 54 29]

 [ 0 61 82 29 50 79]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own. Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 30     | 60     | 79     | 60     | 83     | 50     |
| 1     | 91     | 70     | 98     | 89     | 25     | 19     |
| 2     | 28     | 59     | 77     | 7      | 54     | 29     |
| 3     | 33     | 40     | 46     | 73     | 38     | 16     |
| 4     | 0      | 61     | 82     | 29     | 50     | 79     |

To achieve a fair allocation, consider the following distribution:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the most (91).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the most (60).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the most (98).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it the most (73).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the most (83).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it the most (79).

This allocation ensures each agent receives the item(s) they value highly, minimizing envy:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives no items.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives item 5.

The final allocations in the specified JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
