Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  29   1  87  78  86
1  81  13  74  94   0  75
2  26  88  26  83  98  37
3  83  67  28  31  13  48
4   8   6  31  50  56  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we need to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Given the complexity of perfectly achieving envy-freeness, we aim to approximate it by minimizing the maximum envy any agent feels towards another's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **List Total Valuations:** Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   
2. **Initial Allocation by Maximum Valuation:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This might not result in envy-freeness, so adjustments might be needed.

3. **Balance the Allocations:** Adjust allocations to ensure that the overall distribution of value is as balanced as possible.

Let's look at the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 19 + 29 + 1 + 87 + 78 + 86 = 300
- Agent 1: 81 + 13 + 74 + 94 + 0 + 75 = 337
- Agent 2: 26 + 88 + 26 + 83 + 98 + 37 = 358
- Agent 3: 83 + 67 + 28 + 31 + 13 + 48 = 270
- Agent 4: 8 + 6 + 31 + 50 + 56 + 11 = 162

**Initial Allocation:**
- Item 0: Agent 1 (81)
- Item 1: Agent 2 (88)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (74)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (94)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (98)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (86)

**Adjustments for Balance:**
- Agent 1 has three items, and Agent 0 two items, whereas Agent 3 and 4 have none. We need to adjust the allocations to distribute items more evenly.

**Final Adjusted Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [2]

This allocation assigns all items to agents with the aim of balancing the total value received by each, considering initial preferences.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
