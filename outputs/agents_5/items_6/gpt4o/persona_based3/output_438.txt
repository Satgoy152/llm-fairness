Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  58  91  59  16  84
1  14  87  87  23  36  70
2  13  30   2  73  93  61
3   5  69  41  76  52  12
4  81  18  97  10  81  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the fair division problem with envy-freeness considerations, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent perceives they have received a fair share relative to their valuations. There are various methods, such as ensuring proportionality, maximizing the sum of utilities, or minimizing envy. Given the valuations from the table, we can proceed by considering these factors to propose an initial allocation. 

We'll ensure that each agent gets a fair portion of items based on their valuations, with the understanding that the specific definition of fairness can vary. Here, we will attempt to balance the total value each agent receives as much as possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [72, 58, 91, 59, 16, 84]
Agent 1: [14, 87, 87, 23, 36, 70]
Agent 2: [13, 30, 2, 73, 93, 61]
Agent 3: [5, 69, 41, 76, 52, 12]
Agent 4: [81, 18, 97, 10, 81, 61]
```

We aim to allocate these items to agents in a way that maximizes their perceived value, trying to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly (91), and item 5 (84).
2. Agent 1 values items 1 and 2 (both 87).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highly (93).
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highly (76).
5. Agent 4 values item 2 highly (97).

Considering these observations, one possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 5 (valued at 72 and 84)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (valued at 87)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (valued at 93)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (valued at 76)
- Agent 4: Item 2 (valued at 97)

This allocation attempts to distribute items according to the highest valuations, trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items in a manner that reflects their highest valuations, aiming for a fair and envy-free distribution.
