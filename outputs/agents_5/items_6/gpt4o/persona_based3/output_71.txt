Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  36  14  81  41  87
1  70  57  69  89  94  13
2   9  32  47  40  59  62
3  27  14  58  55  51  62
4  20  55  53  26  19  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a heuristic approach. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations, and no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Let's consider the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:** First, compute the total valuation for each item across all agents to understand its overall desirability.

2. **Greedy Allocation:** Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

3. **Refinement for Fairness:** Adjust allocations to minimize envy, ensuring that agents feel they have received a comparable value.

4. **Ensure Completeness:** Verify that exactly six items are allocated.

Let's apply this approach to the given data:

### Total Valuation of Each Item:
- Item 0: 96 + 70 + 9 + 27 + 20 = 222
- Item 1: 36 + 57 + 32 + 14 + 55 = 194
- Item 2: 14 + 69 + 47 + 58 + 53 = 241
- Item 3: 81 + 89 + 40 + 55 + 26 = 291
- Item 4: 41 + 94 + 59 + 51 + 19 = 264
- Item 5: 87 + 13 + 62 + 62 + 14 = 238

### Initial Greedy Allocation:
- Item 0: Agent 0 (96)
- Item 1: Agent 4 (55)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (69)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (89)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (94)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (87)

### Adjust for Fairness and Completeness:
- Agent 1 has too many items. Reassign one to another agent.
- Reassign Item 2 to Agent 3 (58), as Agent 3 has no items and values it relatively well.
- Now, Agent 1 has Items 3 and 4, Agent 0 has Items 0 and 5, Agent 4 has Item 1, and Agent 3 has Item 2.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 5]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [1]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
