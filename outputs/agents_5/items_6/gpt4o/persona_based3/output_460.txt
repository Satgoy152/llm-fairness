Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  80  82  66  26  26
1  53  86  98  28  33  47
2  24  92  68  31  35  71
3  62  14   7  29  24  19
4  42  99  89  25  22  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received an adequate share based on their valuations. Given the constraints of integer allocations and the need for a total of 6 items to be distributed, we can proceed by considering each agent's preferences and maximizing their satisfaction.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 and item 1 highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 highly.
   - Agent 3 has lower values across items, but item 0 is relatively higher.
   - Agent 4 values item 1 highly.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - **Agent 0:** Since agents 1 and 2 have a higher valuation for item 2, let's give Agent 0 items that are relatively valuable to them and not contested. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 1:** Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.
   - **Agent 2:** Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as they have a high valuation for it.
   - **Agent 3:** Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it is relatively more valuable than other items for them.
   - **Agent 4:** Assign item 5 to Agent 4, as it has a high value for them and is not highly contested.
   - Assign the remaining item (item 4) to Agent 4 as well, since it maximizes their remaining allocation satisfaction.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences to the greatest extent possible given the constraints and ensures that all items are allocated.
