Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  10   5  73  67  27
1   3  95   3  95  83  20
2  87  19  16   6  78  99
3  11  31  38  91  30  25
4  74  68  90  67  22  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach in fair division is to aim for an envy-free allocation if possible, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 0, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations for items 1 and 3.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations for items 0, 4, and 5.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuations for items 2 and 0.

Let's try to allocate the items while considering these preferences:

- **Item 0**: Valued highly by agents 0, 2, and 4. Allocate to **Agent 2** for their highest overall valuation.
- **Item 1**: Valued highly by agent 1. Allocate to **Agent 1**.
- **Item 2**: Valued highly by agent 4. Allocate to **Agent 4**.
- **Item 3**: Valued highly by agents 0, 1, and 3. Allocate to **Agent 0** for their second highest valuation.
- **Item 4**: Valued highly by agents 0 and 2. Allocate to **Agent 0** for their third highest valuation.
- **Item 5**: Valued highly by agent 2. Allocate to **Agent 2**.

Now, each agent should have at least one item, and no more than the allocated items should be given. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
