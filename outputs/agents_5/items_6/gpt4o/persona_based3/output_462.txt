Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  58  32  86  35  16
1  12  80  21   2   9  18
2  38  86  59  96  63  77
3   1  77  31  15   4  20
4   4   9  93  82  48  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 6 items to the 5 agents such that the division is as fair as possible. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their utility based on their valuations of the items, while minimizing envy among agents.

The table of valuations is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 51     | 58     | 32     | 86     | 35     | 16     |
| 1     | 12     | 80     | 21     | 2      | 9      | 18     |
| 2     | 38     | 86     | 59     | 96     | 63     | 77     |
| 3     | 1      | 77     | 31     | 15     | 4      | 20     |
| 4     | 4      | 9      | 93     | 82     | 48     | 36     |

To allocate the items, we will try to follow these steps:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Look for items that have significantly higher valuations by specific agents and try to allocate those items to those agents.
2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item:** Ideally, everyone should receive at least one item, but since there are more agents than items, at least one agent will receive more than one item.
3. **Minimize Envy:** Try to allocate items such that no agent feels another's allocation is significantly better than their own.

Considering these steps, we can make a first attempt at allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Item 3 (highest value for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1:** Item 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2:** Item 5 (second-highest value for Agent 2) - Agent 2 has high valuations for many items, but to balance the distribution, we give them Item 5.
- **Agent 3:** Item 2 (reasonable value for Agent 3 compared to others)
- **Agent 4:** Item 4 (highest value for Agent 4)

This leaves us with Item 0, which hasn't been allocated yet. We will allocate it to Agent 2 as they have relatively high valuations across the board and it provides a fair balance.

Here is the proposed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect the agents' preferences as much as possible, given the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.
