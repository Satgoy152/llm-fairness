Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  87  95  31  34  49
1  16  70  77  49  94  11
2  41  30  84  56   5  16
3  32  24  78  70  54  94
4  26  71   9  88  26  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations to minimize envy and achieve a balanced distribution. We can use the method of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each receives at least one item, given that there are more agents than items.

Let's allocate the items step by step, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 94).

2. **Agent 1**: High valuations for items 4 and 2. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 94).

3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 2. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (value 84).

4. **Agent 3**: High valuations for items 5 and 3. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 3 (value 94).

5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 3. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 4 (value 88).

Now each agent has received one item, ensuring a fair distribution. However, we still have item 1 left:

6. **Item 1**: Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one high-value item based on their preferences, minimizing envy and achieving a fair distribution.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
