Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  22  85   3  71  86
1  47  89  67  13  36  78
2  52  29  98  13  50  83
3  18  43   6  40  94   3
4  96  40  73  75  29  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the allocation of items given to another agent over their own allocation. While achieving perfect envy-freeness in every situation can be complex, we can aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's start by examining the agents' preferences for each item and try to distribute items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item wherever possible.

### Valuations Table:
```
    Items
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  22  85   3  71  86
1  47  89  67  13  36  78
2  52  29  98  13  50  83
3  18  43   6  40  94   3
4  96  40  73  75  29  73
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Has a high valuation for item 5 (86), let's allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 1 (89), allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 2 (98), allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a high valuation for item 4 (94), allocate item 4 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has a high valuation for item 0 (96), allocate item 0 to agent 4.
6. The remaining item is item 3. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for this item (75), allocate item 3 to agent 4.

By this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is relatively fair based on their valuations.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the distribution aims to respect the highest valuations as much as possible given the constraints.
