Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  88  53  41   1  83
1  86  31  51  39  90  39
2  27  99  70  36  35  73
3  83  67  27  72  67  22
4   2  46  67  47   4  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. While achieving perfect envy-freeness with discrete items and arbitrary valuations is complex, we aim to minimize envy and distribute the items as fairly as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Values highest are items 1 (88) and 5 (83).
- **Agent 1**: Values highest are items 4 (90) and 0 (86).
- **Agent 2**: Values highest are items 1 (99) and 2 (70).
- **Agent 3**: Values highest are items 0 (83) and 3 (72).
- **Agent 4**: Values highest are items 2 (67) and 3 (47).

A potential fair allocation could be:

- Give item 1 to Agent 0 (high valuation of 88).
- Give item 4 to Agent 1 (high valuation of 90).
- Give item 2 to Agent 2 (high valuation of 70).
- Give item 0 to Agent 3 (high valuation of 83).
- Give item 3 to Agent 4 (decent valuation of 47).
- Give item 5 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation of 83).

This allocation aims to balance the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring each gets at least one item. Agent 0 receives two items, but both are highly valued by them, maximizing their satisfaction while minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```
