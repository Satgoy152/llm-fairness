Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  45  73  82  70   0
1  20  41  95  71  87  52
2  23  51  46  35  77  42
3  42  42  90  77  37  83
4  87  37  25  94   1  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for a division that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent values their assigned bundle at least as much as they would value any other agent's bundle. Given the valuations matrix, let's try to find an allocation that achieves this.

Here is the valuations matrix for reference:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 72 | 45 | 73 | 82 | 70 |  0 |
| 1          | 20 | 41 | 95 | 71 | 87 | 52 |
| 2          | 23 | 51 | 46 | 35 | 77 | 42 |
| 3          | 42 | 42 | 90 | 77 | 37 | 83 |
| 4          | 87 | 37 | 25 | 94 |  1 | 71 |

A potential strategy is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuation preference, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent. Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (82)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (95)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (77)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (83)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (87)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, all items except Item 1 have been allocated. We need to allocate Item 1 to one of the agents. Evaluating the remaining options:

- **Agent 1** can take Item 1 as it has a fair valuation (41) compared to others.

Thus, the allocation of the remaining item is:

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```
