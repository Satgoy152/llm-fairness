Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  94  47  16  19   2
1   0  99  61  85  12  59
2  99  85  83  57  39  88
3  47  99  65  31  22  31
4  87  14  26  77  55  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 99 61 85 12 59]
 [99 85 83 57 39 88]
 [47 99 65 31 22 31]
 [87 14 26 77 55 59]]
Output:
To find a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness and attempt to satisfy it as much as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of the other agents.

### Valuations Matrix:
| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 44     | 94     | 47     | 16     | 19     | 2      |
| 1     | 0      | 99     | 61     | 85     | 12     | 59     |
| 2     | 99     | 85     | 83     | 57     | 39     | 88     |
| 3     | 47     | 99     | 65     | 31     | 22     | 31     |
| 4     | 87     | 14     | 26     | 77     | 55     | 59     |

### Strategy:
1. Assign items to agents based on their highest value for an item that has not been allocated yet.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Check for envy-freeness and adjust if necessary.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Agent 2** values Item 0 the highest among all agents (99). Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** values Item 1 the highest among remaining items (94). Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** values Item 3 the highest among remaining items (85). Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 4** values Item 4 the highest among remaining items (55). Assign Item 4 to Agent 4.
5. **Agent 3** values Item 2 the highest among remaining items (65). Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.
6. One item remains, Item 5. It needs to be assigned to ensure all items are allocated. Agent 2 values Item 5 the highest among remaining unallocated items (88). Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the individual values for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
