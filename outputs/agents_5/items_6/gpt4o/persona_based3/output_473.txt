Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  84  76  33   8  54
1  96  52  19  64  49  77
2  22  33  27  63  14  77
3  95  37  65  22   0  60
4  92  99  21  85  43  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare or using the Envy-Free up to One Good (EF1) criterion. However, since this is a small problem with only 5 agents and 6 items, a direct heuristic approach can also be considered.

Looking at the valuations matrix, the goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences.

1. **Allocate high-value items first:**
   - Agent 4 highly values item 1 (99), so assign item 1 to agent 4.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (96), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
   - Agent 3 highly values item 0 (95), but it's already assigned, so consider next best options.

2. **Consider remaining items and their values:**
   - Item 5 is valued highly by agent 1 (77), but agent 3 also values item 5 (60).
   - Agent 3 values item 2 (65), so assign item 2 to agent 3.
   - Agent 0 has high value for item 1 but it's already assigned, so consider next best options.

3. **Allocate remaining items to minimize unallocated items and balance total allocations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 (54), so assign item 5 to agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 (63), so assign item 3 to agent 2.
   - Agent 4 highly values item 4 (43), so assign item 4 to agent 4.

After these considerations, we need to ensure that each agent has at least one item, and there are no unallocated items remaining. Based on the above allocation, agent 1 and agent 3 have no items currently, so we need to adjust:

- Reconsider giving a low-value item to an agent with no items.

The final allocation should look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items in a way that considers the highest individual valuations and ensures each agent receives at least one item, given the constraints.
