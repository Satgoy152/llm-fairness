Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50   9  63  58  49  23
1  73  91   9  37  69  62
2  77  47  32  76  26  13
3  99  18  67  46  24  21
4  94  65  14  40  80  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, while also considering the distribution of the total value each agent receives.

Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. **Assign items based on highest valuation**: We initially try to assign items to agents who value them the most. This is a common strategy to reduce envy.

2. **Adjust for fairness**: We then need to make sure that no agent feels that another agent has significantly more value than they do. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Assign item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most (99), so assign it to agent 3.
2. **Assign item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most (91), so assign it to agent 1.
3. **Assign item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (63), so assign it to agent 0.
4. **Assign item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most (76), so assign it to agent 2.
5. **Assign item 4**: Agent 4 values it the most (80), so assign it to agent 4.
6. **Assign item 5**: Agent 4 values it second highest after their allocation, but agent 1 values it more than any other unassigned item (62), so assign it to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item (except for agent 0, who gets one) and that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing the value each agent receives from their items.
