Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  74  29  71  91   2
1  72  79  23   6  70  13
2  11  53  53  88  62  52
3   7  57  54  58  60  64
4  36  99  62  16  62  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's preferences and valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items such that no agent envies another's allocation, if possible.

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use an algorithm that iteratively assigns items to agents based on their highest relative value, ensuring a balanced distribution of total value.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that are relatively most valuable to Agent 0. Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 0 at 91, making it a strong candidate.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that are relatively most valuable to Agent 1. Item 1 is highly valued at 79.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that are relatively most valuable to Agent 2. Item 3 is highly valued at 88.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that are relatively most valuable to Agent 3. Item 5 is highly valued at 64.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items that are relatively most valuable to Agent 4. Item 0 is highly valued at 36, and item 2 is valued at 62.

With this allocation, we aim to have a fair distribution of value according to each agent's preferences. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a portion of the items based on their preferences.
