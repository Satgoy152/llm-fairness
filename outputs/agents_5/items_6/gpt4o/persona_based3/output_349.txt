Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  57   6  50  28  79
1  54  99  20  51  28  63
2  41  82  38  30  27  74
3  14  51  59  80  11  31
4  16  39  37  41  91  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can utilize a method such as the "envy-free" allocation. However, given the constraints and the valuations, achieving strict envy-freeness might be challenging. Instead, we aim for a division that approximates fairness as closely as possible while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with a simplified, practical approach to allocate the items:

1. **Highest Valuation Method**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Following this approach, let's determine the allocations:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (54)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 1 (99)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 3 (59)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 3 (80)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 4 (91)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (79)

Here's the tentative allocation:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [2, 3]
- Agent 4: [4]

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while attempting to minimize envy and ensuring all items are allocated.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
