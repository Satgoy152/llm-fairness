Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  84  79  22  29  51
1   7  33  96  46  62  96
2  87  47  69  18  97  46
3   4  25  98  24   4  65
4  13  81  19  49   6  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51 84 79 22 29 51]
 [ 7 33 96 46 62 96]
 [87 47 69 18 97 46]
 [ 4 25 98 24  4 65]
 [13 81 19 49  6 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize the perceived value of the allocation by each agent while ensuring no envy, or at least minimizing envy. Each agent should ideally receive items in a way that reflects their preferences as much as possible.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [51, 84, 79, 22, 29, 51]
Agent 1: [7, 33, 96, 46, 62, 96]
Agent 2: [87, 47, 69, 18, 97, 46]
Agent 3: [4, 25, 98, 24, 4, 65]
Agent 4: [13, 81, 19, 49, 6, 27]
```

We'll try to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is maximized based on their individual preferences.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 with 97, so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 with 96 and item 5 with 96, so allocate items 2 and 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 with 84, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3 with 98, so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** will get the remaining item, which is item 0.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is designed to maximize the total perceived value for each agent based on their preferences.
