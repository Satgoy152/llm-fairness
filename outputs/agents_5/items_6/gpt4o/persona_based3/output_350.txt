Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  82  22  79  18   9
1   8  68   4  90  32  47
2  73  32  70  29  66  28
3  24   5  59   0  99  59
4  68  11   2  19  21  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy by considering both the agents' valuations and the requirement that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation that attempts to achieve envy-freeness:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0. This item has the highest value for Agent 0 (82).
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1. This item has the highest value for Agent 1 (90).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2. This item has the highest value for Agent 2 (73).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3. This item has the highest value for Agent 3 (99).

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 4. This item has the highest value for Agent 4 (30).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4. This item, though low in value (2), completes the allocation and is relatively less valuable to other agents.

This allocation ensures each agent receives an item they value highly, minimizing envy.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items among the agents.
