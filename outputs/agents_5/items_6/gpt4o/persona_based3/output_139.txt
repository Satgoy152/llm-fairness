Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68   4  64  91  89  22
1  21  11  33  81  52   7
2  99  80  83  37  76  92
3  64  87  85  97  85  57
4  80  99  82  24  80  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In this fair division problem, we need to allocate 6 items among 5 agents in a manner that is as fair as possible, ideally achieving envy-freeness if feasible. Given the diversity in valuations, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, but we can strive for an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes perceived fairness.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Strategy

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent has distinct valuations, suggesting some items are significantly more valuable to certain agents than others.

2. **Strategy for Fair Allocation:**
   - Attempt to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets items they highly value, while minimizing the chance of envy.
   - Aim to balance the total perceived value each agent receives.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (91), item 4 (89), and item 0 (68). However, item 3 and item 4 are also valuable to other agents.
   - **Agent 1** has their highest valuation (81) for item 3.
   - **Agent 2** places high value on item 5 (92) and item 0 (99).
   - **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (97) and item 1 (87).
   - **Agent 4** places the highest value on item 1 (99).

4. **Proposed Allocation:**
   - **Agent 0**: Allocate item 4 (89) and item 2 (64) to Agent 0. This gives them a reasonable total value and avoids conflict over the highly contested item 3.
   - **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3 (81) to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
   - **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 (92), which is highly valued by Agent 2.
   - **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1 (87) to Agent 3, as it is their second-highest valued item.
   - **Agent 4**: Allocate item 0 (80), which is a compromise since multiple agents find item 0 valuable, but Agent 4 also values it highly.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation is designed to maintain balance and fairness by distributing items in a way that respects the highest individual valuations while attempting to minimize envy across agents.
