Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  50  41  37  66  33
1  67  21  99  99  24  63
2  56  80  85  82  87  21
3  58  61   4  40  82  85
4  94  50  81  65   6  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 50 41 37 66 33]
 [67 21 99 99 24 63]
 [56 80 85 82 87 21]
 [58 61  4 40 82 85]
 [94 50 81 65  6 77]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to achieve envy-freeness, which means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation. Given that we must allocate exactly 6 items and each agent should receive an integer number of items, let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items as equitably as possible.

### Valuation Table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 89     | 50     | 41     | 37     | 66     | 33     |
| 1     | 67     | 21     | 99     | 99     | 24     | 63     |
| 2     | 56     | 80     | 85     | 82     | 87     | 21     |
| 3     | 58     | 61     | 4      | 40     | 82     | 85     |
| 4     | 94     | 50     | 81     | 65     | 6      | 77     |

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1** highly values items 2 and 3 (99 each), so we can allocate these two items to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (87), so we can allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest (85), so we can allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (89), so we can allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the highest (94), but since it's already allocated, we can give item 1 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, minimizing envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

Each agent has received a fair share based on their valuations, and exactly 6 items have been allocated.
