Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  32  67  33  95  58
1  12  83  40   0  42  87
2  90  61  98  95  20  36
3  33  41  86  38   2  31
4  88  85  42  18  92  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that the distribution is envy-free as much as possible, taking into account the valuations each agent has for each item. We can use a simple heuristic approach to achieve a balanced allocation, such as maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, or minimizing envy by giving each agent their most preferred available item sequentially.

Let's start by considering each agent's highest valued items and allocate them iteratively while keeping track of the overall allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuation**: Item 4 (95)
2. **Agent 1's highest valuation**: Item 5 (87)
3. **Agent 2's highest valuation**: Item 2 (98)
4. **Agent 3's highest valuation**: Item 2 (86), but already allocated. Next highest is Item 1 (41)
5. **Agent 4's highest valuation**: Item 4 (92), but already allocated. Next highest is Item 0 (88)

At this point, each agent has received one item, and we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate one more item.

6. **Allocate remaining items to minimize envy**:
    - Remaining item: 3
    - It has the highest remaining valuation for Agent 2 (95), but since Agent 2 already has an item, we will give it to Agent 3, who values it more than others (38).

### Final Allocation:

Based on the above steps, the allocation of the items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the highest preferences of each agent and ensure each agent receives at least one item.
