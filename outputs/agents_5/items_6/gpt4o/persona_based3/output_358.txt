Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67   7  34   8  91  10
1  33  58  40  28  10  60
2  32  84  94   9  42  21
3  26  64  11   3  76  99
4  72  37  13  14  81   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations. Since the problem involves integer allocations and we have a small number of items, we can use a straightforward approach by assessing the total value each agent places on the items and attempting to balance these values among the agents.

Let's begin by calculating the total value each agent places on all items:

1. Agent 0: 67 + 7 + 34 + 8 + 91 + 10 = 217
2. Agent 1: 33 + 58 + 40 + 28 + 10 + 60 = 229
3. Agent 2: 32 + 84 + 94 + 9 + 42 + 21 = 282
4. Agent 3: 26 + 64 + 11 + 3 + 76 + 99 = 279
5. Agent 4: 72 + 37 + 13 + 14 + 81 + 5 = 222

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we strive to allocate items such that each agent feels they are receiving a fair value relative to other agents.

Based on the valuations, let's assign items to agents to balance these total values:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (high value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (reasonable value for Agent 1).
- Assign items 1 and 5 to Agent 2 (high values for Agent 2).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (reasonable value for Agent 3).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (high value for Agent 4).

This allocation results in the following values for each agent:

1. Agent 0: 91
2. Agent 1: 40
3. Agent 2: 84 + 21 = 105
4. Agent 3: 3
5. Agent 4: 72

While this allocation may not be perfectly envy-free, given the integer constraint and limited items, it provides a balanced approach based on the agents' valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
