Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  16  30  56  84  93
1  52  23  55  94  73  42
2  71  81  74  49  93  80
3  69  75   7  39  78   9
4  81  13   4  50  81   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum envy, which seeks to minimize the maximum difference between the value an agent attributes to their allocated items and the value they attribute to other agents' allocations. We aim to ensure that each agent receives at least one item or a fair share in the context of their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to arrive at a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Total Valuations**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items.

2. **Identify Item Importance**: For each agent, determine which items are most valuable to them.

3. **Initial Fair Division**: Start by assigning the most valued items to each agent, ensuring no agent is left with no items if possible.

4. **Reallocation for Fairness**: If any agent ends up with no items, try to reallocate such that every agent receives at least one item and the distribution remains as fair as possible.

Here is an allocation based on the above method:

- Agent 0: prefers item 5, followed by items 4, 3, 0, 2, 1.
- Agent 1: prefers item 3, followed by items 2, 0, 4, 1, 5.
- Agent 2: prefers item 4, followed by items 0, 2, 5, 1, 3.
- Agent 3: prefers item 1, followed by items 0, 4, 3, 5, 2.
- Agent 4: prefers item 0, followed by items 4, 3, 1, 2, 5.

**Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Items 0, 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and we try to balance the allocations based on the agents' preferences. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
