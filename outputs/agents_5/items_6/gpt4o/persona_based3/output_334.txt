Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  26  67  45  46   9
1  86  74  50  14  98  34
2  56  49   8  11  25   8
3  73  98  78  48  87  83
4  32  15   8  47  44  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation with a focus on envy-freeness, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent values their allocation. This will ensure that no agent envies another.

Given the agents' valuations, let's try to allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 1.
3. **Agent 2** has lower overall valuations compared to others, but we can still give them an item with a decent valuation.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for item 1, but it is already planned for Agent 1, so we will give them items they value highly next.
5. **Agent 4** has overall lower valuations but can still be given a fair allocation.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 (94) and 5 (9)
- **Agent 1**: Items 4 (98)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (11)
- **Agent 3**: Items 1 (98)
- **Agent 4**: Item 2 (8)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences, minimizing envy:

- Agent 0 gets high value from item 0.
- Agent 1 gets the highest valued item for them, item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 3, which is relatively low but fair given the overall distribution.
- Agent 3 gets item 1, which is highly valued by them.
- Agent 4 gets item 2, which is not highly valued by any agent but ensures allocation completion.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
