Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  99  32  84  13  87
1  12  29  68  89  62  85
2  61  65   6  62  80  43
3  89  26  85  54  75  58
4  13  42  65  96  31  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a fair manner, we aim to minimize envy among the agents and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll consider the valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that the allocations are as envy-free as possible.

Let's start by considering the highest-valued items for each agent and try to allocate them in a way that balances the overall valuation.

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (99) and item 5 the second highest (87). Let's assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (89) and item 5 the second highest (85). Let's assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (80). Let's assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest (89) and item 2 the second highest (85). Let's assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest (96) but it is already allocated. The next highest is item 2 (65). Let's assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we've assigned 5 items and have one remaining (item 5).

Let's evaluate the remaining item (item 5):
- Agent 0 values item 5 at 87.
- Agent 1 values item 5 at 85.
- Agent 2 values item 5 at 43.
- Agent 3 values item 5 at 58.
- Agent 4 values item 5 at 62.

The highest remaining valuation for item 5 is by Agent 0 (87). However, to maintain fairness and distribute items more evenly, it's reasonable to assign item 5 to Agent 1, who has a relatively high valuation (85) and only one item so far.

Thus, the fair allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, tries to maximize their individual valuations, and ensures a fair division based on the given preferences.
