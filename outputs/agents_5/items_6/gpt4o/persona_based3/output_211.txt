Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  53  42  84  37  31
1  87  99  70  50  42   4
2   4  56  12  53  60   1
3  34   0  61  20  57  52
4  82  17   9  68  61  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. Given that each agent has a different valuation for each item, we aim to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 1 (99). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 3 (84). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 (60) the most among unallocated items. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 5 (52) the most among unallocated items. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 0 (82) the most among unallocated items. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 0**: Item 2 is left. Agent 0 values it at 42, which is the highest among the remaining unallocated items. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

By making these assignments, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocations are balanced to minimize potential envy as much as possible. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, and the distribution takes into account the agents' preferences while trying to maintain fairness and minimize envy.
