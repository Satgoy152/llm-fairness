Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  68  14   9  17  14
1  13  78  81   0  40  83
2  45  98  57  78  52  23
3  87   2  17  35  88  93
4  58  63   4  72   4  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuation. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in all cases, especially with integer constraints, we aim for a practical and balanced allocation.

Let's start by examining each agent's preferences and try to assign items in a way that maximizes their happiness while ensuring that all items are allocated.

### Agent Valuations:
- Agent 0: [33, 68, 14, 9, 17, 14]
- Agent 1: [13, 78, 81, 0, 40, 83]
- Agent 2: [45, 98, 57, 78, 52, 23]
- Agent 3: [87, 2, 17, 35, 88, 93]
- Agent 4: [58, 63, 4, 72, 4, 51]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (98), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (93), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (81), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (33), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 3 (72), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
6. Finally, to balance the allocation, assign item 4 to **Agent 3** since their next highest preference is for item 4 (88).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, and the allocations are balanced with no unallocated items.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation is designed to be as fair as possible given the constraints, ensuring that each item is allocated and each agent receives an item aligned with their preferences.
