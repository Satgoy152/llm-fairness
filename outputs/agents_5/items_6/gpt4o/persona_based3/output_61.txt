Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  75  87  86  51   9
1  24  61  86   7   9  26
2  82  37  28  83   6  15
3  95  75   3  44  22  33
4  28  50  71  99  53  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation where possible. This means each agent should value their allocation as highly as possible compared to others, given the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step outline to find a fair allocation:

1. **List the items and their values for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [60, 75, 87, 86, 51, 9]
   - Agent 1: [24, 61, 86, 7, 9, 26]
   - Agent 2: [82, 37, 28, 83, 6, 15]
   - Agent 3: [95, 75, 3, 44, 22, 33]
   - Agent 4: [28, 50, 71, 99, 53, 30]

2. **Rank the items for each agent based on their valuations:**

   - Agent 0: 2, 3, 1, 0, 4, 5
   - Agent 1: 2, 1, 5, 0, 4, 3
   - Agent 2: 0, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4
   - Agent 3: 0, 1, 3, 5, 4, 2
   - Agent 4: 3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 0

3. **Assign items to maximize fairness and minimize envy:**

   - Start by assigning the highest-valued item for each agent, ensuring that no item is over-allocated.
   - Adjust assignments to ensure each agent receives at least one item and try to minimize any potential envy.

4. **Allocation:**

   - Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (highest valuation of 99).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest valuation of 95).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 87).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation of 75, after item 2).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (second-highest valuation of 33, after item 0).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (third-highest valuation of 53, after items 3 and 2).

5. **Ensure all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item:**

   - Agent 0: Items 1, 2
   - Agent 1: No items allocated
   - Agent 2: No items allocated
   - Agent 3: Items 0, 5
   - Agent 4: Items 3, 4

6. **Final allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest values for each agent and attempts to distribute the items as fairly as possible given the constraints. Some agents receive no items due to the limited number of items and the necessity to prioritize higher valuations.
