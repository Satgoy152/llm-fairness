Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  88   3   5  36  29
1  52  83  30  98  70  65
2  16  54  66  31  41  28
3  88  21  41  29  20  88
4   0  79  16  89  39  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where possible, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's allocation to their own. Given the valuations, one approach to achieve this is to use a method like the adjusted winner procedure, but considering the requirement for integer allocations, a practical approach is to use a heuristic method to balance the valuations.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix and choose an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 1 (88), 0 (70)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 3 (98), 4 (70)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 2 (66), 1 (54)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value items: 0 (88), 5 (88)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest value items: 5 (92), 3 (89)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

At this point, the allocations are:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 5

We still have item 4 left to allocate. The next highest bidders for item 4 are agents 0 and 1. To balance the allocations and minimize overall envy, we can allocate item 4 to Agent 1, who has slightly lower total value from their current allocation compared to Agent 0.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's highest preferences as much as possible and attempts to minimize envy.
