Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98   6  26  43  64  76
1  10  41   4  42  30  85
2  79  72  72  24  55  95
3  82   9   9  43  16  67
4  10  16  50  70  65  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98  6 26 43 64 76]
 [10 41  4 42 30 85]
 [79 72 72 24 55 95]
 [82  9  9 43 16 67]
 [10 16 50 70 65 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to allocate in such a way that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98   6  26  43  64  76
1  10  41   4  42  30  85
2  79  72  72  24  55  95
3  82   9   9  43  16  67
4  10  16  50  70  65  13
```

Let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 0 (98). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 5 (85). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 2 (72) and item 5, but item 5 is already taken. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 0, but it's already taken. Assign item 3 (43) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 3, but it's already taken. Assign item 4 (65) to Agent 4.

At this point, all agents except Agent 2 and Agent 3 have one item. Agent 2 and Agent 3 are left without a second item, and item 1 is unallocated. Let's proceed to allocate item 1:

- Since Agent 2 values item 1 as 72 and it's the highest among the remaining unallocated items, we will assign item 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation aims for a balance of envy-freeness, although perfect envy-freeness may not be entirely achievable in every instance due to the discrete nature of items and diverse valuations.

Hereâ€™s the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
