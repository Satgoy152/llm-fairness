Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  47  93  83  17  29
1   5  26  77  46  85  64
2  92  45  33  46  88  36
3  84  68  60  83  61  75
4  50  23  93  44  17  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's valuation of their allocation. Given the table of valuations, we will try to assign items in such a way that each agent feels that they have received a fair share, ideally minimizing envy.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (93), followed by item 3 (83).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (85), followed by item 2 (77).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (92), followed by item 4 (88).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (84), followed by item 3 (83).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most (97), followed by item 2 (93).

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items to the agents such that they have the highest total valuation for their allocations.

1. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This is their highest-valued item, and no other agent values item 2 more than Agent 0 does.
2. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1**: This is their highest-valued item, and it is strategically good to give it to Agent 1 since others have higher preferences elsewhere.
3. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 2**: Although Agent 3 also values item 0 highly, Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0.
4. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 3**: Even though Agent 3 values item 0 highly, item 3 is a suitable alternative for Agent 3.
5. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 4**: This is their highest-valued item, and no other agent values item 5 more than Agent 4 does.
6. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: This item is remaining, and assigning it to Agent 0 increases their total valuation without causing any envy.

After allocation, the distribution is as follows:

- Agent 0: [2, 1]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [5]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and it seeks to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
