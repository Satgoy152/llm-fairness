Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  68  46  95  32  26
1  28  44  85   0  12  96
2  24  47  28  42  73  97
3  26  30  76   6  39  94
4  36  82  44  82  67  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocated bundle as at least as good as any other agent's bundle based on their own valuation. Given the complexity and constraints of the problem, we can use techniques like the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division algorithms, but in this context, we'll aim for a reasonable allocation that balances the agents' preferences based on their valuations.

Firstly, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (95).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (96).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (97).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (94).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (82).

To avoid envy, let's attempt to satisfy the agents' highest preferences as much as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0:** This is their highest valued item.
2. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 1:** This is their highest valued item. Note that both Agent 2 and Agent 3 also highly value item 5, but Agent 1's valuation is slightly higher.
3. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 4:** This is their highest valued item.
4. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 3:** This is their second-highest valued item after item 5.
5. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 2:** This is their third-highest valued item after item 5 and item 1.
6. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 2:** This is a lower valued item, but it complements Agent 2's allocation to ensure they receive items.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the highest preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, with Agent 2 receiving two items to balance the overall allocation. This method aims to reduce envy by satisfying the most valued preferences.
