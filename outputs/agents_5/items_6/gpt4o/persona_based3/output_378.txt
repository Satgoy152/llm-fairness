Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  14  17  78  19  95
1  72  37  85  68   8  49
2  72  21  45  56   5  99
3  90  48  97  72  69  40
4  71  66  99  24  97  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for an envy-free allocation, we should consider the agents' valuations and attempt to minimize envy by ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations matrix, our goal is to distribute all 6 items such that:

1. Every agent gets an integer number of items.
2. The allocation aims to be as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent should ideally prefer their own allocation over others based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations provided:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 7      | 14     | 17     | 78     | 19     | 95     |
| 1     | 72     | 37     | 85     | 68     | 8      | 49     |
| 2     | 72     | 21     | 45     | 56     | 5      | 99     |
| 3     | 90     | 48     | 97     | 72     | 69     | 40     |
| 4     | 71     | 66     | 99     | 24     | 97     | 16     |

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 5 (value 95).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 2 (value 85).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 5, but since agent 0 already has it, we look for the next highest. Item 3 (value 56) is available.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 2, but it is taken by agent 1. The next is item 0 (value 90).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 2 and item 4. Item 2 is taken, so we allocate item 4 (value 97).

Now, let's assign remaining items:

- Items 1 is left unallocated. Assign it to the agent with the lowest total value so far. 

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's preference for the items they receive while ensuring each item is allocated.
