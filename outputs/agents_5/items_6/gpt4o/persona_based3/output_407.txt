Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  31  54  72  44   7
1  84  43  43   2  42  44
2  14  20  26  35   4  87
3  16  50  63  87  72  91
4  86  30  17  20   3  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent is reasonably satisfied with their allocation based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Consider Agent Preferences**: Evaluate the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. **Initial Allocations**: Start by assigning the highest-valued item for each agent, if possible, without creating envy.
3. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**: If an allocation causes envy, try to swap items to minimize or eliminate envy.
4. **Ensure Completeness**: Ensure that all items are allocated and no agent is left out of the allocation process.

Let's perform the allocations based on the provided valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 0 and 3 the most, each at 72.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 84.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most at 87.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most at 91.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most at 86.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (valued at 84).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (valued at 87).
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (valued at 87).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (valued at 30).
5. Agent 0 can take item 4 (valued at 44).
6. Finally, assign item 2 to Agent 3 (valued at 63).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation meets the requirements of distributing all 6 items with each agent getting at least one item, aiming for minimal envy given the constraints.
