Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60   7  73  30  68  42
1  43  74  37  79  84  88
2   5  50  59  16  77  92
3  42  54  56  93  75  88
4  49  76  93  17  96  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close as possible while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the constraints, we will try to distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible based on the provided valuations.

Let's consider the sum of valuations for each agent and try to allocate items to balance these sums. We can begin by assigning each agent the item they value the most, if possible, and then adjust to ensure all items are allocated.

Here are the highest valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: Item 2 (73)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (88)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (92)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (93)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (96)

We can start by assigning these items to the respective agents and adjust the allocation to ensure each item is only assigned to one agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to distribute items 0 and 1 to the agents:

- Agent 0: Currently has item 2.
- Agent 1: Currently has item 5.
- Agent 2: Could be assigned item 0.
- Agent 3: Currently has item 3.
- Agent 4: Currently has item 4.

Since item 1 has the highest valuation for Agent 1 and no conflict with other agents, we can assign item 1 to Agent 1.

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 2: Item [0]
- Agent 3: Item [3]
- Agent 4: Item [4]

The final allocation is as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation is designed to balance the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
