Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  88   4  97  11  72
1  99  87  35  67  63  83
2  91  19  33  37  91  70
3  88  82  86  41  22  78
4  13  25  75   8  48  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use algorithms like the adjusted winner procedure, or more commonly, the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) criterion, which aims to maximize the product of the utilities of all agents. However, given the constraints of integer allocations and the specific valuations provided, we'll aim for a simple solution that tries to balance the allocations based on the agents' valuations.

Here's a possible allocation plan:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 and 3 highly (97 each). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as their second highest valued item (67).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 highly (91). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 5 to Agent 3, since it values it relatively high (78).
5. **Agent 4**: The remaining items are 1 and 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 4, as it has the highest value for it (75).
6. **Agent 0 or 1**: Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it (88) higher than the remaining agents.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction for at least one item, while ensuring no agent is left with zero items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item. This solution is not strictly envy-free but aims to minimize envy by giving each agent one of their more valued items.
