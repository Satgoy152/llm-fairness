Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  31  72  71  43  96
1   4  97  71  87  51  16
2  74  34  40  94  69  66
3  22  66  94  98   2  57
4  36  64  20   1  58  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the round-robin algorithm, where agents pick their most valued item one by one in sequence. Since we are dealing with integer allocations, we can continue this process until all items are distributed. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy among agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Round 1**:
    - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 96).
    - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 97).
    - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 94).
    - Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 98), but since it's taken, agent 3 picks item 2 (value 94).
    - Agent 4 picks item 5 (value 78), but since it's taken, agent 4 picks item 4 (value 58).

2. **Round 2**:
    - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 71).
    - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 87), but since it's taken, agent 1 picks item 2 (value 71).
    - Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 74).
    - Agent 3 picks item 1 (value 66), but since it's taken, agent 3 picks item 0 (value 22).
    - Agent 4 picks item 1 (value 64), but since it's taken, agent 4 picks item 0 (value 36).
  
3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 has items 5 and 3.
   - Agent 1 has item 1.
   - Agent 2 has items 3 and 0.
   - Agent 3 has item 2.
   - Agent 4 has item 4.

Now let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
