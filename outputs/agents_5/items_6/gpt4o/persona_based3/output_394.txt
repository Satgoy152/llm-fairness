Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  26  55  18  44  60
1   7  19  26  81  65  53
2  18  80  36   8  46  78
3  50  53  37  73  42  71
4  49  31  16   4  32  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy. This means each agent should feel they received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  26  55  18  44  60
1   7  19  26  81  65  53
2  18  80  36   8  46  78
3  50  53  37  73  42  71
4  49  31  16   4  32  26
```

We analyze the potential allocations by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring that items are distributed in a way that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest.
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the most, but since it's already allocated to agent 0, item 4 is the next best option.

By allocating each agent their highest-valued available item and ensuring no overlaps, we can proceed as follows:

- Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- Allocate item 5 to agent 3.
- Allocate item 4 to agent 4.

The remaining item is 2. Based on the highest remaining value for item 2:

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 55, which is the highest among those who haven't received a second item.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item while minimizing envy given the constraints.
