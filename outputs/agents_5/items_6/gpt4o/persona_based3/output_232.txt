Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  83  75  43  96  31
1  70  47  98  38  90   9
2  24  44   1  85  47  59
3  31  81  95  42  48  59
4  25  46  58  77  56   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents such that the allocation is fair and preferably envy-free. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Given the matrix of valuations, we can follow a strategy to ensure a fair distribution:

1. Start by looking for items where an agent has a significantly higher valuation than others.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, to distribute the items more fairly.
3. Check the total valuation for each agent after an initial allocation and adjust if necessary to minimize envy.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest (95). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest, but Agent 3 has the second highest valuation (81) and Agent 0 has already been allocated an item. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest (98). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the highest (85). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the highest, but Agent 1 has the second highest valuation (90) and Agent 1 has already been allocated an item. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it at 59, equal to Agent 3, but since Agent 2 only has one item, allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that the high-value items are distributed to agents who value them most, while considering the allocation of items to different agents to maximize fairness.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": []
}
```
