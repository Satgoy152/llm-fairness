Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  99  22  74  10   2
1  63  83  74  79  92  73
2  59   4  44  74  98  96
3  26  29  24  41  59  10
4  35  21  96  62  72   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, not all agents will receive the same number of items, but we will try to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy.

### Summary of Valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Values items highest at 1 (99) and 3 (74).
- **Agent 1**: Values items highest at 4 (92) and 1 (83).
- **Agent 2**: Values items highest at 4 (98) and 5 (96).
- **Agent 3**: Values items highest at 4 (59) and 3 (41).
- **Agent 4**: Values items highest at 2 (96) and 4 (72).

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **High-value items**: Start by allocating the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most.
2. **Balancing**: Ensure each agent receives at least one item or is compensated with high-value items.
3. **Remaining items**: Allocate remaining items to balance the envy among agents.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 1 (99)**: Highest value for Agent 0.
2. **Item 4 (98)**: Highest value for Agent 2.
3. **Item 2 (96)**: Highest value for Agent 4.
4. **Item 3 (79)**: Second-highest value for Agent 1.
5. **Item 5 (73)**: High value for Agent 1.
6. **Item 0 (63)**: Assign to Agent 3 to balance their allocation.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation strategy aims to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items they highly value, while also distributing the items such that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged.
