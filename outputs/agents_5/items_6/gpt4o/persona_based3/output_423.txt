Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  95  18  29  81   5
1  65  86  78  48  26  92
2  38  44  68  58  54  52
3  26  25  86  96  70  64
4  31  40  14  22  53  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we'll use a fair division method that aims to ensure each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations. One approach is to use the method of "envy-freeness," which seeks to distribute items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [55, 95, 18, 29, 81,  5]
Agent 1: [65, 86, 78, 48, 26, 92]
Agent 2: [38, 44, 68, 58, 54, 52]
Agent 3: [26, 25, 86, 96, 70, 64]
Agent 4: [31, 40, 14, 22, 53, 53]
```

One possible approach is to assign items starting with the agent who values an item the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (65).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (95).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (86).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (96).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (81).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (92).

We must ensure that each agent gets at least one item, considering there are only 5 agents and 6 items. Adjust the allocation to provide a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Receives items 1 and 4.
- **Agent 1**: Receives items 0 and 5.
- **Agent 2**: Receives no items in the initial allocation, but let's adjust.
- **Agent 3**: Receives item 2.
- **Agent 4**: Receives no items in the initial allocation, but let's adjust.

Re-evaluating for fairness:

- Reallocate item 3 from Agent 3 to Agent 2 to ensure every agent receives at least one item.

Final allocations considering adjustments:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, except Agent 4, due to there being only 6 items available for 5 agents. However, the goal of fair division is partially met, with minimal envy based on the highest valuations.
