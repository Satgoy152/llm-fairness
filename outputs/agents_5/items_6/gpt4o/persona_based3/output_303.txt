Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  95  32  87  67   5
1  47  62  76  54  22  86
2  34  33  41  21   9  57
3  50  24  75   7  55  41
4  55  41  41  14  32  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total utility each agent receives based on their valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3. We can give agent 0 items 0 and 1, which are their highest valued.

2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the most, so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the most, but since it's already allocated, we look at their next highest valued items. Item 2 is a good choice for agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the most, but it's allocated to agent 2. The next highest value is item 4, so we assign item 4 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The remaining unallocated item is item 3, which is not highly valued by any agent but is a reasonable allocation for agent 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuations to the extent possible, while also adhering to the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
