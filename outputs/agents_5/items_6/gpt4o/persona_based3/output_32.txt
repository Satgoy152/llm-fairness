Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  87   4  30  70   6
1  96  27  95  48   5   2
2  96  79  50  97  19  63
3  55  57  48  43  90  37
4  16  19  23  88  58  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation to their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer items and different valuations can be challenging. We'll try to balance the total value received by each agent.

### Valuation Matrix:
```
Agent \ Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5
--------------------------------------
       0     |  42  87   4  30  70   6
       1     |  96  27  95  48   5   2
       2     |  96  79  50  97  19  63
       3     |  55  57  48  43  90  37
       4     |  16  19  23  88  58  18
```

### Steps to Allocate:
1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:** Allocate items based on which agent values them the most, while trying to balance the total value for each agent.
2. **Check for Envy-Free Possibility:** Adjust allocations to minimize envy by considering the overall value each agent receives.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0** gets item 1 (valued highest by them among unallocated items).
- **Agent 1** gets item 2 (highest value for this agent).
- **Agent 2** gets item 3 (highest value for this agent).
- **Agent 3** gets item 4 (highest value for this agent).
- **Agent 4** gets item 5 (next available item).
- **Agent 1** also gets item 0 (to balance out the values, given remaining items).

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution follows a strategy to balance the total valuations as evenly as possible among the agents. This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items that they value highly or that others do not value significantly more.
