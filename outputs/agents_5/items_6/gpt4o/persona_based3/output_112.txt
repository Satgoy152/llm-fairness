Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  56  49  14  30  62
1  89  64   8  75  72  88
2  82  79  19  87  42  17
3  50  60   4  81  44  43
4  82  99  16  92  88  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the five agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation, if possible. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in all scenarios, we'll focus on providing a reasonable and balanced allocation based on the given values.

Here is a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 highly (62).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highly (89).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 highly (87).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 highly (81), but it's already allocated to Agent 2.
   - Agent 4 values item 1 highly (99).

2. **Allocate High-Value Items First:**
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items 2 and 4 are left.
   - Agent 3 has not received any high-value item, so allocate item 2 to Agent 3 (value 4).
   - Agent 0 can receive item 4, which has a reasonable value for them (30), and it does not create envy since they have the high-value item 5.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 5 and 4
   - Agent 1: Item 0
   - Agent 2: Item 3
   - Agent 3: Item 2
   - Agent 4: Item 1

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value preferences of each agent, given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
