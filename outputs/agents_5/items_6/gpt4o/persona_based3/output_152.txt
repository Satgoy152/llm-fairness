Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  99  24  71  48  51
1  17   6  84  50   0  80
2  75  64  96  90  23  85
3  80   2  30  60  92   2
4   7  52  88  89  31   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to assign the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly relative to others, and no agent feels envious of another's allocation based on their own valuations. Given this setup, we will attempt to allocate the items to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation, striving for envy-freeness where possible.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [50, 99, 24, 71, 48, 51]
- Agent 1: [17, 6, 84, 50, 0, 80]
- Agent 2: [75, 64, 96, 90, 23, 85]
- Agent 3: [80, 2, 30, 60, 92, 2]
- Agent 4: [7, 52, 88, 89, 31, 7]

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value by Agent 0 (99), allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value by Agent 2 (96), allocate to Agent 2.

3. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value by Agent 2 (90), already allocated an item, next highest by Agent 4 (89), allocate to Agent 4.

4. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value by Agent 3 (92), allocate to Agent 3.

5. **Item 5**:
   - Highest value by Agent 1 (80), allocate to Agent 1.

6. **Item 0**:
   - Highest value by Agent 3 (80), already allocated an item, next highest by Agent 2 (75), already allocated an item, next highest by Agent 0 (50), allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 0]
- Agent 1 gets item [5]
- Agent 2 gets item [2]
- Agent 3 gets item [4]
- Agent 4 gets item [3]

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
