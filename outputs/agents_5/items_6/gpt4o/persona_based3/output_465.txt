Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  45   5  84  43  17
1  86  37  48  78  28  15
2  58  44  23  59  18  76
3  93  23  59  42  41  27
4  49  69  23  70  84  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, I will use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility, a common approach to achieving fairness. This approach tries to ensure that the agent with the least total value still receives a reasonable allocation. 

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would have if they received each item one by one and attempt to balance these as evenly as possible:

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [28, 45, 5, 84, 43, 17]
- Agent 1: [86, 37, 48, 78, 28, 15]
- Agent 2: [58, 44, 23, 59, 18, 76]
- Agent 3: [93, 23, 59, 42, 41, 27]
- Agent 4: [49, 69, 23, 70, 84, 64]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Prioritize giving each agent at least one item they highly value.
2. Ensure no agent is significantly disadvantaged compared to others.
3. After each allocation, re-calculate the remaining valuations and choose the next most balanced distribution.

### Allocation Process:
1. Start by allocating the highest-valued item to each agent.
2. Continue allocating remaining items by choosing the item that brings the current lowest total valuation agent closer to the others.

### Steps:
- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (value 84).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (value 86).
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (value 76).
- Agent 3 highly values item 0 (value 93) but it's taken, so item 2 (value 59).
- Agent 4 highly values item 4 (value 84).

With the highest values allocated, re-evaluate the remaining items and distribute to balance the total valuations:

- Agent 3 can take item 1 (value 23).
- Agent 4 can take item 5 (value 64).

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and it attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives. The goal is to avoid significant envy among agents by maximizing their minimum utility.
