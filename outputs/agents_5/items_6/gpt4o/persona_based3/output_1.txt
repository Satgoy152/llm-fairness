Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  17  46  73  61  75
1  35  38  37   7  56   3
2   3  47  45  32  16   1
3  79  52  71  56  56  41
4  90  49  87  39  86  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation if possible, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Here, we have 5 agents and 6 items, which means one agent will get 2 items and the others will get 1 item each. We will try to consider each agent's preferences to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 highly at 89, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 highly at 56, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 highly at 47, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 highly at 71, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 at 90 but it's already taken. The next highest value is item 2 at 87, but it's also taken. We allocate item 5 to Agent 4 as it's their third-highest value at 45.

Now, we have allocated 5 items and need to allocate one more item. Looking at the remaining unallocated items, item 3 is left.

Since Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 at 73 among those who have not received their second item, we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

The final allocations are as follows:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the agents' preferences and provides a fair distribution of items.
