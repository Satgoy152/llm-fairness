Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  94  15  64  43  99
1  27   1  42  68   9  47
2  35  79  15  99  17  28
3  70  23  73  91  40  60
4  76  91  43   3  71  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations in a way that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation Strategy

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We have 5 agents and 6 items to allocate.
   - Each agent should ideally receive 1 to 2 items, as we have more items than agents.
   - We will aim for an allocation where each agent's total valuation of their received items is as high as possible relative to the other agents to reduce envy.

2. **Allocation Process:**
   - **Agent 0:** 
     - Highest valued items: 5 (99), 1 (94)
     - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   
   - **Agent 1:** 
     - Highest valued items: 3 (68), 2 (42)
     - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

   - **Agent 2:** 
     - Highest valued items: 3 (99), 1 (79)
     - Since item 3 is taken, allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
   
   - **Agent 3:** 
     - Highest valued items: 3 (91), 2 (73)
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
   
   - **Agent 4:** 
     - Highest valued items: 1 (91), 0 (76)
     - Since item 1 is taken, allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 4 is left unallocated.
   - Allocate item 4 to any agent who has received fewer items or to balance the overall valuation.

4. **Final Allocations:**

- We will allocate item 4 to Agent 4 since they have only received one item, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on each agent's valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.
