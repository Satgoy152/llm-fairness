Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  25  17  35  56  36
1  30  33  90  86  61  89
2  61  95  48  51  20  66
3  45  45  49  40  20  96
4  61  43  22  53   9  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use algorithms like the "Envy-Free Allocation" or "Proportional Allocation." However, since we need a manual allocation based on the given data, we will strive to achieve a balance where agents receive items they value highly, while also considering the overall distribution of value.

Let's start by looking at the valuations and trying to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 0 the most (95).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values item 2 the most (90) and item 5 the second most (89).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values item 1 the most (95).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values item 5 the most (96).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Values item 3 the most (53).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. We need to allocate item 4, which has not been assigned yet.

6. **Unallocated Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 has already been allocated a highly valued item (item 2).
   - Agent 0 values item 4 (56) reasonably well and has only one item so far.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

The final allocation of items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest or second-highest preferences where possible while ensuring that all items are distributed fairly among the agents.
