Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  26  97  77  13  57
1  69  43  91  77  95  15
2  63  18  36  31   2  42
3  12  30  39  41  70  69
4   1  94  26  36  79   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible, or at least a proportional allocation where each agent feels they receive at least their fair share based on their valuations. This problem does not have a unique solution, but we can attempt to distribute the items in a way that seems most equitable given the valuations.

Here's one approach to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Identify preferences:** Determine which items each agent values most.
2. **Prioritize high-value items:** Try to allocate items that are most valued by an agent if possible, especially if it provides a significant utility gain without causing disproportionate envy among others.
3. **Balance total allocated value:** Ensure that the total value of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

**Valuations Table:**
```
  0   1   2   3   4   5
0: 3  26  97  77  13  57
1: 69 43  91  77  95  15
2: 63 18  36  31   2  42
3: 12 30  39  41  70  69
4: 1  94  26  36  79   3
```

**Allocation Strategy:**
- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (97), so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (95), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (63), so allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (69), so allocate item 5 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most (94), so allocate item 1 to agent 4.
- The remaining item 3 has a relatively balanced valuation among the agents; allocate it to agent 3, who values it second-highest at 41 after item 5.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item they value significantly, and the remaining items are distributed to maintain a balance in perceived fairness based on their valuations.
