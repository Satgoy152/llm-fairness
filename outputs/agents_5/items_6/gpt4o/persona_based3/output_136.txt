Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43   6  85  37   6  38
1  37  38  29  14  95  75
2  34  33  99  23  72  66
3  99   4  25  16  23   6
4  44  51  77  49  86  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and attempt to minimize envy among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. Let's try to allocate items such that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, while also ensuring that all items are distributed.

One common approach to achieving envy-freeness is to apply the "envy-free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, where each agent should not envy another agent's allocation once any single item is removed from that other agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items:

- Start by assigning each agent the item they most highly value, if possible.
- Adjust and reassign items to ensure each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items is correct.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 highly (85).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 highly (95).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 highly, but it's taken. Next highest is item 5 (66).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 highly (99).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 highly, but it's taken. Next highest is item 4 (86).

Now, let's finalize the allocation by ensuring all items are distributed:

- After initial allocation, items 1 and 3 are unassigned.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 and item 3 to Agent 0.

The final allocation can be expressed in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' preferences and distribute all items while considering each agent's highest valuation.
