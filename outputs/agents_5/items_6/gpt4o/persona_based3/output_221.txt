Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  63  23  51  46  98
1  95  79  18  76  64  62
2  91  57   9   5  51  88
3  21  54  84  27  61  88
4  58  13  56  64  67  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. Envy-freeness is a property of allocations where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

The total number of items is 6, and there are 5 agents. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items combined.
2. Use these valuations to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy.

Below, I provide an allocation that attempts to balance the values and minimize envy:

- Agent 0 has relatively high values for items 5, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 values item 0 and 5 quite highly.
- Agent 3 has high value for item 2 and 5.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly.

Based on these observations, we can create an allocation as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives an item (or items) they value significantly, and attempts to maintain balance and minimize envy.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```
