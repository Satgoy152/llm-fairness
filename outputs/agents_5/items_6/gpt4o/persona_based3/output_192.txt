Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  75  58  64  69  27
1  79  92  89  97  74  61
2  34  92  16  32  50  85
3   7  16   4  52  41  62
4  24  87  72  18  92   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to satisfy the conditions of envy-freeness as much as possible. However, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and the total number of items is fixed, perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that attempts to assign items based on maximizing valuations and minimizing envy.

Here is a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (95).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (97).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (85).
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (62).
   - Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (92).

2. **Assign High-Value Items**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as their next highest is item 5 and it is not yet assigned.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as it is their highest value and hasn't been assigned.
   - Item 1 is now left: 
     - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest after item 5 (92). However, Agent 2 already has an item.
     - Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it gives them a high value (92) and maintains balance.

4. **Assign Last Item for Balance**:
   - Item 2 remains unallocated.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4, as this maintains the balance in terms of the number of items each agent receives.

Based on this allocation strategy, each agent should receive the following items:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
This allocation attempts to balance the number of items and optimize the valuations for each agent as much as possible within the constraints.
