Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4   7  39  29  50  51
1  53  37   0  64  98  26
2  76  25  20  84  13  48
3  32  90  39  88   7  54
4  28  95  73  34  26   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations provided, let's attempt to distribute the items while considering these valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Identify Key Valuations**: Start by identifying high-value items for each agent to minimize potential envy.
2. **Assign High-Value Items**: Prioritize the assignment of items that have significant value to particular agents.

#### Analysis:
- **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 5 (51).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (98).
- **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (76).
- **Agent 3** highly values item 1 (90).
- **Agent 4** highly values item 1 (95), but Agent 3's value is also high, so we balance it by considering other allocations.

#### Allocations:
- Assign **item 5** to **Agent 0** because it is their highest valued item.
- Assign **item 4** to **Agent 1** because it is their highest valued item.
- Assign **item 0** to **Agent 2** because it is their highest valued item.
- Assign **item 3** to **Agent 3** because it is their second-highest valued item and avoids conflict on item 1.
- Assign **item 1** to **Agent 4** even though it's a conflict item, it's the highest valued item for them.

Now, we have one item left (item 2), which is somewhat low-valued across all agents:
- Assign **item 2** to **Agent 3** because it balances the allocation and minimizes envy given the current distribution.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their own items while maintaining an equitable distribution given the constraints.
