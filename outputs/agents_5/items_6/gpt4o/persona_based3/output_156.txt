Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95   0  81   2  57  95
1  90  49  39  26  77  35
2  59  86  30  49  89  26
3  22  86  43  65  22  57
4  66  94  60   4  90  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation, given their valuations.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items per Agent:** First, identify which items each agent values the most.
2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:** Allocate items based on which agent values them the most, ensuring each item is assigned to someone who values it highly.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Check if any agent would prefer another agent's allocation based on their preferences and adjust allocations to minimize envy.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [95, 0, 81, 2, 57, 95]
Agent 1: [90, 49, 39, 26, 77, 35]
Agent 2: [59, 86, 30, 49, 89, 26]
Agent 3: [22, 86, 43, 65, 22, 57]
Agent 4: [66, 94, 60, 4, 90, 94]
```

### Allocation Process

- **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 0 (95), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 4 (94), allocate to Agent 4.
- **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 0 (81), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 3 (65), allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 4 (90), allocate to Agent 4.
- **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 0 (95), allocate to Agent 0.

### Resulting Allocation

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets no items.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets items 1 and 4.

This allocation respects the high valuations and tries to minimize envy where possible. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This configuration ensures all items are allocated, and attempts to minimize overall envy among agents while respecting individual preferences.
