Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  68  54  65  73  30
1  97  27  62  67  65  37
2   9  49  91  10  42  79
3  20  17  61  86   2  29
4  89  51  15   8  27  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other agent's allocation, given their individual valuations.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum the values each agent assigns to all items.
2. **Prioritize Allocations**: Start by allocating items that are valued significantly higher by one agent compared to others.
3. **Iterate and Allocate**: Distribute items iteratively, ensuring each agent receives items they value relatively highly.
4. **Check for Envy-Free Allocation**: Adjust allocations if necessary to minimize envy among agents.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 highly (73). Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 highly (97). Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 highly (91). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly (86). Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 highly (70). Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, all items except item 1 have been allocated. To decide item 1's allocation, we can consider remaining valuations:

- **Agent 0**: 68
- **Agent 1**: 27
- **Agent 2**: 49
- **Agent 3**: 17
- **Agent 4**: 51

Agent 4 values item 1 the highest among those unallocated. Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
