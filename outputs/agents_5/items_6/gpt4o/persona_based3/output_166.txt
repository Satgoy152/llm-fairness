Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  23  94  60  56  95
1   5  91  81  98  34  64
2  55  44   5  46  65  27
3  36  12  64  48  16  23
4  32  67   4   6  87  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we can use a commonly used method known as the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" method. This method involves each agent taking turns picking their most valued remaining item. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is item 5 (value 95).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is item 3 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is item 4 (value 65).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value is item 2 (value 64).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value is item 4 (value 87), but since it's taken, next highest is item 5 (value 86).

Now that each agent has picked one item, we repeat the process for the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0:** Next highest value is item 2 (value 94).
7. **Agent 1:** Next highest value is item 1 (value 91). 
8. **Agent 3:** Next highest value is item 0 (value 36).
9. **Agent 2:** Next highest value is item 0 (value 55), but since it's taken, next is item 1 (value 44).

Now, all items have been allocated. Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one of their more preferred items and attempts to balance the valuations each agent receives. If further fairness or envy-freeness is required, adjustments or more sophisticated methods might be needed.
