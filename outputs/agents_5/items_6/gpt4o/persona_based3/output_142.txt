Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  31   8  18  28  38
1  44  80  53  40   5  10
2  34  33  18  50  48  82
3  69  45  28  82  59  92
4  19  77  42  60  87  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that considers their valuations and aims for envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's one way to allocate the items using a simple greedy algorithm:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (95)
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (80)
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 5 (82)
   - Assign item 5 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: Item 3 (82)
   - Assign item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value: Item 4 (87)
   - Assign item 4 to agent 4.

After these initial allocations based on the highest values, we're left with item 2 unallocated. To allocate the remaining item, we can consider the next highest value for this item among all agents who haven't received their top choice:

- **Item 2**: Highest value by agent 1 (53)

Since agent 1 already has an item, we look for who values it the next highest:
- Agent 3 values item 2 at 28, which is the next highest value.

Thus, we assign item 2 to agent 3.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on each agent's highest valuation while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item if possible, and no more than one agent ends up with more than one item.
