Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  31   2  27  30  67
1  64  95  27  64  60  71
2  32   8  25  31  30   4
3   7  85  63  82  14  86
4  65  56   7  78  78   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations, we should aim for an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should prefer their allocated set of items over any other agent's set, or at least be indifferent.

Given the matrix of valuations, one approach is to use an algorithm like the adjusted winner procedure or optimize based on ensuring no agent envies another. However, in this simplified case, we can attempt a manual allocation to balance the valuations and preferences.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 highly (67) and item 0 (62). Assigning these to Agent 0 maximizes his valuation.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1 (95). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively low valuations overall, but let's try to assign them item 2 (25).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (82) and item 5 (86). However, item 5 is already taken, so let's assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 (78). Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

This allocation is not entirely envy-free, but it maximizes individual high valuations where possible. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item.
