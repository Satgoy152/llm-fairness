Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  90  82  16  20  24
1  32  27  68  67  86  50
2  43  31  54  29  11  41
3  99  13  72  72  78  90
4  86   6  42  28   6  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent receives a bundle of items they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given the constraints and the need for each agent to receive an integer number of items, we'll use a heuristic approach to achieve a fair distribution.

First, let's examine the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  90  82  16  20  24
1  32  27  68  67  86  50
2  43  31  54  29  11  41
3  99  13  72  72  78  90
4  86   6  42  28   6  96
```

We need to consider allocations that maximize utility for each agent while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. Given the preferences, we can allocate items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 0, 1, and 2, but these high-value items need to be distributed fairly. Thus, we assign item 1 (90) to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 4 (86), so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for agent 2 is item 0 (43), so we assign item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 (99) but it's already allocated. The next highest value item is 3 or 5. We assign item 3 (72) to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 5 (96), so we allocate item 5 to agent 4.

Now, the remaining item is 2. We'll assign it to the agent who values it next best among those who haven't received their second-highest value item. Agent 3 values item 2 at 72, so we assign item 2 to agent 3.

The proposed allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly, reducing the likelihood of envy.
