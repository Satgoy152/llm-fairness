Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  23  51  67  34  13
1   9  99  89  19  13  82
2  77  13  60  90  73  77
3  82  28  76  17  15  25
4  85  75  59  91  79  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to minimize envy, we can use a method that considers the agents' valuations for each item. One approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" allocation, where each agent receives items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation more than their own. However, given that we have integer allocations and only 6 items, achieving perfect envy-freeness might be impossible. Instead, we aim for a reasonable allocation that considers each agent's preferences.

Let's analyze the table and try to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Prefers item 3 (67) the most, followed by item 2 (51).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prefers item 1 (99) the most, followed by item 2 (89).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Prefers item 3 (90) the most, followed by item 0 (77).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Prefers item 0 (82) the most, followed by item 2 (76).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Prefers item 3 (91) the most, followed by item 0 (85).

Given the above preferences, let's proceed with an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 2
- **Agent 4**: Item 0, Item 4

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's highest preference and ensures that all 6 items are distributed. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, although perfect envy-freeness is not guaranteed due to the integer nature of allocations and limited items.
