Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  36   5  26  81  39
1  85  78  60  90  43  71
2  99  50  17  45  88  56
3  26  45  42  34  14  52
4  29  72  70  83  82  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to find an allocation where no agent envies another agent's allocation. We have 5 agents and 6 items, and we want to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

Given the valuations, the goal is to allocate the items such that each agent has a fair share of the total value of the items they receive according to their preferences.

Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 45 + 36 + 5 + 26 + 81 + 39 = 232
   - Agent 1: 85 + 78 + 60 + 90 + 43 + 71 = 427
   - Agent 2: 99 + 50 + 17 + 45 + 88 + 56 = 355
   - Agent 3: 26 + 45 + 42 + 34 + 14 + 52 = 213
   - Agent 4: 29 + 72 + 70 + 83 + 82 + 31 = 367

2. Allocate items:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (81). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3 (90). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 0 (99). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 has relatively balanced values. Assign item 5 (52) to Agent 3, which is their highest valued.
   - Agent 4 highly values item 3 (83), but since it's assigned, we assign item 2 (70) to Agent 4.

3. Distribute remaining items:
   - Items 1 and 2 have not been assigned. Item 1 is valued highly by Agent 1 (78) and also by Agent 4 (72). Since Agent 1 and 4 both have one item each, assign item 1 to Agent 4 to balance the allocation.
   - Finally, item 2 is valued highest by Agent 4 (70), but since Agent 4 already has two items, assign it to Agent 3 who values it at 42.

Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring fairness.
