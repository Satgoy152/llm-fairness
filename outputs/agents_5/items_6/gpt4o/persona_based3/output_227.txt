Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  96  57  97  13  29
1  25  49  80  88  74  59
2  63  23  45  16  35  98
3  42  34  47  59  78  97
4  98  99  23  30  62  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle they value, ideally minimizing envy among agents. 

Let's analyze and allocate the items step by step:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: Determine which items have the highest valuation for each agent.

2. **Prioritize allocation based on highest value**: Begin by allocating the items that have the highest unique valuation for a single agent. If two or more agents highly value an item, we need to consider overall fairness and balance.

3. **Iterate and adjust**: Adjust based on remaining items and agents' valuations to ensure all items are allocated in a manner that maximizes fairness.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Start by assigning items with the highest valuation to each agent if no direct conflicts arise.
- Balance the allocation by ensuring that each agent receives at least one item they value significantly, if possible.

### Detailed Allocation:
- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (97).
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 (80).
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (98).
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly as well, but since agent 2 has a higher value, give agent 3 another high-value item, like item 4 (78).
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 0 (98) and 1 (99), both of which are not the highest for any other agent, so we can allocate item 1 to agent 4.

### Final Allocation:
- Allocate item 0 to agent 1 as a compromise since itâ€™s not highly valued by others and agent 1 has fewer high-value options after allocating item 2 to them.

### Resulting Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, and the distribution of items is as balanced as possible given the agents' valuations.
