Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  46  65   8  68  50
1  45  30  73  39  91  54
2  98  85  76  30  38  70
3  81  91  27  35  35   1
4  49  88  79  82  64  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we'll use principles from fair division, focusing on ensuring that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Given that we have 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will end up with 2 items, while the others will receive 1 each.

We'll look for the allocation based on maximizing each agent's valuation, attempting to balance the envy among them. Here's a potential strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign items to agents, prioritizing allocations that maximize each agent's satisfaction while keeping envy low.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0: Values item 4 the highest, so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1: Values item 4 the highest, but since itâ€™s taken, we allocate item 2, the next highest valued.
- Agent 2: Values item 0 the highest, so allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3: Values item 1 the highest, so allocate item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4: Values item 3 the highest, so allocate item 3 to agent 4.

Now, we have items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 allocated. We need to allocate item 5:

- Agent 2 values item 5 the second highest, among those who still have high value left for unallocated items. Allocate item 5 to agent 2.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the individual satisfaction of each agent while keeping overall envy low.
