Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  24  93  19  47  84
1  50  46  40  93  53  28
2  97  16  98  45  82   8
3   9  41  67  92  10  18
4  66  81  64  94  41  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free (or approximately envy-free) allocation. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

To achieve this, we can use a strategy where we attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation for their assigned items, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt a fair division:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (70), 2 (93), and 5 (84).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 3 (93) and 0 (50).
3. **Agent 2** has extremely high valuations for items 0 (97) and 2 (98).
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 3 (92).
5. **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 1 (81) and 3 (94).

Given these observations, we can try to allocate items to maximize individual agent satisfaction while balancing the overall distribution.

### Allocation Strategy
- **Agent 2** highly values items 0 and 2, so we assign those to Agent 2.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 3, which Agent 4 also values highly. However, to avoid envy, we give item 3 to Agent 4, who has the highest valuation for it.
- **Agent 0** can receive item 5, which they value significantly.
- **Agent 3** can receive item 4, which is not highly valued by others, minimizing potential envy.
- **Agent 4** can take item 1, which they value the highest.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to an agent who values it relatively highly compared to others, thus minimizing envy.

### Final Allocations
Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

In this distribution, each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated, respecting the preferences as much as possible to achieve an approximately envy-free outcome.
