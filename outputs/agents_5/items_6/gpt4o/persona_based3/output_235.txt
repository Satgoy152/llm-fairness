Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  97  12  90  53  68
1  66  77  25   3  83  31
2  20  86  76  31  55  18
3  51  23   4  24  51  36
4   3  13  30  98  12  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received their fair share based on their individual valuations. A common approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Here, we will attempt to divide the items such that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and the allocation minimizes envy. Given that we have 5 agents and 6 items, at least one agent will receive two items.

Let's evaluate the valuations and attempt an allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 (97) highly.
- Agent 1 values item 4 (83) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 2 (76) highly.
- Agent 3 values item 0 (51) highly.
- Agent 4 values item 3 (98) highly.

We can start by assigning each agent their most valued item:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 3.
5. Assign item 3 to agent 4.

Now, all agents have one item each, and we have one more item (item 5) to allocate. We should give this item to the agent who values it most, provided it does not increase overall envy significantly:

- Check the valuations for item 5:
  - Agent 0: 68
  - Agent 1: 31
  - Agent 2: 18
  - Agent 3: 36
  - Agent 4: 50

Agent 0 values item 5 the highest among the remaining agents, so we assign item 5 to agent 0.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation considers individual preferences and attempts to minimize envy by providing each agent with items they value highly.
