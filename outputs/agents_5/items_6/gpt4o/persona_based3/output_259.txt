Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  61  27  41  71  33
1  37  24   5  18  27   8
2  84  77  62  57  55  40
3  45  74  92  77  20  87
4  79  89  25  21  56  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we aim to satisfy the conditions of envy-freeness as much as possible, given that each agent must receive an integer number of items. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's start by considering the valuations provided in the table:

```
Agent \ Item   0   1   2   3   4   5
0             39  61  27  41  71  33
1             37  24   5  18  27   8
2             84  77  62  57  55  40
3             45  74  92  77  20  87
4             79  89  25  21  56  29
```

To achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 very highly (84), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 3** values item 2 very highly (92), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 4** values item 1 highly (89), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
4. For Agent 0, since they value item 4 highly (71), we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 3 also has a high value for item 5 (87), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
6. This leaves item 3, which Agent 2 values at 57, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, ensure all items are allocated, and each agent has received an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [0, 3]
- Agent 3: [2, 5]
- Agent 4: [1]

This allocation respects the agents' valuations as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
