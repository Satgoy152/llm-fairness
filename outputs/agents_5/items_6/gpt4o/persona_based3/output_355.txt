Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  22  47  38  49   1
1   9  14  83  48  17  95
2  68  24  17  75  23   4
3  27  77  75   0  10  71
4  26  87   1  13  69  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for envy-freeness, where ideally, no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. However, achieving strict envy-freeness with integer allocations may not always be possible, so we will aim for a balanced distribution that respects each agent's preferences as much as possible.

Let's evaluate a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has relatively balanced preferences, but values item 4 the most. Let's consider giving them item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 5. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 the highest, so let's allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 1 highly, but it's already taken. The next best is item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items and need to assign one more item. Let's evaluate the remaining unallocated items:

- Items left: 2

Considering the remaining item:
- Agent 0 values item 2 at 47.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 83 (highest among all).
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 17.
- Agent 3 values item 2 at 75.
- Agent 4 values item 2 at 1.

Since Agent 1 values item 2 the highest, it would be fair to allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [5, 2]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [3]

This allocation considers the highest preferences and tries to minimize envy among agents.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
