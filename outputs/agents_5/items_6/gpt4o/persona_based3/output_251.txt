Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  92  40  73  10  95
1  68  91   8  98  61  91
2  52   8  58   6  33  82
3  55  95  60  84  79  13
4  71  69  33  87  52  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  92  40  73  10  95
1  68  91   8  98  61  91
2  52   8  58   6  33  82
3  55  95  60  84  79  13
4  71  69  33  87  52  55
```

We should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation while ensuring no envy among agents. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most.
3. **Agent 2** might prefer item 5 due to its relatively high valuation.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for item 1 and item 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 highly but item 0 is also significant.

A possible fair, envy-free allocation might be:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 5] (valuations 97, 95)
- **Agent 1**: Item [3] (valuation 98)
- **Agent 2**: Item [2] (valuation 58)
- **Agent 3**: Item [1] (valuation 95)
- **Agent 4**: Item [4] (valuation 52)

This way, each agent receives at least one of their higher-valued items, and the allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
