Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  89  94  41  37  87
1  23   9  35  45  56  53
2  49  81   8  80  66  64
3  13  19  43   4  71  32
4  28  90  54  16  71  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to satisfy the principles of envy-freeness as closely as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent to their own allocation. However, since perfect envy-freeness is often hard to achieve, especially with indivisible items, we will try to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives a fair share.

Let's begin by examining the valuations of each item by each agent:

```
Agent 0: [26, 89, 94, 41, 37, 87]
Agent 1: [23, 9, 35, 45, 56, 53]
Agent 2: [49, 81, 8, 80, 66, 64]
Agent 3: [13, 19, 43, 4, 71, 32]
Agent 4: [28, 90, 54, 16, 71, 75]
```

Next, we will attempt to allocate items based on maximizing the total value for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and minimizing overall envy.

### Allocation Plan

- **Agent 0** highly values item 2, so allocate item 2.
- **Agent 1** values item 4 the most, so allocate item 4.
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the most, so allocate item 3.
- **Agent 3** values item 4 the most, but since it's already taken, allocate item 5, the next highest valued item.
- **Agent 4** values item 1 the most, so allocate item 1.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and one item (item 0) is left. We need to distribute this remaining item to ensure that all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0** has item 2, giving them a valuation of 94.
- **Agent 1** has item 4, giving them 56.
- **Agent 2** has item 3, giving them 80.
- **Agent 3** has item 5, giving them 32.
- **Agent 4** has item 1, giving them 90.

Item 0 has the following valuations:
- **Agent 0**: 26
- **Agent 1**: 23
- **Agent 2**: 49
- **Agent 3**: 13
- **Agent 4**: 28

To minimize envy, allocate item 0 to **Agent 2** (who values it the most among those who do not have higher value items). This gives them items 0 and 3, maximizing their overall valuation.

### Final Allocations

Here are the allocations ensuring all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.
