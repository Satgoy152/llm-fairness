Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  84  64   2  69  30
1  86  42  23  98  67  47
2  51  32  15  86  84  42
3  51  68  22  71  40   3
4  53  44   2  76   2  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that considers each agent's valuation and aims for envy-freeness, we should try to allocate the items such that each agent feels satisfied with their bundle. Given the small size of the problem, we can manually examine possible allocations to see if we can find one that is envy-free, or at least as fair as possible.

Let's start by examining the preferences:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (84), followed by item 4 (69).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (98), followed by item 0 (86).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (86), followed by item 4 (84).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (68), followed by item 3 (71).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most (76), followed by item 0 (53).

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items in a way that tries to respect these preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (84) to Agent 0, as it's their highest valuation item.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3 (98) to Agent 1, their highest valuation item.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4 (84) to Agent 2, as it's their second-highest choice left.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 0 (51) to Agent 3, as item 1 is already taken, and their next best choice is item 0.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 5 (42) to Agent 4, as items 3 and 0 are already taken, and this is one of their next best choices.

We have now allocated 5 items. The remaining item is item 2, which we will allocate to the agent who has a relatively lower overall value of their allocated items compared to others:

6. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (64) to Agent 0. This improves Agent 0's total valuation and reduces potential envy.

The final allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.

Formatting this in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```
