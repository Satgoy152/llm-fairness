Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  19  68  99  65  11
1  95  17  62  74  32  47
2  11  81  34  96  89  89
3  36  90  64  41  50  95
4   1  92  14  26   2  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 5 agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

Here's one possible allocation using the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 2 (68)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (95), Item 3 (74)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (96), Item 4 (89)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (90), Item 5 (95)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (97), Item 1 (92)

Considering these valuations, a possible allocation could be:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their highest value item.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as it is their highest value item.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2, as it is one of their highest value items.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 3, as it is their highest value item.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 4, as it is one of their highest value items.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their next highest value item and ensures they receive more than one item.

Thus, the allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and every agent receives at least one item. It attempts to align with each agent's preferences based on their valuations.
