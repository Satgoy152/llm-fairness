Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  56  27  81  99  35
1  75  24  84   8  59  30
2  62  80  26  12  36  66
3  18  71  29  17  62  21
4  85  17   4  87  34  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation given their valuations. This problem can be complex, but one approach is to use a version of the round-robin or serial dictatorship method, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued remaining item.

Considering the valuations provided, let's perform a round of allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest remaining value is for item 2 (84).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest remaining value is for item 1 (80).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest remaining value is for item 4 (62), but it's taken, so next highest is item 1 (71), which is also taken, so item 0 (18).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest remaining value is for item 3 (87).

Now, we have items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 taken, and item 5 remains.

Continuing the allocation:

6. **Agent 0**: Next highest available item is 0, which is taken, so they take item 5 (35).

Now every agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has their highest possible remaining value at each step, given the constraints of the problem.
