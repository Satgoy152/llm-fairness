Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  25  80  57  79  94
1  11  98  71  48  81  76
2  38  10  66  72  87  59
3  74   5  75  85  85  44
4  65  90  93  50  92  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent to get a sense of their preferences.
2. Try to allocate items such that each agent gets the most value possible, given the constraint of integer items.

Let's consider maximizing the minimum envy-free allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (94) and item 4 (79).
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 (98) and item 4 (81).
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 (87) and item 3 (72).
- Agent 3 highly values item 3 (85) and item 0 (74).
- Agent 4 highly values item 2 (93) and item 1 (90).

Based on these preferences, we can allocate items to agents to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one of their most preferred items, balancing the total valuation each agent receives to minimize envy. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.
