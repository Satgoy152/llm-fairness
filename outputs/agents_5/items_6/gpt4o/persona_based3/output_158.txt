Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  61   9  50  74  54
1  51  89   9  73  85   5
2  83  80  45  68  53  83
3  86  38   8   9  70  95
4   7  87  71  63  93  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we will consider the valuations of each agent for the items, aiming to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

A common approach to achieving fairness is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns selecting their most valued remaining item. Here's a possible allocation that considers each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (74)
   - Allocated Item 4

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 1 (89)
   - Allocated Item 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (83)
   - Allocated Item 0

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value: Item 5 (95)
   - Allocated Item 5

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (93), but it's already taken.
   - Next highest value: Item 3 (63)
   - Allocated Item 3

Returning to the unallocated items, we have Item 2 remaining:

6. **Agent Selection for Remaining Item**:
   - Agent 4 values Item 2 at 71, highest among remaining agents' valuations for unallocated items.
   - Allocated Item 2 to Agent 4

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 2]
}
```

Each agent has received items according to their highest preferences, given the constraints, and all items have been allocated.
