Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  83  97  22  43  71
1  79  90  35   3  92  85
2  96  40  91  63  58  11
3   8   5  31   0  11  91
4  54  88  85  27  83  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraint of integer allocations, we will attempt to match each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring a fair distribution.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Assign items based on highest valuations:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (96).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (90).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (97).
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (63).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (92).
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (71).

2. **Adjust allocations to ensure fairness:**
   - We aim to balance the total value perceived by each agent to avoid envy.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items [2, 5].
   - Agent 1 receives items [1, 4].
   - Agent 2 receives items [0, 3].
   - Agent 3 receives no items.
   - Agent 4 receives no items.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent is allocated items they highly value while maintaining a balance of total perceived value across agents.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [],
    "4": []
}
```
