Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  10  93  99  78  54
1  75  44   7  54   8  67
2  16  48   0  36  36  58
3   0  16  14  27  84  37
4  37  57  79  23  64  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring an envy-free distribution, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to balance the overall satisfaction. The goal of envy-freeness is to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here is one possible allocation that attempts to satisfy these conditions:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly (99) and item 2 (93).
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (75) and item 5 (67).
- Agent 2 has moderate values across the board but values item 5 (58) the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly (84).
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly (79) and item 5 (68).

Based on these observations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Give them item 3 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Give them item 0 (75).
3. **Agent 2**: Give them item 5 (58).
4. **Agent 3**: Give them item 4 (84).
5. **Agent 4**: Give them items 2 (79) and 1 (57).

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one high-value item according to their preferences, and each agent receives exactly one or two items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 1]
}
```

This distribution aims to be envy-free given the constraints of integer allocations and the valuations table provided.
