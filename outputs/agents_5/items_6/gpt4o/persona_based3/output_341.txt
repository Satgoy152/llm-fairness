Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  75  25  36  46  40
1  79  63  88  61  63   8
2  83  42  70  98  59  88
3  33  94   8  38  94  32
4  13  34   7  99  14  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

To address the problem of fairly allocating items among agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation as much as possible, though with integer allocations, true envy-freeness might be challenging. The goal is to allocate all 6 items to 5 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Based on the valuations, a potential strategy is to allocate items to agents who value them the most. Below is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (83). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (94). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (88). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 (99). Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (94), who already has item 1. To avoid giving too many items to one agent, the next highest valuation is by Agent 1 (63). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (88), who already has item 0. The next highest valuation is by Agent 4 (92). Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.
- Agent 3 receives item 1.
- Agent 4 receives items 3 and 5.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```
