Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  94  59  10  60  95
1  95  65  55  21  74  10
2  76  90  88  19   6  79
3  25  52   8  33  25  17
4  50  14  55  12  41  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure a balanced distribution based on the given valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:** Look at each agent's strongest preferences to try and give them at least one of their most valued items.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Start by assigning the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

3. **Balance Remaining Items:** Redistribute or adjust allocations if needed to ensure all items are assigned while trying to maintain fairness and minimize envy.

Given this procedure, here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Has the highest valuation for item 5, so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Has the highest valuation for item 0, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Has the highest valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** With lower valuations, we aim to provide a fair allocation, so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Allocate item 4 to Agent 4, as it is one of their moderately valued items.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, leaving item 2 unallocated. We need to determine the best recipient for this item based on maximizing fairness and reducing envy.

- **Item 2:** The remaining item can be allocated to Agent 2, who has a relatively high valuation for this item compared to other unassigned items.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the valuations across agents and ensure each agent receives items they value, minimizing overall envy.
