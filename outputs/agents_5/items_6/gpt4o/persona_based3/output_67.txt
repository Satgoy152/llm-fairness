Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  44  78  88  28  52
1  44  27  81   4  60  68
2  76  26  79   0   7  45
3  56  84  87  11  30  21
4  49  88   9  51   8  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the items to agents in a way that is fair and minimizes envy. A common approach is to ensure Pareto efficiency and envy-freeness to the extent possible given the constraints (integer allocations and all items must be distributed).

The table of valuations is as follows:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  44  78  88  28  52
1  44  27  81   4  60  68
2  76  26  79   0   7  45
3  56  84  87  11  30  21
4  49  88   9  51   8  94
```

Let's implement a simple algorithm to allocate the items:

1. Each agent ranks the items by their value.
2. We initially assign items to the agent who values them the most and continue to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust assignments to balance overall valuation and minimize envy.

Here's a possible allocation that attempts to balance these goals:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest, so give item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest, so give item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest, so give item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest, so give item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest, so give item 5 to agent 4.
- The remaining item 4 is valued highest by agent 1, so give item 4 to agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item [3]
- Agent 1 gets items [2, 4]
- Agent 2 gets item [0]
- Agent 3 gets item [1]
- Agent 4 gets item [5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
