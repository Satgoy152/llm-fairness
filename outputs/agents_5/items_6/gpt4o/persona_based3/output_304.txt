Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  23  59  35   0  26
1  43  37  49  22  84  46
2  31  43  46  26  95  45
3  87  85  75  48  93  16
4  61  88  46  52  26  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent feels that their share is at least as good as any other agent's share by their own valuation. Given the valuations, a common approach is to use an algorithm like the Envy-Free Matching or a round-robin method while considering the valuations.

Here's a potential allocation that attempts to balance the valuations fairly:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 highly (68) and item 2 (59).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (84) the most.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 (95) the most, but since it's already taken, we look at item 5 (45).
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 (87) the most, but it's already taken, so item 3 (48) is next.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 (88) the most.

With these considerations, here is a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 2]
- **Agent 1**: [4]
- **Agent 2**: [5]
- **Agent 3**: [3]
- **Agent 4**: [1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their own valuations. Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
