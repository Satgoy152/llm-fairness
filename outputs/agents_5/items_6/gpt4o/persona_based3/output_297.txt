Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  47  71  28  63  70
1  39  92  88  99   5  66
2  28  49  96  96   7   3
3  85  74  95  55  41   2
4  51  25  65  48  88   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents while ensuring fairness and attempting to minimize envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value received by any agent. Given the agents' valuations, a reasonable approach is to allocate items to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation. Here's one possible allocation method:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

2. Adjust assignments to ensure fairness by balancing the total value of all allocations if needed.

Let's perform the allocation step-by-step:

- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 3 (value of 85).
- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 1 (value of 92).
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 2 (value of 96).
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 1 (value of 99).
- Item 4 is most valued by Agent 4 (value of 88).
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 0 (value of 70).

After assigning based on highest valuation, we have:
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 0: [5]

We find that each agent has at least one item. This allocation seems fair given the constraints. Thus, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
