Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  59  16  33  88  76
1  12  37  35  80  72  78
2  18  83  26  10  48  68
3  30  91  80   7  52  74
4  20  29  71  90  92   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which balances efficiency and fairness by maximizing the product of the utilities of all agents. Here's a step-by-step allocation using a heuristic approach:

1. **Assign the highest-valued item for each agent preferentially:**

   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (value 88).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (value 80).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (value 83).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (value 91), but item 1 is already taken by Agent 2. Next highest is item 2 (value 80).
   - Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (value 92), but item 4 is already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 3 (value 90), but it is already taken by Agent 1. Next highest is item 2 (value 71), but it is taken by Agent 3. Next attempt is item 0 (value 20).

   After this initial assignment, the items are distributed as follows:
   - Agent 0: [4]
   - Agent 1: [3]
   - Agent 2: [1]
   - Agent 3: [2]
   - Agent 4: [0]

2. **Allocate the remaining items:**

   The remaining items are 5, which needs to be assigned. Check for the next highest available item for each agent:

   - Agent 0 has item 5 valued at 76.
   - Agent 1 has item 5 valued at 78.
   - Agent 2 has item 5 valued at 68.
   - Agent 3 has item 5 valued at 74.
   - Agent 4 has item 5 valued at 5.

   The highest valuation for item 5 is by Agent 1 (value 78).

   Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Final Allocation:**

   After the allocation, each agent has the following items:

   - Agent 0: [4]
   - Agent 1: [3, 5]
   - Agent 2: [1]
   - Agent 3: [2]
   - Agent 4: [0]

This allocation is based on a heuristic approach aiming to balance the individual preferences for a fair distribution. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
