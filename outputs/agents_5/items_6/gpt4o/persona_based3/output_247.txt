Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  98  56  69  63  82
1  68  37  44   9  16  53
2  83  69  55  29  70  51
3  43  43  63  22  86  92
4  11  10  91  79   4   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over theirs. Here’s a step-by-step approach to finding a fair division:

1. **Initial Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [70, 98, 56, 69, 63, 82]
   - Agent 1: [68, 37, 44, 9, 16, 53]
   - Agent 2: [83, 69, 55, 29, 70, 51]
   - Agent 3: [43, 43, 63, 22, 86, 92]
   - Agent 4: [11, 10, 91, 79, 4, 2]

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuation:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as their valuation (83) is the highest.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as their valuation (98) is the highest.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4, as their valuation (91) is the highest.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 4, as their valuation (79) is the highest.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as their valuation (86) is the highest.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as their valuation (92) is the highest.

3. **Ensuring Envy-Freeness:**
   - Check each agent's allocation and ensure no agent envies another’s allocation based on their own valuations.

4. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 1
   - Agent 1: No items
   - Agent 2: Item 0
   - Agent 3: Items 4 and 5
   - Agent 4: Items 2 and 3

5. **JSON Representation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every item is assigned to an agent and attempts to minimize envy among agents based on their valuations.
