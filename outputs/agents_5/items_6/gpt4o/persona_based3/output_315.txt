Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  12  22  25  94  38
1   9  35   5  37  70  85
2  99  69  96  35  48  44
3  35  24  14   8  68  99
4  55  71  87  83  87  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the items in a way that is as fair as possible, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will attempt to follow the principle of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's first briefly analyze the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Highest value is item 4 (value 94).
- Agent 1: Highest value is item 5 (value 85).
- Agent 2: Highest value is item 0 (value 99).
- Agent 3: Highest value is item 5 (value 99).
- Agent 4: Highest value is item 2 (value 87).

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 4 (value 94) to Agent 0. This is their highest valued item.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5 (value 85) to Agent 1. This is their highest valued item.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (value 99) to Agent 2. This is their highest valued item.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 (value 8) to Agent 3, which is not highly valued by others.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2 (value 87) to Agent 4, which is their highest valued item.
6. **Remaining item (1)**: Allocate item 1 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 has received the least value so far.

This allocation balances the distribution of items based on the agents' preferences and attempts to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
