Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  98  31  66  64  58
1  89   0  40  33  30  14
2  60  89  78  50  49   9
3  28  41  21   3   5  73
4  42  91  69  19   8  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we'll aim to distribute them based on the agents' valuations. We will try to maximize each agent's value for the items they receive while ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible.

To achieve this, let's start by analyzing the matrix of valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: [26, 98, 31, 66, 64, 58]
Agent 1: [89, 0, 40, 33, 30, 14]
Agent 2: [60, 89, 78, 50, 49, 9]
Agent 3: [28, 41, 21, 3, 5, 73]
Agent 4: [42, 91, 69, 19, 8, 35]
```

We'll try to allocate items to maximize fairness based on these values:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation of any item at 89 for item 0.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 at 89 (the second-highest single-item valuation).
3. **Agent 0** values item 3 at 66 (after 98 for item 1, but item 1 is already considered for Agent 2).
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 at 73.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 at 91, but since item 1 is already considered for Agent 2, we consider item 2 at 69 for Agent 4.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items considering the above allocations:

- Agent 1: Takes item 0.
- Agent 2: Takes item 1.
- Agent 0: Initially takes item 3.
- Agent 3: Takes item 5.
- Agent 4: Takes item 2.

We'll now check for remaining items and distribute them to ensure all items are allocated:

- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5. Remaining item: 4.

Now we need to ensure everyone gets an integer number of items, and at least 6 items are allocated in total. Let's consider the remaining item 4:

- Agent 0 is currently holding only one item (3) and values item 4 significantly (64). Thus, we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

This gives us the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent gets at least some items, and it's based on maximizing their individual valuations.
