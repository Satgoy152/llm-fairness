Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  75  16  45  26  53
1  82  85   2   3  18  48
2  18  57  12  72  62  71
3  60  41  92  74  62  57
4  36  52   6  78  60  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use an algorithm that seeks to allocate items such that each agent receives items they highly value, while also ensuring no agent envies another's allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Identify the Highest Valued Items:**
   - Start by identifying which items have the highest value for each agent.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Try to allocate these high-value items to the respective agents that value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Balancing the Allocation:**
   - After initial allocations, check if any agent has no items or fewer items and attempt to balance the allocation by re-allocating items that cause the least envy.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - Ensure that all 6 items are allocated, with no item left unallocated, and make sure each agent's total allocation is reasonable compared to others.

### Allocation:

Following this process, here is a possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 (75), so allocate item 1.
- **Agent 1:** The highest value for Agent 1 is item 1 (85), but it is already allocated, so allocate item 0 (82).
- **Agent 2:** Allocate item 5 (71) as it is the highest remaining value for Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Allocate item 2 (92) as it is the highest value for Agent 3.
- **Agent 4:** Allocate item 3 (78) as it is the highest value for Agent 4.

Now, we have items 1, 0, 5, 2, and 3 allocated. We still need to allocate one more item, item 4. 

- **Agent 0 and Agent 1:** Both value item 4 (26 and 18, respectively), but Agent 4 values item 4 at 60, so allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring all items are allocated and attempting to minimize envy.
