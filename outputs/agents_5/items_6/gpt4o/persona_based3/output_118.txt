Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  57  66  41  68  89
1  55  20  37  79  31  38
2   4  63  96  62  73   7
3  91  32   0  12  27  31
4  15   9  99  26  19  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to satisfy criteria such as envy-freeness and equitable distribution based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuations. This is a challenging problem, but one approach is to maximize the minimum satisfaction or utility each agent receives.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy by attempting to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 5 (89) and a moderate valuation for other items.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3 (79) and a moderate valuation for other items.
- Agent 2 values item 2 (96) highly and has moderate valuations for other items.
- Agent 3 values item 0 (91) highly and has moderate valuations for other items.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4 (19) and item 2 (99).

Based on these observations, let's attempt an allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the items are allocated in a way that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations, given the constraints.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items based on individual valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
