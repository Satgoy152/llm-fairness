Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  38  18  46   6   4
1  84  88  27  22  12  16
2   1  15  39  89  97  91
3  75   0  13  49  39  77
4  79   7  76  10  17  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items to agents based on their valuations, we can utilize an algorithm that attempts to minimize envy among agents. One method that can be applied here is the "Envy-Free Allocation" approach, which considers how to distribute items so that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to find a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation per Agent:** Sum up the valuations of all items for each agent. This helps understand each agent's overall valuation scale.

2. **Initial Item Assignment:** Start by assigning items based on each agent's highest valuation to ensure each agent gets their most valued item, promoting satisfaction and reducing envy.

3. **Iterate and Adjust:** Continue assigning remaining items by considering the next highest valuations, ensuring that allocations remain as balanced as possible in terms of total perceived value.

4. **Final Adjustment:** Verify that each agent has either one or zero items, adjusting as necessary to ensure exactly six items are distributed in total.

Let's execute this plan:

**Valuation Matrix:**

| Agent | Total Valuation |
|-------|-----------------|
| 0     | 201             |
| 1     | 249             |
| 2     | 332             |
| 3     | 253             |
| 4     | 237             |

**Initial Allocation Attempt:**

- Agent 0 receives item 0 (value 89).
- Agent 1 receives item 1 (value 88).
- Agent 2 receives item 4 (value 97).
- Agent 3 receives item 5 (value 77).
- Agent 4 receives item 2 (value 76).

**Remaining Item:** Item 3

Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 89). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest individual valuations, while attempting to minimize envy and ensuring all 6 items are allocated.
