Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  80  58  89  74  13
1  22  43  83  95  42  50
2  65  66  50  66  10   5
3  64   6  70  83  24  76
4  58  68  54  63  51  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own allocation. Given the agents' valuations of the items, we aim to distribute the items such that the allocations are as envy-free as possible. This can be challenging due to the discrete nature of the items and the fact that each agent must receive an integer number of items. However, we can attempt to balance the allocations by considering each agent's value for the items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 3. Allocating these items to Agent 0 gives them significant value.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most, but since it's already allocated, we can give them item 2, which they value highly.
3. **Agent 2** does not have particularly high valuations for any item, but item 0 is one of the higher ones. Since item 0 is already allocated, we can give them item 1, which is the next best.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 5. Allocating this item to them would maximize their utility.
5. **Agent 4** can be given item 4, which is their highest-valued item among the remaining options.

Based on this reasoning, a possible allocation that attempts to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible is:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 4

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```
