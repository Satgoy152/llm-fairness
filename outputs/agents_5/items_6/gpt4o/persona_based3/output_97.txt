Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  86  23  12  88  85
1  63  92  10  30   0  49
2  37  21  37  34   9  82
3  39  29  16  71  65  21
4  89  50  24  67  58  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and aim for envy-freeness, if possible, or at least a fair distribution based on their preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach to make the allocation:

1. **List all items and their values for each agent**:
   - Item 0: [13, 63, 37, 39, 89]
   - Item 1: [86, 92, 21, 29, 50]
   - Item 2: [23, 10, 37, 16, 24]
   - Item 3: [12, 30, 34, 71, 67]
   - Item 4: [88, 0, 9, 65, 58]
   - Item 5: [85, 49, 82, 21, 52]

2. **Determine the highest valuation for each item and attempt to allocate it to the corresponding agent**:
   - Item 0: Highest valuation by agent 4 (89)
   - Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 1 (92)
   - Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 2 (37)
   - Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 3 (71)
   - Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 0 (88)
   - Item 5: Highest valuation by agent 2 (82)

3. **Allocate items based on the highest valuation where possible**:
   - Agent 0: Item 4
   - Agent 1: Item 1
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 5
   - Agent 3: Item 3
   - Agent 4: Item 0

4. **Check allocations**: 
   - All items are allocated.
   - Each agent gets at least one item, and no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Given these considerations, the final fair allocation can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, thereby achieving a fair division under the given constraints.
