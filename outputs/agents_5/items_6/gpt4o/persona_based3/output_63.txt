Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  66  87  89  10  47
1   0  82  74  98  29  91
2  46  48  35  22   3  33
3  26  99  70   1   0  81
4   5  30  34  99  76  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and considering each agent's valuation of the items, we will attempt to distribute the items such that no agent envies another's allocation.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest at 89. Letâ€™s allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken. The next highest value for Agent 1 is item 5 at 91. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest at 46. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest at 99. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken. The next highest value for Agent 4 is item 4 at 76. Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining item (item 2):
- Agent 0 values item 2 at 87, the highest among the remaining agents for this item. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [4]

These allocations consider each agent's preferences, aiming to minimize envy by giving each agent their highest-valued available items.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
