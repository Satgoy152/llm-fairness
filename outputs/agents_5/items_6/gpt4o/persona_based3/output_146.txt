Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  21  94  44  20  42
1  32  17  58  90  74  66
2  46  15  16  81  44  39
3   1  83  62  32   4  46
4   8  18  40  37  82  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 21 94 44 20 42]
 [32 17 58 90 74 66]
 [46 15 16 81 44 39]

 [ 8 18 40 37 82 84]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value, ideally minimizing envy among agents. The concept of envy-freeness is a key goal here, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's allocation of items to their own.

Given the valuations:

```
       0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent
0     85  21  94  44  20  42
1     32  17  58  90  74  66
2     46  15  16  81  44  39
3      1  83  62  32   4  46
4      8  18  40  37  82  84
```

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Has the highest valuation for item 2 (94), so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Has the highest valuation for item 3 (90), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 3:** Has the highest valuation for item 1 (83), so allocate item 1 to agent 3.
4. **Agent 4:** Has the highest valuation for item 5 (84), so allocate item 5 to agent 4.
5. **Agent 2:** To ensure fairness, allocate item 0 (46) to agent 2, as agent 2 values it more than item 4 and it is the highest unallocated value.
6. **Agent 4:** Allocate item 4 to agent 4 since they have the highest remaining valuation (82) for it and only have one item so far.

This allocation gives each agent their highest or near-highest valued items, aiming to balance the distribution of total value. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to ensure a fair division based on their valuations.
