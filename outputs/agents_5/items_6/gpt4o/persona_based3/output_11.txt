Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  64  99  89  72  77
1  62  24  29  19  79   9
2  21  69  67  13  91  73
3  50  66  70  28  64  50
4  44  73  76   9  77  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both fairness and envy-freeness. The goal is to ensure each agent receives items in such a way that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

One common method for achieving this is to use the notion of maximizing each agent's minimum satisfaction. This often involves assigning items such that the least happy agent is as happy as possible, a concept known as the "maximin" strategy.

Let's approach the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of items**: There are 6 items to be distributed among 5 agents.

2. **Initial allocation strategy**: We aim to allocate at least 1 item to each agent initially, then distribute any remaining items. We'll focus on maximizing the minimum satisfaction.

3. **Assign items based on preferences**: We'll try to give each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no duplication, and then adjust for any remaining items.

Let's calculate the initial allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the most (99).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the most (79).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the most, but since it's taken, item 5 is next highest (73).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the most (70).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the most, but since it's taken, item 1 is next highest (73).

After the first round:
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.

Items allocated: [2, 4, 5, 3, 1]

Remaining item: 0

Allocate remaining item 0:
- Agent 0 has already been allocated an item. Consider the next agent with the lowest allocation or who can value it decently.

From the remaining choices, allocate item 0 to Agent 4 (as they value item 0 higher than Agent 3).

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1, 0]

In JSON format, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest valuations as much as possible with the constraint of integer item allocation, aiming for envy-freeness given the available items.
