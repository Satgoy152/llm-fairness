Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54   3  67  21   8  32
1  70  91  39  89  58  98
2  53  81  35  33  40  39
3   9  90  65  27  82  12
4  86   7  94  20  48  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to minimize jealousy between agents by giving each agent items they value highly. Let's analyze the valuations to find an allocation that is as fair as possible.

The valuation matrix is:

```
Agent \ Item    0   1   2   3   4   5
0               54   3  67  21   8  32
1               70  91  39  89  58  98
2               53  81  35  33  40  39
3                9  90  65  27  82  12
4               86   7  94  20  48  86
```

An efficient approach would be to look for items that are uniquely highly valued by each agent to start building our allocation. Let's go through a potential allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest valuation is for item 2 (67). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** The highest valuation is for item 1 (91). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** The highest valuation is for item 1 (81), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 5 (39), which is still available. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** The highest valuation is for item 1 (90), but it's already taken. The next highest valuation is item 4 (82). Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:** The highest valuation is for item 2 (94), but it's already taken. The next highest valuation is item 0 (86). Allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items: [2, 1, 5, 4, 0]. One item remains unallocated.

6. Two items are left: item 3 and item 0 (taken by Agent 4). Item 3 has the next highest valuation by Agent 1 (89) after their top choice. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, all items have been allocated. To present the final fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```
