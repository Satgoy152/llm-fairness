Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  11  20   6  59  88
1  49  55  45  23  20  57
2  10  39  84   3  29  94
3  13  13   2  24  78  49
4  26   1   0  43  74  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we want to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the valuations in the table, let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy and ensure a balanced distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 4: Agent 4 values item 5 the most (98), which is the highest valuation for any item by any agent. This allocation reduces potential envy for Agent 4.

2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1: Agent 1 values item 0 the most (49), and this is the highest remaining valuation for item 0.

3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2: Agent 2 values item 1 at 39, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item.

4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0: Agent 0 values item 2 at 20, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item.

5. Assign item 3 to Agent 3: Agent 3 values item 3 at 24, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item.

6. Assign item 4 to Agent 0: Agent 0 values item 4 at 59, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item.

Let's present the allocations in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuation for the items they received, thereby minimizing potential envy.
