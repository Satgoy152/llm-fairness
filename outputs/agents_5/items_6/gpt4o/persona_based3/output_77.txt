Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7   7  51  42  50  70
1   5  21  91   9  93  36
2  12  48  16   4  14  23
3  29  17  83  41  71  31
4  38  39  82   6  23  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, and attempting to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation.

To do this, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify Preferences**: Examine the valuation table to understand the preferences of each agent for each item.
2. **Greedy Allocation**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest value preferences, adjusting to ensure no agent receives all preferred items if it causes significant envy.
3. **Adjustment**: Reallocate if necessary to ensure all agents get at least one item and to reduce any significant envy.

Let's allocate items based on this approach:

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 1** highly values items 2 and 4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 as it has the highest value for them.
2. **Agent 3** values items 2 and 4 highly. Since item 4 is already allocated, allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 0** has a strong preference for item 5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 4** values item 2 highly, which is already allocated. Allocate item 0 as it is the next highest value for Agent 4.
5. **Agent 2** has item 1 as the highest available value. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
6. Allocate the remaining item 3 to the agent with the next highest preference who hasn't reached their maximum allocation, which is Agent 4.

### Final Allocation

Following the above steps, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Items 0, 3

Here's how it looks in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives items that maximize their value while maintaining a balance to reduce envy and provide each agent with at least one item.
