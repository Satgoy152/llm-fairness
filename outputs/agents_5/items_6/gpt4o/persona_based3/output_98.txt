Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  17  29  99   5  60
1  52  30  92  71  11   3
2  79   8   1  33  22  18
3  28  69  55  74  84  96
4  21  72  78  72  91  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that is fair and envy-free, we can employ an approach that considers the agents' valuations to minimize envy and maximize individual satisfaction. In the problem, we aim to allocate the 6 items among the 5 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible.

Here is one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 3 (99). Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 2 (92). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 0 (79). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 5 (96). Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 4 (91). Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

This allocation covers all but one item. Now we need to allocate the remaining item, item 1, in a way that maintains fairness:

- **Agent 1** has the next highest value for item 1 (30) after their allocated item.

Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all six items are distributed, each agent gets an integer number of items, and each agent receives items that are among their top preferences, thereby minimizing envy.
