Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  33  22  91  58  72
1  44  11  30  71  16  84
2  36  86  88  94   6  52
3  73  57  45   7  87  91
4  72  13  66  44  39  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as fair as possible, minimizing envy. An envy-free allocation means that each agent prefers their own allocation over the allocation of any other agent.

One strategy is to attempt to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents, often referred to as the leximin approach. However, given the constraints and valuations, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible, but we can aim to minimize envy as much as possible.

Here is a suggested fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (value 22)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (value 84)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (value 94)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (value 87)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (value 13)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6. The remaining item 0 is assigned to Agent 4, who values it second highest among unassigned items.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This configuration aims to distribute the items in a manner that balances the agents' valuations as fairly as possible given the constraints.
