Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  58  79  51  90  61
1  12  23  53  78  72  74
2   1  55  65  10   9   9
3   6  40  46  15  42  95
4   7  35  25  79   7   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, given each agent's valuation of the items. A common approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" method or a similar approach to minimize envy among agents.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** (values): [53, 58, 79, 51, 90, 61]
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (90)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** (values): [12, 23, 53, 78, 72, 74]
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (78)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** (values): [1, 55, 65, 10, 9, 9]
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (65)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** (values): [6, 40, 46, 15, 42, 95]
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (95)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4** (values): [7, 35, 25, 79, 7, 5]
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (79)
   - Agent 1 already has item 3, so allocate the next highest available, which is Item 1 (35).

6. At this point, items 0, 1, and 2 are unallocated. Since Agent 4 did not receive their top choice, they could be given another item to balance the allocations. After reviewing, Agent 4 can receive Item 0, as it has the least impact on other agents' envy.

Thus, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0: 4
- Agent 1: 3
- Agent 2: 2
- Agent 3: 5
- Agent 4: 0, 1

This allocation is an attempt to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy based on the given valuations. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
