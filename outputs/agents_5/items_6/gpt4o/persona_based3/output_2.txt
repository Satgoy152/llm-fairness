Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  32  97  45  99  81
1  36  71  58  39  12  32
2  98  47  12  81  59  57
3  89  61   7   3  25  82
4  11  26  30  75  35   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we consider the valuations each agent places on the items. We aim to allocate items in a way that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, meaning no agent should prefer another agentâ€™s allocation over their own given their valuations.

Let's analyze the values and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 highly (99) and item 2 significantly (97). Allocating these items to Agent 0 would maximize their utility and minimize envy since these are their top preferences.

2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (71). Allocating item 1 to Agent 1 satisfies their highest valuation.

3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (98). Allocating item 0 to Agent 2 satisfies their highest preference.

4. **Agent 3** has two high valuations: item 0 (89) and item 5 (82). Since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 2, we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 3 (75). Allocating item 3 to Agent 4 satisfies their highest valuation.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 4].
- Agent 1 gets item [1].
- Agent 2 gets item [0].
- Agent 3 gets item [5].
- Agent 4 gets item [3].

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their top-valued items, thus minimizing envy.

The allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
