Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  83  95  72  58  84
1  37  14  69  50  74  99
2  25  60  24  78  95   4
3  21  31  29  13  59  82
4  60  90  98  38   5  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we aim for an allocation where each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each. The challenge is to do this in a way that minimizes envy.

Let's start by examining the table of valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 58     | 83     | 95     | 72     | 58     | 84     |
| 1     | 37     | 14     | 69     | 50     | 74     | 99     |
| 2     | 25     | 60     | 24     | 78     | 95     | 4      |
| 3     | 21     | 31     | 29     | 13     | 59     | 82     |
| 4     | 60     | 90     | 98     | 38     | 5      | 32     |

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 95) - highest value for Agent 0.
2. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 99) - highest value for Agent 1.
3. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 95) - highest value for Agent 2.
4. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 4 (value 90) - highest value for Agent 4.
5. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 58) - second item for Agent 0.
6. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3 (value 13) - lowest remaining value, but there is no other agent highly interested in Item 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the agent with the highest overall values receives two items. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations, reducing potential envy among agents.
