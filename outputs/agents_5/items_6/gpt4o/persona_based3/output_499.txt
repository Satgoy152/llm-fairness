Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  23  31  96  67  48
1  67  76  42   0  71  50
2  35  75  29  49  55  99
3   0  99  66   5  42  55
4  76  39  52  19  75  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the table of valuations, our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

We will use the following approach:
1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Find a way to allocate the items such that the total value each agent receives is as close as possible to each other, reducing envy.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 95 + 23 + 31 + 96 + 67 + 48 = 360
- Agent 1: 67 + 76 + 42 + 0 + 71 + 50 = 306
- Agent 2: 35 + 75 + 29 + 49 + 55 + 99 = 342
- Agent 3: 0 + 99 + 66 + 5 + 42 + 55 = 267
- Agent 4: 76 + 39 + 52 + 19 + 75 + 32 = 293

Next, we will allocate items to balance these values as much as possible:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 highly (96), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly (76), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly (99), so assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 highly (99), but it's already taken. Instead, assign item 2 (66) to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 highly (76), so assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, we have assigned items: 3 (Agent 0), 1 (Agent 1), 5 (Agent 2), 2 (Agent 3), and 0 (Agent 4). The remaining item is 4.

To balance the allocation further:

- Agent 3 has the lowest initial total valuation, so let's assign the remaining item 4 to Agent 3.

Final allocations are:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [2, 4]
- Agent 4: [0]

This allocation strives to balance the total value while considering each agent's highest-valued items. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [0]
}
```
