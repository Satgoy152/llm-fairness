Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40   2  66  46  43  33
1  47  67  56  12  12  99
2  11  67  94   8  74  52
3  78  61  67  91  38  10
4  90  68  45  23  21  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim for an allocation where no agent envies another, meaning each agent should prefer their own allocation over others based on their valuations of the items. This isn't always completely possible with integer allocations, but we strive to minimize envy as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **List each agent's total valuation for all items:**  
   - Agent 0: 230
   - Agent 1: 293
   - Agent 2: 306
   - Agent 3: 345
   - Agent 4: 286

2. **Attempt to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is approximately equal.**  
   The goal is to distribute the items so that the total value each agent receives is as equitable as possible.

3. **Allocate items based on the highest value for each agent:**  
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (66).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (99).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (94), but it's already allocated to Agent 0, so we choose the next highest, which is item 1 (67).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (91).
   - Agent 4 values item 0 the most (90).

4. **Distribute remaining items to minimize envy:**  
   - Remaining items are: 4 and 5
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (second choice after 5, which is already allocated to them).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (next best available option after item 1).

5. **Review allocations to ensure all items are distributed and each agent has a reasonable share.**

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to consider each agent's preferences while distributing the items as fairly as possible.
