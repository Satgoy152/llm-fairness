Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  49  55  73  79  12
1   7  29  50  42  70  70
2  83  24   0  90  20  31
3  83  51  51  44  55  82
4   5   4  26  37  26  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items while ensuring that there is no envy among the agents. One possible approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item" criterion, where no agent envies another agent's allocation except possibly by the removal of a single item from the envied allocation.

Given the valuations, we need to consider the total value each agent places on different combinations of items and try to distribute them so that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0: The highest value items for agent 0 are items 4 and 3. We allocate items 3 and 4 to agent 0.

2. Agent 1: The highest value items for agent 1 are items 4 and 5. Since item 4 is already allocated, we allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. Agent 2: The highest value items for agent 2 are items 3 and 0. Since item 3 is already allocated, we allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. Agent 3: The highest value items for agent 3 are items 0 and 5. Since item 0 is already allocated, we allocate item 1 to agent 3.

5. Agent 4: The highest value items for agent 4 are items 5 and 3. Since item 5 is already allocated, we allocate item 2 to agent 4.

After making these allocations, let's ensure that no more than 6 items are allocated in total and that each agent has their fair share as much as possible given the constraints:

- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [2]

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share as per the balanced strategy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
