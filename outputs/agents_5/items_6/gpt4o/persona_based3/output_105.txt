Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87   0  96  51  11  99
1  61  16  15   8  27  22
2  67  99  12  97   1  13
3  93  51  66  50   3  85
4  96  97  35   6  50  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given that each agent's valuation for each item varies. Since an envy-free allocation may not always be possible with indivisible items, we can attempt to minimize envy by assigning items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: Prioritize assigning items to agents who value them the most. This helps minimize envy, as each agent will receive high-valued items according to their preferences.

2. **Consider balance**: Ensure each agent receives a fair share of items, given there are 6 items and 5 agents. Ideally, each agent should get at least one item, but since there are more agents than items, some agents may end up with no items.

3. **Allocation strategy**:
   - Assign item 5 to agent 0, as they value it highly (value = 99).
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2, who values it the most (value = 99).
   - Assign item 0 to agent 4, who values it the most (value = 96).
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2, who values it highly (value = 97).
   - Assign item 4 to agent 4, who values it considerably (value = 50).
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0, who also values it highly (value = 96).

Let's compile these allocations into the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total individual valuations for each agent, while ensuring all items are distributed. Agent 1 and agent 3 do not receive any items, but the allocations are made to maximize the satisfaction of the agents who receive items.
