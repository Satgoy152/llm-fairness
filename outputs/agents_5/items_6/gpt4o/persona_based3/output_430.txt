Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  11  75  80  40   9
1  65  76  77  85  17  70
2  54  74  85  41   1  28
3   0  96  87  95  74  36
4  77  40  74   6   0  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations, we aim to follow principles of fair division, such as envy-freeness or maximizing total utility. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations can be challenging. Instead, we'll attempt to distribute the items in a manner that appears balanced based on the given valuations.

Given the valuations, a sensible approach could be to assign items in a way that maximizes the perceived value for each agent, while trying to minimize overall envy. Here is a step-by-step method to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0** strongly values items 0 and 3, so we can allocate one of these to them.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest, thus they should receive it.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2, making it a good candidate for them.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest, but since it's already allocated, we can give them item 1.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 5, so it suits them.

Let's allocate the items accordingly, attempting to balance out the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0
- **Agent 1**: Item 3
- **Agent 2**: Item 2
- **Agent 3**: Item 1
- **Agent 4**: Item 5

We still need to allocate item 4. Let's consider which agent would benefit the most from it:

- Agent 0: Value 40
- Agent 1: Value 17
- Agent 2: Value 1
- Agent 3: Value 74
- Agent 4: Value 0

The highest value for item 4 is with Agent 3. Therefore, we'll allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to allocate items based on the highest valuations from each agent's perspective.
