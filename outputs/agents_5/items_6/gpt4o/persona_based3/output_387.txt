Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  38  31  53  98  97
1  47  72  33  61  38  68
2  91  49   4  76  91  45
3  11  38  27   5  40  60
4  40  65  57  81  59   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to aim for an envy-free allocation where possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuation table and six items to allocate, we will follow a process to distribute the items as evenly as possible based on the agents' preferences:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent should ideally receive one item, as there are 5 agents and 6 items. One agent will receive two items.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by allocating the highest value item for each agent.
   - For the remaining items, allocate in a way that minimizes envy.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 4 (98), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 1 (72), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 0 and 4 (both 91), but since item 4 is already taken, we allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 5 (60), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4** has the highest value for item 3 (81), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items as follows:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [3]

One item (2) remains to be allocated. We will allocate this item to the agent who values it the most without causing significant envy:

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 31.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 33.
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 4.
- Agent 3 values item 2 at 27.
- Agent 4 values item 2 at 57.

Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 2 and already has one item. Allocating item 2 to Agent 4 minimizes envy.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [3, 2]

Presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 2]
}
```
