Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  49   4  36  57  23
1  22  85  38  56  61  80
2  49  55  76  53  14  21
3   5   5  28  57  30  77
4  53  82  92  53  86  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with the aim of minimizing envy among agents, we can use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that any envy an agent might have towards another can be eliminated by removing at most one item from the other agent's allocation. Given the agents' valuations for the items, let's proceed with the allocation:

### Valuations Table:

| Agent | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0     | 98 | 49 | 4  | 36 | 57 | 23 |
| 1     | 22 | 85 | 38 | 56 | 61 | 80 |
| 2     | 49 | 55 | 76 | 53 | 14 | 21 |
| 3     | 5  | 5  | 28 | 57 | 30 | 77 |
| 4     | 53 | 82 | 92 | 53 | 86 | 41 |

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Assign Items to Maximize Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 98.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 85.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 76.
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 77.
   - Agent 4 values item 4 the highest at 86.

2. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 are already allocated. Only item 3 remains.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 36, and Agent 4 values it at 53. Allocating item 3 to Agent 4 maximizes overall valuation, as Agent 4 has the highest valuation for it.

### Final Allocation:

Following these steps, each agent is allocated items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation seeks to minimize envy and ensure a fair distribution of items based on the agents' valuations, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
