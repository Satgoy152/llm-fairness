Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  37  74  60  29  33
1  94  80   8  34  93  59
2  21  54  46  37  81   9
3  10  13  33  99  43  17
4  95  62  72  91  27  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over others, or at least not envy any other agent's allocation.

Given the table of valuations, we will use a heuristic approach to allocate the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the highest (74). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the highest (94). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest (81). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the highest (99). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 the highest (85). Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

At this point, each agent has received one item, and we still have one item left to allocate (item 1). Let's allocate this item based on the highest remaining valuation among agents who would benefit most from an additional item:

- **Item 1**: Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 1 (80).

Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an item they value highly, and the remaining item is allocated to an agent who values it significantly, aiming to minimize envy.
