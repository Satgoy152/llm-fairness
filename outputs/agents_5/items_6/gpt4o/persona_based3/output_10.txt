Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87   9  84  51  86   5
1  31  51  55  46  54  81
2  66  58  67  80  68  65
3  97  91  68  50  47  41
4  39  71  14  39  15  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. One common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation, though achieving perfect envy-freeness may not always be possible. Instead, we can strive for an allocation that is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Start by identifying which agent values each item the most. This can guide initial allocations.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (value = 97).
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most (value = 91).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (value = 84).
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (value = 80).
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (value = 86).
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (value = 81).

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** 
   - Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.
   - Try to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 4 (Total value = 170)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (Total value = 81)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (Total value = 80)
   - Agent 3: Items 0, 1 (Total value = 188)
   - Agent 4: No items (Total value = 0)

Given these considerations, here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
