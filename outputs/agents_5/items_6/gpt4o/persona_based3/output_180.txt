Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  95  41  41   0  72
1  15  78  87  47  87  53
2  76  91  35  36  53  24
3   1   9  86  90  53   7
4  67  23  55  64  11  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 6 items are distributed in total. The goal is to achieve a fair division that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item**: Sum the valuations of each item across all agents to see which items are most valued overall.

2. **Assign Items to Agents**: Assign items to agents based on maximizing each agent's individual value while trying to distribute the total valuation evenly among the agents to minimize envy.

3. **Check Fairness**: Ensure that the allocation is as balanced as possible, considering the constraints.

4. **Adjust if Necessary**: Make adjustments to ensure that exactly 6 items are allocated, and that the distribution remains as fair as possible.

Following this method, we can arrive at a fair allocation:

- Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 0 and Agent 2, but Agent 0 values it the most.
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 1.
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 3.
- Item 4 is equally valued by Agents 1 and 3, but Agent 3 values it slightly higher when paired with other items.
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 0.
- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 2.

Considering these observations, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 5, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 2 receives item 0, which they value the highest.
- Agent 3 receives item 3, their highest valued item.
- Agent 4 receives item 4, which is not highly valued by anyone but helps balance the distribution.
