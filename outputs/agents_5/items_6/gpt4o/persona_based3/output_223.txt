Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  12  53  61  12  34
1  68  89  19  90  44  30
2  91  96  10  72  42  84
3  22  96  33  36  41  98
4  58  78  95  31  19  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. Given the valuations, one approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking the items they value the most, in order of priority determined by some fair criteria (e.g., lexicographic order or a randomized order).

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their overall preferences.
2. Use a round-robin picking system based on the agent's total value allocation.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 49 + 12 + 53 + 61 + 12 + 34 = 221
- Agent 1: 68 + 89 + 19 + 90 + 44 + 30 = 340
- Agent 2: 91 + 96 + 10 + 72 + 42 + 84 = 395
- Agent 3: 22 + 96 + 33 + 36 + 41 + 98 = 326
- Agent 4: 58 + 78 + 95 + 31 + 19 + 59 = 340

Let's allocate by allowing each agent to pick one item each round based on their highest preference until all items are allocated:

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 61)
   - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 90) -> Since item 3 is taken, pick next preferred item 1 (value 89)
   - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 96) -> Since item 1 is taken, pick next preferred item 0 (value 91)
   - Agent 3 picks item 5 (value 98)
   - Agent 4 picks item 2 (value 95)

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 53) -> Since item 2 is taken, pick next preferred item 0 (value 49)
   - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 44)
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 84) -> Since item 5 is taken, pick next preferred item 4 (value 42)
   - Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 36) -> Since item 3 is taken, pick next preferred item 1 (value 96) -> Since item 1 is taken, pick next preferred item 4 (value 41)
   - Agent 4 picks item 0 (value 58) -> Since item 0 is taken, pick next preferred item 1 (value 78) -> Since item 1 is taken, pick next preferred item 5 (value 59) -> Since item 5 is taken, pick next preferred item 3 (value 31)

3. **Remaining Allocation:**
   - Items 1 and 4 remain unallocated:
     - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (next preferred)
     - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (next preferred)

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

Note: The allocation was adjusted to ensure that each agent receives at least one item. This allocation may not fully achieve envy-freeness but ensures the distribution of items with the given constraints.
