Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  34  89  21  73  85
1  26  15  53  11  52  65
2  84  15  16  15  87  85
3  51  76  61  43  53  95
4  84   1  87   1  25  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the data, we need to assign each of the 6 items to one of the 5 agents.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly (89) and item 5 (85) almost equally. Assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has relatively balanced valuations except for item 5, which has a good valuation (65). Assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 0 (84) and 4 (87). Assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 5, but since it's already taken, assign item 1 (76) to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values items 0 (84) and 2 (87). Since item 2 is already taken, assign item 0 to agent 4.

Now we have 1 item left to allocate (item 3). We will choose based on minimizing envy:

6. **Agent 3** has a higher preference for item 3 than the remaining agent (agent 1), so assign item 3 to agent 3.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and it aims to minimize envy based on the highest valuation possible for each agent.
