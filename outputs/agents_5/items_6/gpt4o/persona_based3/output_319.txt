Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  66  19  81  89   1
1  65  54  22  59  97  79
2  94  86  47   0  17  10
3  15  32   8  88  17  36
4  82  70  75   9  80  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation where no agent envies another, as much as possible. Given the small number of items and agents, we can approach this problem using a simple heuristic method, attempting to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest-valued items first.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuation Items:**
   - Agent 0's highest valuations: Item 4 (89), Item 3 (81)
   - Agent 1's highest valuations: Item 4 (97), Item 5 (79)
   - Agent 2's highest valuations: Item 0 (94), Item 1 (86)
   - Agent 3's highest valuations: Item 3 (88), Item 1 (32)
   - Agent 4's highest valuations: Item 0 (82), Item 4 (80)

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value among all agents for this item).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest value for this item after Agent 3, but Agent 0 has no other high-value item left).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value among all agents for this item).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (second highest value for this item after Agent 0, but Agent 2 has no other items).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (second highest value for this item after Agent 2, but Agent 1 has another valuable item).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 4 (highest remaining value for Agent 4).

3. **Adjustments:**
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item where possible, while maintaining the highest total value for each agent.

After these considerations, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that they value highly while ensuring that all items are distributed and minimizing envy.
