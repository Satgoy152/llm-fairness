Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  26  28  83  71  55
1  59  53  53  98  24  82
2  57  87  63  70  78   0
3  83  80  62  57  87  22
4  74  89  78  52  71  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the preferences of each agent for the items. A common approach is to use a method called "round-robin" or "sequential allocation," where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item. Given the valuations, we can simulate this process:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent ascribes to all items**:
    - Agent 0: \(48 + 26 + 28 + 83 + 71 + 55 = 311\)
    - Agent 1: \(59 + 53 + 53 + 98 + 24 + 82 = 369\)
    - Agent 2: \(57 + 87 + 63 + 70 + 78 + 0 = 355\)
    - Agent 3: \(83 + 80 + 62 + 57 + 87 + 22 = 391\)
    - Agent 4: \(74 + 89 + 78 + 52 + 71 + 65 = 429\)

2. **Determine the order of picking based on total value (highest total value picks first)**:
    - Order: Agent 4, Agent 3, Agent 1, Agent 2, Agent 0

3. **Allocate items using a round-robin selection based on preferences**:
    - Agent 4 picks item 1 (value = 89)
    - Agent 3 picks item 0 (value = 83)
    - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value = 98)
    - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value = 78)
    - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value = 55)

4. **Second round of allocation (remaining items: 2, 4, 5)**:
    - Agent 4 picks item 2 (value = 78)

5. **Final allocation**:
    - Agent 0: [5]
    - Agent 1: [3]
    - Agent 2: [4]
    - Agent 3: [0]
    - Agent 4: [1, 2]

By following this allocation, each agent gets at least one item they highly value given the order and there is a fair distribution of items. Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```
