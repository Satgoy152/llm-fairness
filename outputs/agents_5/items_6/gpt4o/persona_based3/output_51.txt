Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5   9  80   1  82  34
1  38  26  74  97  22  35
2  72  76  26   4   4  59
3  16  36   8  94  53   3
4  66  15  30  43  42  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to allocate items in a way that can be considered envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. We will use the valuations provided to guide the allocation process. 

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
Agent/Item  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |
------------------------------------------------
Agent 0     |  5  |  9  | 80  |  1  | 82  | 34  |
Agent 1     | 38  | 26  | 74  | 97  | 22  | 35  |
Agent 2     | 72  | 76  | 26  |  4  |  4  | 59  |
Agent 3     | 16  | 36  |  8  | 94  | 53  |  3  |
Agent 4     | 66  | 15  | 30  | 43  | 42  | 69  |
```

A heuristic approach to find a fair allocation might involve assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while trying to ensure that each agent receives at least some value.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value by Agent 2 (72).
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value by Agent 2 (76).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest value by Agent 0 (80).
   
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest value by Agent 1 (97).

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest value by Agent 0 (82).

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest value by Agent 4 (69).

### Allocations:

Following the heuristic strategy, we assign the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Item 5

### Resulting JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and every item is allocated.
