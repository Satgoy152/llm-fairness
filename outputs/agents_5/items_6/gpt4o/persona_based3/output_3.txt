Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  40  87  60  12  39
1  76  86  49  60  18  61
2  61  95  16  93  41  18
3  39   4   0   9  84  46
4  58  83  51  80  98  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maintaining the goal of envy-freeness, we can consider the valuations of the items by each agent. The main objective is to distribute the items such that no agent feels that another agent has a better allocation, given their valuations.

Let's analyze the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations**: Item 2 (87), Item 3 (60)
2. **Agent 1's highest valuations**: Item 1 (86), Item 0 (76)
3. **Agent 2's highest valuations**: Item 1 (95), Item 3 (93)
4. **Agent 3's highest valuations**: Item 4 (84), Item 5 (46)
5. **Agent 4's highest valuations**: Item 4 (98), Item 3 (80)

A possible fair allocation that respects each agent's preferences and ensures all items are allocated could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 3
- **Agent 3**: Item 5
- **Agent 4**: Item 0, Item 4

This allocation takes into account the highest-valued items for each agent, distributing them in a way that each agent gets a significant portion of their value preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
