Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  94  34   5  42  39
1  14   4  85  78  34  71
2  12   3  52  99  41  46
3  45  99  74  57   9  32
4  47  78  82  60  21  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that respects their individual preferences while considering the constraints of envy-freeness and integer allocations. Since we are dealing with integer allocations and 6 items, each agent should ideally receive at least one item if possible. We will prioritize assigning items based on the highest relative value to each agent.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 1 (94). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (85). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 3 (99). Assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 1 (99), but item 1 is already taken. Next highest is item 0 (45), assign item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 5 (91). Assign item 5 to agent 4.

Now, 5 items have been allocated, and item 4 is still unallocated.

6. **Unallocated Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 42
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 34
   - Agent 2 values item 4 at 41
   - Agent 3 values item 4 at 9
   - Agent 4 values item 4 at 21
   
   Agent 0 values item 4 the highest among the remaining agents who have not received two items yet. Assign item 4 to agent 0.

The allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation aims for fairness by distributing items based on the highest relative value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.
