Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  27  14  61  17  37
1  30  27  86   7  72  75
2  78  28  12  44  20  27
3  47  43  27  56  60  41
4  62  79  57  87  44  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that attempts to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, we can consider using the concept of maximizing each agent's utility based on their valuations while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible.

Let's examine the valuations given:

```
Agent 0: [37, 27, 14, 61, 17, 37]
Agent 1: [30, 27, 86,  7, 72, 75]
Agent 2: [78, 28, 12, 44, 20, 27]
Agent 3: [47, 43, 27, 56, 60, 41]
Agent 4: [62, 79, 57, 87, 44, 76]
```

To start, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that attempts to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Afterward, we can adjust the allocation to ensure fairness, if necessary.

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values the most at 78.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 4 values the most at 79.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values the most at 86.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 4 values the most at 87.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 values the most at 72.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 1 values the most at 75.

Initial allocation based on highest valuation:

- Agent 0: none
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: none
- Agent 4: [1, 3]

Now, let's check if we can adjust allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible and try to reduce envy:

Agent 1 has three items, and Agent 0 and Agent 3 have none. We can try to reallocate items to balance out the distribution:

- Consider reallocating Item 4 (72, value to Agent 1) to Agent 3, who values it at 60. This still keeps Agent 1 with a high-value allocation and provides something for Agent 3.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: [5] (Item 5 was transferred from Agent 1 to Agent 0)
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [1, 3]

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and it attempts to maintain fairness based on each agent's preferences.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```
