Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  74  33   4  72  63
1  78  55  97  55  20  61
2  11  80  58  92  74  58
3  69  23  53  69  96  31
4  42  54  85  92  22  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we aim for a division where each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their individual satisfaction, adhering to principles like envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations table, let's proceed with a heuristic allocation that takes into account the agents' preferences.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (value: 96)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item not yet allocated: Item 2 (value: 97)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item not yet allocated: Item 3 (value: 92)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item not yet allocated: Item 4 (value: 96)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued item not yet allocated: Item 1 (value: 54)

6. **Leftover item allocation**:
   - Item 5 is still unallocated and should be assigned to the agent with the highest remaining value for it.
   - Agent 0 values Item 5 at 63, which is the highest remaining value among all agents for Item 5.

After this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation takes into account each agent's highest preferences and ensures all items are distributed. The process attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one of their top-valued items, whenever possible.
