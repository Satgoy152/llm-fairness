Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78   3  15  82  82  94
1   4  43  31  89  92   7
2  23  90  30  27  44  75
3   9  12  79   0  78  58
4  10  78  78  13  93  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering each agent's valuation, we should aim to achieve a distribution that is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. A typical approach is to maximize each agent's total perceived value for their allocation.

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 3, 4, and 5. However, to balance allocations:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values items 3 and 4 the most:
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4** highly values item 4 but it is already taken; instead, they value item 3 which is still available:
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

After this distribution, item 5 is still unallocated. To maximize fairness and avoid envy:

6. **Agent 2** has a reasonable value for item 5:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value across agents as much as possible, given the constraints. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```
