Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  31  32  77  15  83
1  77  58  34  51  30  32
2  42   6  61  12  71  24
3  74  18  42  56  49  31
4  39  61  35  96  81  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, given their own valuations.

Given the valuations, one approach is to use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or similar heuristic to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Here, I will provide a heuristic allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 5.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 4.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 0.
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 3.

To maximize fairness, we'll assign items based on highest value first and then distribute the remaining items to balance out the allocations.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (highest value for item 5).
- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (one of the highest values for item 0).
- Assign item 4 to agent 2 (highest value for item 4).
- Assign item 3 to agent 4 (highest value for item 3).

Now, we have items 1 and 2 left. To balance the allocation:

- Assign item 1 to agent 0 since they have a relatively high value for it.
- Assign item 2 to agent 3 since they have a decent value for it, and agent 3 has not received an item yet.

This allocation aims to balance the number of items and maximize satisfaction according to the given valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```
