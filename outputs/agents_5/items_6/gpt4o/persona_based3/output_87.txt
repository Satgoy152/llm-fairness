Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  67  33  85  22  85
1  66  21  74  48  15  60
2  86  39  59  55  41  59
3  42  95  44  88   3  18
4  55  44  84  20  54  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a division that minimizes envy and attempts to balance the valuations each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step outline of the approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** We first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.

2. **Determine Initial Allocation:** Start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Swap items between agents if it increases the fairness of the allocation. Fairness here refers to minimizing envy, where no agent should feel another agent has a more valuable allocation.

4. **Final Adjustments:** Ensure each agent has an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Valuations

| Agent | Total Valuation |
|-------|-----------------|
| 0     | 381             |
| 1     | 284             |
| 2     | 339             |
| 3     | 290             |
| 4     | 319             |

### Allocation Process

1. **Item Prioritization:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (highest value: 95).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value: 86).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (highest value: 54).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest value: 85).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value: 74).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value: 85).

2. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Each agent has at least one item.
   - Total allocation satisfies all items are allocated.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest preferences where possible and ensures each agent ends up with at least one item if feasible, while all items are distributed.
