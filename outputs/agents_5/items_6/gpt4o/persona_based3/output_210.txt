Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  99  56  16  19  35
1  92  64  69  72  44  20
2  75  16  95  62  98  90
3   5  53  78  15  24  36
4  14  61  69  35  12  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent. Given the complexity and intricacies of achieving a perfect envy-free allocation, we will strive for a fair and balanced division based on the provided valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations to determine a satisfactory allocation:

- **Agent 0's highest values:** 99 (item 1), 72 (item 0)
- **Agent 1's highest values:** 92 (item 0), 72 (item 3)
- **Agent 2's highest values:** 98 (item 4), 95 (item 2)
- **Agent 3's highest values:** 78 (item 2), 53 (item 1)
- **Agent 4's highest values:** 69 (item 2), 61 (item 1)

We need to allocate six items such that each agent has a maximum number of high-value items they prefer. An effective strategy is to assign items based on these preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one high-value item.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** [1] (item 1 is highly valued by Agent 0)
- **Agent 1:** [0, 3] (items 0 and 3 are highly valued by Agent 1)
- **Agent 2:** [4] (item 4 is highly valued by Agent 2)
- **Agent 3:** [2] (item 2 is valued by Agent 3)
- **Agent 4:** [5] (item 5 is the remaining item)

This allocation is balanced in terms of each agent receiving an item that they value significantly and attempts to minimize envy among agents.

Resulting JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```
