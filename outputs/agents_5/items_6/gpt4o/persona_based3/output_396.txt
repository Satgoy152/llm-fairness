Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  52  87  15  77   6
1  69  80  55  87   3  82
2  73  95  44  61  20  67
3  84  90  42  86  14  28
4  87  85  84  57  39  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own given their valuations. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations, we can aim for a close approximation where each agent feels they receive a fair share.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (87), Item 4 (77)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (87), Item 5 (82)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (95), Item 5 (67)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (90), Item 0 (84)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (87), Item 5 (80)

Given these preferences, let's attempt a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Assign Item 2 (87). This is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 1:** Assign Item 3 (87). This is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 2:** Assign Item 1 (95). This is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 3:** Assign Item 0 (84). Although their highest is Item 1, it's already allocated to Agent 2. Item 0 is a close second.
- **Agent 4:** Assign Item 5 (80). Although their highest is Item 0, it's already allocated to Agent 3. Item 5 is a good alternative.

For the remaining item (Item 4), we look for the best fit:

- Agent 0's next highest value after Item 2 is Item 4 (77).
- Agent 1 has low interest in Item 4.
- Agent 2 has low interest in Item 4.
- Agent 3 has a low value for Item 4.
- Agent 4 has a low value for Item 4.

Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 as it is their next highest preference.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to align with the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Each agent receives items they value highly, achieving a fair distribution considering the constraints.
