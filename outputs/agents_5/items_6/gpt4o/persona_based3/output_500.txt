Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  33  43  85  35  24
1  13   1  23  94  82  32
2  77  66  37   8  97  90
3   0  69   1  87  62  10
4  78  75  79  77  42  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Given the matrix of valuations, we will attempt to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes the overall satisfaction.

Let's consider the sum of valuations for each agent and then allocate items to maximize the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:** Values are [43, 33, 43, 85, 35, 24], total sum = 263.
2. **Agent 1:** Values are [13, 1, 23, 94, 82, 32], total sum = 245.
3. **Agent 2:** Values are [77, 66, 37, 8, 97, 90], total sum = 375.
4. **Agent 3:** Values are [0, 69, 1, 87, 62, 10], total sum = 229.
5. **Agent 4:** Values are [78, 75, 79, 77, 42, 22], total sum = 373.

To allocate the items, we can start by assigning items based on the highest valuation for each item:

- **Item 0:** Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (78).
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (75).
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (79).
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (94).
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (97).
- **Item 5:** Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (90).

Now, ensure that every agent gets at least one item and try to balance the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0] (value = 43)
- Agent 1: [3] (value = 94)
- Agent 2: [4, 5] (value = 187)
- Agent 3: [] 
- Agent 4: [1, 2] (value = 154)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a reasonable number of items based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```
