Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  30  11  55   0   8
1  37  35  76  15  25  79
2  75   6  18  74  50  32
3  47   7  24  51   6  61
4  59  61  49  51  38   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy and attempts to maximize each agentâ€™s satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a modified version of the "round-robin" algorithm or the "envy-free" allocation method. Given the table of valuations, we will proceed with the allocation:

1. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most**: This intuitive approach can often lead to a fair distribution, although it may not always be envy-free. We'll start from there and adjust if necessary.

2. **Adjust to ensure fairness and envy-freeness**: After the initial allocation, we will check if any agent envies another agent's allocation. If envy exists, we can make swaps or adjustments to reduce or eliminate it.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Item 0**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (75).
- **Item 1**: Valued highest by Agent 4 (61).
- **Item 2**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (76).
- **Item 3**: Valued highest by Agent 0 (55).
- **Item 4**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (50).
- **Item 5**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (79).

Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [1]

### Check for Fairness and Envy:

Upon reviewing, Agent 3 has no items and may envy others. We need to ensure that every agent receives some value without creating excessive envy.

- Swap between Agent 2 and Agent 3: Give item 0 from Agent 2 to Agent 3 since Agent 2 has multiple items.

Adjusted Allocation:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [1]

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and while some envy may still exist, it minimizes it given the constraints.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints of distributing exactly six items and attempts to provide a fair division based on the given valuations.
