Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  58  32  11  85  18
1  41  12  14  41  14  26
2  59   8  39  61  54  39
3  63  74  54  30  34  57
4  51  83  67  68  86  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels that they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step 1: Evaluate High-Value Preferences
- Identify the most valued items for each agent to prioritize their allocation.

### Step 2: Initial Allocation
- Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, attempting to balance the total value across agents.

### Step 3: Adjust for Fairness
- Adjust allocations to reduce envy, ensuring each agent's allocation is as balanced as possible according to their value perception.

### Allocation Process
1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the most (85). Allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the most (41). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the most (61). Allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the most (74). Allocate item 1 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 4 the most (86), but it's already allocated. Next, item 1 (83), but it's also allocated. Allocate item 5 (79) to agent 4.
6. The remaining item, 2, can be allocated to the agent with the least total value from their perspective. In this case, allocate item 2 to agent 2 to balance the total perceived value.

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives items according to their highest valuations while balancing the total value perceived by each agent, aiming for envy-freeness as much as possible.
