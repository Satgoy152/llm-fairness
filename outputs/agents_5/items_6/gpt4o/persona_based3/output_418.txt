Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  18  21  71  22  92
1   4  79   3  38  93  85
2  58   0  94  77  12  50
3   3  44  72  58  53  21
4  82  72  35  91  28  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, given constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is challenging due to differing valuations, but we can attempt to minimize envy by considering the agents' valuations of items.

Here is a proposed allocation that considers the agents' preferences and attempts to balance their overall satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 0, 3, and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 4, 5, and 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 2, 3, and 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 2, 0, and 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers items 5, 3, and 0.

Using a fair division approach, such as the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, we try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the product of utilities, or alternatively, balances the envy among agents.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 3]
- **Agent 1**: [4]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: [1]
- **Agent 4**: [5]

This allocation considers the highest preferences of each agent and tries to ensure no agent feels significantly envious of another by balancing their most valued items. Note that each agent may not get their top choice due to conflicting preferences, but the allocation aims to mitigate envy as much as possible.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
