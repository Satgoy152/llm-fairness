Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98   3  23  49   9  96
1  37  43  76  14  16  82
2  96  42  55  12  36  40
3   8  13   6  83  33  13
4  95  62  90  39  40  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. Given the complexity of the problem and the constraint of integer allocations, a perfect envy-free allocation might not be possible, but we can aim for a fair and balanced distribution based on maximizing total valuations for each agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest values for items 0 and 5.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest values for items 2 and 5.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest values for items 0 and 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest values for items 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest values for items 0, 2, and 1.

Using these observations, we can attempt to allocate items such that the overall satisfaction (valuation) is maximized for each agent. Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Allocate items 0 and 5. (Values: 98 and 96)
- **Agent 1:** Allocate item 2. (Value: 76)
- **Agent 2:** Allocate item 1. (Value: 42)
- **Agent 3:** Allocate item 3. (Value: 83)
- **Agent 4:** Allocate item 4. (Value: 40)

This distribution aims to maximize the highest valued items for each agent within the given constraints. Let's now present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
