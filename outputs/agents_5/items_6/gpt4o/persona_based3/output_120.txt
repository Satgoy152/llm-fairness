Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  39  99  97  50   8
1   8  99  88  56  57  14
2   3  40  15  97  76  92
3  64  92  67  46   6  74
4  76  31  79  67  67  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as that of any other agent, given their own valuations. However, achieving complete envy-freeness might not be possible with an integer allocation, so we aim to minimize envy.

Here is the table of valuations for ease of reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  39  99  97  50   8
1   8  99  88  56  57  14
2   3  40  15  97  76  92
3  64  92  67  46   6  74
4  76  31  79  67  67  38
```

To start, let's identify which items are highly valued by each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 2 (99) and item 3 (97) the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 1 (99) the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 5 (92) and item 4 (76) highly.
- Agent 3 values item 1 (92) and item 0 (64) highly.
- Agent 4 values item 0 (76) and item 2 (79) highly.

We can start by allocating these high-value items to the respective agents and then adjust to minimize envy:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, we have items 3 and 4 remaining with Agent 3 yet to receive any item. Since Agent 3 also values item 1 highly, but it is already allocated to Agent 1, we will allocate the remaining items to minimize envy:

5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (for their second-highest valuation).
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (even though it's not highly valued, it's a remaining option).

Here's how the allocation looks in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by prioritizing agents' highest valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, with the exception of Agent 1 who receives only their top choice, which is highly valuable to them.
