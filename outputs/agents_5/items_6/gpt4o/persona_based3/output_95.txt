Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  12  59  33  68  51
1  40   2  67  24  47  92
2  67  99  34  11  75  28
3  41  23  45  60  77   0
4  25  67  29  99  35  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for envy-freeness and an equitable distribution. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction, measured by their valuations, while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation per Agent:** Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. **Assign Items Iteratively:** Start by assigning the highest valued item for each agent, ensuring no two agents get the same item.
3. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness:** After an initial allocation, make adjustments to minimize envy, ensuring each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** [55, 12, 59, 33, 68, 51]
   - Assign item 4 (highest value 68 for Agent 0).

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** [40, 2, 67, 24, 47, 92]
   - Assign item 5 (highest value 92 for Agent 1).

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** [67, 99, 34, 11, 75, 28]
   - Assign item 1 (highest value 99 for Agent 2).

4. **Agent 3's Valuations:** [41, 23, 45, 60, 77, 0]
   - Assign item 3 (highest value 60 for Agent 3, after considering previously assigned items).

5. **Agent 4's Valuations:** [25, 67, 29, 99, 35, 71]
   - Assign item 0 (highest value 25 for Agent 4, after considering previously assigned items).

6. **Remaining Items:** 
   - Item 2 is left. It has the highest remaining value for Agent 0 (59).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items maximizing their valuations while attempting to minimize envy. The process focuses on giving each agent their highest valued available item and adjusts iteratively to maintain fairness.
