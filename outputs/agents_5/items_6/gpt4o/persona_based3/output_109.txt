Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  10  30  38  39  26
1  30  80  49  25  40  47
2  51  84  58   4  85  89
3   3  28  82  57  44  52
4  70  81   7   1  49  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free division where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other allocation, given their preferences. While it might not always be possible to achieve perfect envy-freeness with discrete items, we can aim for a division that minimizes envy and seems fair based on the given valuations.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a reasonable allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their overall preferences.

2. **Identify High-Value Items**: Identify items that have particularly high valuations for specific agents, as these might be critical in their perception of a fair allocation.

3. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating the most valued items to the agents who value them the highest, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

4. **Adjust for Fairness**: After the initial allocation, adjust by swapping items or reallocating to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share compared to others.

Let's apply this to our dataset:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 0 highly.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highly.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highly.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 2 highly.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 0 or 1 highly, but also 4.

Considering these preferences and trying to spread the value, here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 3]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1]
- **Agent 2**: Items [5]
- **Agent 3**: Items [2]
- **Agent 4**: Items [4]

This allocation considers each agent's highest valued item and tries to distribute the rest fairly. Adjustments can be made if further analysis of envy or fairness is required, but this should provide a reasonable starting point.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and it aligns reasonably well with the agents' valuations, aiming to minimize envy.
