Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  20   0  67  47  54
1  68  97  77   4  51  88
2  94  30  56  69  80  29
3  73  48  73  33  30  37
4  42  51   2  97  79  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that aims for envy-freeness, we try to allocate items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation, if possible. Given the valuations, we will try to distribute the items considering each agent's highest valuations.

First, let's identify the highest-valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (67).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (97).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (94).
- Agent 3 values items 0 and 2 equally (73).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most (97).

The challenge is to distribute these items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Here is a possible allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [3] (value = 67)
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 5] (value = 97 + 88 = 185)
- **Agent 2**: Item [0] (value = 94)
- **Agent 3**: Item [2] (value = 73)
- **Agent 4**: Item [4] (value = 79)

This allocation takes into account each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent and that the total number of items allocated is six.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
