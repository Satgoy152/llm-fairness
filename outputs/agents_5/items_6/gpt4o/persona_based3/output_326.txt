Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  50  20  40  86  77
1  24  95  33  22  84  85
2   9  40  21  59  87  92
3  71  59  75  15  60  94
4  97  72  10  11  67  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations to reduce envy as much as possible. Given the constraints and the need for each agent to receive an integer number of items, here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value for items: 0 (98), 4 (86), 5 (77)
   - Allocation: Item 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for items: 1 (95), 5 (85), 4 (84)
   - Allocation: Item 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for items: 5 (92), 4 (87), 3 (59)
   - Allocation: Item 5

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value for items: 5 (94), 2 (75), 0 (71)
   - Allocation: Item 2

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value for items: 0 (97), 1 (72), 4 (67)
   - Allocation: Items 3 and 4

This allocation considers the highest valuations of each agent and aims to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives at least one of their most valued items given the constraints.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
