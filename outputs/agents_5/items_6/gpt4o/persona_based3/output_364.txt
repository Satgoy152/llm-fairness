Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  35  22  74  28  73
1  65  48  73  61  61  55
2  37  57   1   2  25  67
3  77  90  76  29  71  22
4  60  97  99  80  22  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free solution, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them so that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to arrive at a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (74).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (73).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most (67).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (90).
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the most (99).

2. **Initial Assignment Attempt:**
   - Based on the highest values, assign each agent their highest valued item. However, note that item 2 is the highest valued item for both agents 1 and 4, so further analysis is needed.

3. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - Since both Agent 1 and Agent 4 highly value item 2, we need to find an alternative allocation to minimize envy.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (since it has the highest value of 99 for them), and select the next highest available item for Agent 1, which would be item 0 (value 65).

4. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Assign remaining items in a way that balances total valuations across agents and ensures integer allocations.

5. **Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (value 74)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (value 65)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (value 67)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (value 90)
   - Agent 4: Item 2 (value 99)
   - Remaining item (4) can be assigned to Agent 2 to balance out valuations (value 25).

6. **Final Check:**
   - Ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent has received their fair share based on their valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, with the total valuation being as balanced as possible given the constraints.
