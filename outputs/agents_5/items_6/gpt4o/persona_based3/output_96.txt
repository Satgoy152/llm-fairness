Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  64  28  16   7  53
1   6   5  73  73  63  16
2  19  63  41   8  77  58
3  94  73  46  36  97  30
4  76  63  91  94  84  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free or as close to envy-free allocation as possible. Given the valuations, our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items is exactly 6.

Here is the table of valuations for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  64  28  16   7  53
1   6   5  73  73  63  16
2  19  63  41   8  77  58
3  94  73  46  36  97  30
4  76  63  91  94  84  22
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Valued Items:** Start by identifying the highest valued items for each agent to minimize envy.
2. **Assign Unique High-Value Items:** Allocate each agent a high-value item, ensuring no two agents are assigned the same item.
3. **Distribute Remaining Items:** Assign the remaining items to agents who value them more than others, or are left without a high-value item.

### Step-by-Step Allocation

- **Agent 0:** Highest value for item 1 (64). Assign item 1.
- **Agent 1:** Highest value for items 2 and 3 (73 each). Since item 2 has a slightly higher relative importance, assign item 2.
- **Agent 2:** Highest value for item 4 (77). Assign item 4.
- **Agent 3:** Highest value for item 0 (94). Assign item 0.
- **Agent 4:** Highest value for item 3 (94). Assign item 3.

Now, item 5 remains unallocated. We need to assign it to minimize overall envy.

- **Remaining item 5:** Agent 2 values item 5 the most after item 4. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation

Based on the above strategy, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent, where possible, receives an item they highly value, and all items are distributed.
