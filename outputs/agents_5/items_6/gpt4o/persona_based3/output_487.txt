Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  87  57   6  36  58
1  67  50  42   8  39  61
2   6  70  20  52  62  53
3  94  20  92  63  33  14
4  56  88  49  98  60  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to distribute them such that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. Given that we have 5 agents and 6 items, at least one agent will receive more than one item, or some agents will receive none. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items for Each Agent**: Analyze the table to determine which items each agent values the most.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Valuations**:
   - Try to allocate items such that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, reducing the chance of envy.
   - Consider the possibility of giving an agent two items if it maximizes their valuation without causing envy.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Since there are 6 items and 5 agents, ensure all items are allocated without exceeding the total.

Considering these points, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 5
  - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (60) compared to other agents, and item 5 is also fairly valued (58).

- **Agent 1**: Item 2
  - Agent 1 values item 2 moderately (42), but it ensures they have at least one item.

- **Agent 2**: Item 4
  - Agent 2 values item 4 significantly (62), which is their highest valued item.

- **Agent 3**: Item 3
  - Agent 3 values item 3 highly (63) and can be satisfied with it.

- **Agent 4**: Item 1
  - Agent 4 values item 1 extremely high (88), making it a suitable choice.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value and that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
