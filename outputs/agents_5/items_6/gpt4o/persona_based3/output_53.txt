Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  24  45  19  32  16
1  32   6  73  51  72  37
2  54  51  81  65  96  65
3  23  36  40  26  99  51
4  69  47  96  93  29  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to it as possible, given the constraints. This means that each agent should feel that they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

To find a solution, we can use a method that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent believes they have received a fair share, minimizing envy among the agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (96), so we assign item 4 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 2 (96), so we assign item 2 to agent 4.
3. **Agent 0** has a relatively high valuation for item 0 (53) compared to others, so we assign item 0 to agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 3 (51) compared to others, so we assign item 3 to agent 1.
5. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 5 (51) compared to others, so we assign item 5 to agent 3.
6. Finally, item 1 is left, and based on the remaining valuations, **Agent 4** has a decent valuation (47) for item 1, so we assign item 1 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 1]
}
```
