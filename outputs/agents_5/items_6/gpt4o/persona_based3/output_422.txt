Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  19  74  25  13  60
1  42  21   5  18  66  97
2  19   0  78  10  21  90
3  12  66  86  25   0  85
4   1  53  62  95  79  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations, we will strive for a balanced approach that minimizes envy and ensures each agent has a reasonable share of value.

Let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 values all items at a total of \(85 + 19 + 74 + 25 + 13 + 60 = 276\).
- Agent 1 values all items at a total of \(42 + 21 + 5 + 18 + 66 + 97 = 249\).
- Agent 2 values all items at a total of \(19 + 0 + 78 + 10 + 21 + 90 = 218\).
- Agent 3 values all items at a total of \(12 + 66 + 86 + 25 + 0 + 85 = 274\).
- Agent 4 values all items at a total of \(1 + 53 + 62 + 95 + 79 + 59 = 349\).

With these totals in mind, we aim to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the perceived value for each agent while distributing the items equitably.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 4** has the highest total valuation. To maximize their satisfaction, we assign them their most valued item, item 3 (value 95).

2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest (value 97). Assigning item 5 to Agent 1 maximizes their individual satisfaction.

3. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (value 86). Assigning item 2 to Agent 3 maximizes their satisfaction.

4. **Agent 0** has a strong preference for item 0 (value 85). Assigning item 0 to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.

5. **Agent 2** values item 5 highly, but since it's already allocated, we assign them item 2 (value 78), aligning with their preferences for available items.

6. **Agent 4** still has a strong valuation for item 4 (value 79). Assigning item 4 to Agent 4 complements their allocation.

After considering these assignments, let's review the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Items 3 and 4

### Final Allocation in JSON

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects individual preferences as much as possible and ensures all items are distributed among the agents.
