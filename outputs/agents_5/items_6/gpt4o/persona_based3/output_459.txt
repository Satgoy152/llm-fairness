Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  75  39  99  28  28
1   3  70  89  65  39  14
2  86  52  39   5  66  47
3  44  64  49   1  53  31
4  11  82  96  41  68  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while trying to ensure envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the highest (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the highest (89).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the highest (86).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the highest (64).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the highest (96), but since Agent 1 already values item 2 highly, let's consider other options. Agent 4's second-highest value is for item 1 (82).

Considering these preferences, we can make the following allocations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and is as satisfied as possible:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have one remaining item, item 5, which can be allocated based on secondary preferences:

- Agent 0 values item 5 as 28.
- Agent 1 values item 5 as 14.
- Agent 2 values item 5 as 47.
- Agent 3 values item 5 as 31.
- Agent 4 values item 5 as 20.

Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (47), so we assign item 5 to Agent 2.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
