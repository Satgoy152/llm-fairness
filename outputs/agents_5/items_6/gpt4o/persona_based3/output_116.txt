Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3   2   6  11  63  72
1   0  98  74  61   3  35
2  40  99  83  66  23  55
3  19  65  71  94   2   8
4  89  27  98  10  64  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to achieve a distribution where each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values items 4 and 5.
- Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 highly values items 1 and 2.
- Agent 3 highly values items 3 and 2.
- Agent 4 highly values items 0 and 2.

Given the constraints, a fair allocation can be challenging, but we can aim for a distribution that minimizes envy as much as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 values items 4 and 5 the most, and no other agent values item 5 as highly, let's allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Since agent 1 values item 1 the highest among the agents, allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 also values item 2 highly, but agent 1 already has a preferred item. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 to agent 3 as it is their most valued item.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 0 to agent 4 since it's their most valued item.

Now, we have one item left, item 4, which has a high value for agent 4. Given that agent 0 already has one of their high-value items (5), and agent 4 values item 4 significantly, allocate item 4 to agent 4.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [0, 4]

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one of their highly valued items while ensuring that all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
