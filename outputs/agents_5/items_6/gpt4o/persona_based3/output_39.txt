Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  26  83  26  28  51
1  52  90  85  82  65  58
2  51  50   3  79  11   0
3  43  46  99  38   3  39
4   5   4  51  51  42   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 90 85 82 65 58]
 [51 50  3 79 11  0]

 [ 5  4 51 51 42  2]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will use an approach that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. An envy-free allocation means that every agent feels they received at least as much value as every other agent given what was available to them.

Let's consider the valuations provided:

\[
\begin{array}{c|cccccc}
    & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
\hline
0 & 62 & 26 & 83 & 26 & 28 & 51 \\
1 & 52 & 90 & 85 & 82 & 65 & 58 \\
2 & 51 & 50 & 3 & 79 & 11 & 0 \\
3 & 43 & 46 & 99 & 38 & 3 & 39 \\
4 & 5 & 4 & 51 & 51 & 42 & 2 \\
\end{array}
\]

We will assign the items to the agents by considering their highest valuations first, trying to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items according to their preferences.

1. **Item 2:** Agent 3 values Item 2 the most at 99. Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values Item 1 the most at 90. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 3:** Agent 2 values Item 3 the most at 79. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values Item 0 the most at 62. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values Item 4 at 65, which is their second highest remaining preference. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values Item 5 at 51, which is their next highest preference remaining after Item 0. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, and no agent feels that another agent received a more favorable allocation given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```
