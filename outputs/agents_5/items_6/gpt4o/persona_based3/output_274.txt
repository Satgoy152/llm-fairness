Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  14  26  38  59  39
1  25  79   2  38  43  43
2  92  91   3  78  30  96
3  17  20  73  93  63  71
4  59  41  51  33  99  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the five agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value approximately equally, taking into account the constraints of integer allocations and the goal of minimizing envy among agents.

Here's one way to achieve a fair division:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that each agent's share of the total value is as close as possible to equal.

Let's first calculate the total value of items for each agent:

- Agent 0's total value: 37 + 14 + 26 + 38 + 59 + 39 = 213
- Agent 1's total value: 25 + 79 + 2 + 38 + 43 + 43 = 230
- Agent 2's total value: 92 + 91 + 3 + 78 + 30 + 96 = 390
- Agent 3's total value: 17 + 20 + 73 + 93 + 63 + 71 = 337
- Agent 4's total value: 59 + 41 + 51 + 33 + 99 + 81 = 364

The sum of all these values is 213 + 230 + 390 + 337 + 364 = 1534.

The goal is to allocate items such that each agent's allocation corresponds to approximately 1534/5 = 306.8 in terms of total value.

After evaluating different combinations, a viable allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 3] with a total value of 37 + 38 = 75.
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 4] with a total value of 79 + 43 = 122.
- Agent 2 gets item [5] with a total value of 96.
- Agent 3 gets item [2] with a total value of 73.
- Agent 4 gets no items.

This allocation is not perfect in terms of exact values, but it attempts to balance the allocation considering the constraint of integer numbers of items.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all six items are distributed among the agents, while trying to maintain a fair division based on their valuations.
