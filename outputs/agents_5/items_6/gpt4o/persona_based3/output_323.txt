Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  56  61  15  44  65
1  77  83  87  16  45  87
2  17  90  73   8  52  55
3   4  67  88  52  31  75
4  44  92  39  89  83  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 92 39 89 83 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, such that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations. Given the table of valuations, we can try a few strategies, such as maximizing the minimum value each agent receives or balancing the total value each agent gets.

Considering the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  56  61  15  44  65
1  77  83  87  16  45  87
2  17  90  73   8  52  55
3   4  67  88  52  31  75
4  44  92  39  89  83  89
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 1** has consistently high valuations across items 0, 1, 2, and 5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it provides a high value (87).

2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly (52) compared to others. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

4. **Agent 4** values item 4 highly (83) and also item 5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

5. **Agent 0** is left with the remaining items. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as they have low value for most items and item 0 is less valued by others.

6. **Agent 4** can also get item 5, as they have a high value for it.

### Final Allocation
Based on this strategy, here is one possible allocation that attempts to minimize envy and balance the distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items in a manner that attempts to balance the perceived fairness based on the given valuations.
