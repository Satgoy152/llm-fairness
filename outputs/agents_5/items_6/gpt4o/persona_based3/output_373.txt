Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  85  30  35  95  44
1  76  29  32  18  18  10
2   8  84  15  16  12  13
3  75  70  93  65  88   5
4  90  31  68  22  69  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and attempt to distribute them so that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, particularly when each agent values items differently, we aim to minimize envy.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 1.
   - Agent 3 highly values item 2.
   - Agent 4 highly values item 5.

2. **Initial Allocations Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Assign each agent their highest valued item to minimize potential envy.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Distribute the remaining items based on maximizing each agent's total value and minimizing the value differences to other agents' allocations.

Based on the above strategy, here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [4, 5]
- **Agent 1:** Item [0]
- **Agent 2:** Item [1]
- **Agent 3:** Item [2]
- **Agent 4:** Item [3]

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one of their higher-valued items, ensuring a more balanced distribution of value. Now let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all six items distributed among the agents.
