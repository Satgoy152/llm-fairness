Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53   6  13  56  10  65
1   8  96  28  56   6  12
2  80  21  72  35  17  95
3  68  95  86  24  94  89
4  32  37  95  48  58  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll start by examining the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that each agent feels they have a fair share relative to their own valuation.

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [53, 6, 13, 56, 10, 65]
- Agent 1: [8, 96, 28, 56, 6, 12]
- Agent 2: [80, 21, 72, 35, 17, 95]
- Agent 3: [68, 95, 86, 24, 94, 89]
- Agent 4: [32, 37, 95, 48, 58, 83]

### Strategy for Fair Allocation:
1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 1 very highly (96).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 very highly (95).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 very highly (95).
   - Agent 4 values item 2 very highly (95).

2. **Assigning High-Valued Items**:
   - Give item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Give item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Give item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Give item 2 to Agent 4.

3. **Distributing Remaining Items**:
   - Items 0 and 4 remain unallocated.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 highly (53), so give item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 4 has the next highest preference for item 4 (58), so give item 4 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, and no agent is left without any items.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation should help ensure that the agents feel they have received items that they have a significant valuation for, aiming to reduce envy across the board.
