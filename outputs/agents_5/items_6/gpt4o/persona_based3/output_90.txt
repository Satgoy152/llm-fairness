Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  16  93  91  61  90
1  73  18  43  87   3  96
2  86  90  60  41  27  77
3  22  99  54  42  13  28
4  32  14  41  61  57  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to maximize fairness by ensuring each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their individual valuation. We will use a fair division method, such as the maximum Nash welfare approach, which can help in achieving a fair allocation.

Here's a possible allocation of items to agents:

1. **Agent 0**: Maximize value by considering the items with high personal value. Items 0 and 5 are highly valued by Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 4 are relatively low value for other agents but have significant value for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 2 has a high value relative to other agents' valuations.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3 is of highest value to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: No items are left for Agent 4, ensuring at least one agent does not get any items to maximize fairness across others.

This allocation is designed to minimize envy and maximize individual satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items that maximize their valuation to the extent possible given the constraints.
