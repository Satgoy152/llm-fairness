Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  58  51  66  12  32
1  80  75  88  67  33  76
2   7  12   8   3  93  21
3  85  96  25  24  43   7
4  96   4  50  45  76  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96  4 50 45 76 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other allocation given their valuations. A simple approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) method, which maximizes the product of the utilities of the agents.

First, let's summarize the valuations for better visualization:

- Agent 0: [99, 58, 51, 66, 12, 32]
- Agent 1: [80, 75, 88, 67, 33, 76]
- Agent 2: [7, 12, 8, 3, 93, 21]
- Agent 3: [85, 96, 25, 24, 43, 7]
- Agent 4: [96, 4, 50, 45, 76, 49]

Given these preferences, we will allocate the items to maximize the MNW while striving for fairness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 0** (valued highest by Agent 0): Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1** (valued highest by Agent 3): Allocate to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2** (valued highest by Agent 1): Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3** (valued highest by Agent 0): Allocate to Agent 0 (secondary highest).
5. **Item 4** (valued highest by Agent 2): Allocate to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5** (valued highest by Agent 1): Allocate to Agent 1 (secondary highest).

### Justification:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, maximizing their utility for the items they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 5, which are highly valued by them.
- Agent 2 receives item 4, which they value the most.
- Agent 3 receives item 1, which is their highest-valued item.
- Agent 4 does not receive any items since their highest valuations are still lower compared to others' allocations, and allocating an item would reduce the overall Nash welfare.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.
