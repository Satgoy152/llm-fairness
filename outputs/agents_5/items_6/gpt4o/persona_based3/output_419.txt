Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  15  94  47  28  76
1  12   6  38  91  56  44
2  22  96  22  84  75  40
3  21  92   9  67  36  55
4  65  80  18  24   1  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy. A common approach in such problems is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, often referred to as the "maximin" solution. We will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's total allocated value is as balanced as possible.

Let's summarize the approach:

1. **Assess Valuations:** Given the table, each agent has different valuations for the items.
2. **Initial Allocation:** We'll attempt a preliminary allocation, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and aiming to balance the total value.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If necessary, adjust allocations to reduce any significant disparity in total values among agents.

### Initial Allocation

Start by assigning each agent their most valued item, if possible, and then allocate the remaining items to balance total valuation across agents.

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 2 most (94). Assign item 2.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 3 most (91). Assign item 3.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 1 most (96). Assign item 1.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 1 second most (92), but it's already taken. Assign item 5, which is their second highest value (55).
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 1 most (80), but it's already taken. Assign item 5, which is their third highest value, but item 5 is already taken by agent 3. Assign item 0, which is their second highest value (65).

### Final Allocation of Remaining Items

Now, we have assigned:
- Item 0 to Agent 4
- Item 1 to Agent 2
- Item 2 to Agent 0
- Item 3 to Agent 1
- Item 5 to Agent 3

Remaining unallocated item is 4. We will assign it to an agent to balance the valuation.

- **Item 4:** Assign to Agent 4, as it has minimal impact (only 1 value) on the overall fairness.

### Final Allocation

After this balancing act, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with efforts made to minimize disparity in total valuation received by each agent.
