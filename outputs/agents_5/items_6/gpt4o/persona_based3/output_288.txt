Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43   2  88  85  65  81
1  90  14  17  93  51   3
2  64  82  89  43  31   6
3  25  86  18  47  70  27
4  83  96  83  45  67  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will try to find an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns items to agents based on the highest relative value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialize**: Start with no items allocated to any agent.

2. **Iterate through items**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most relative to their other unallocated items, and assign it to that agent.

3. **Repeat until all items are allocated**: Continue this process until all items have been allocated.

Now, let's perform the allocation:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 1 values it the most with 90.
  - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 4 values it the most with 96.
  - Assign Item 1 to Agent 4.

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 2 values it the most with 89.
  - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 1 values it the most with 93.
  - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 3 values it the most with 70.
  - Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.

- **Item 5**: 
  - Agent 4 values it the most with 95.
  - Assign Item 5 to Agent 4.

After performing the allocation based on the highest unique value for each item, we have:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.
