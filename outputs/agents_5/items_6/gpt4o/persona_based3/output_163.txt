Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  84  78  36   5  44
1  44  20  40  21  67  68
2  70   8  56  70  59  48
3  61  61  42  90  63  33
4  42  42  39  31  78  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item and distribute the items such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
Items
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  84  78  36   5  44
1  44  20  40  21  67  68
2  70   8  56  70  59  48
3  61  61  42  90  63  33
4  42  42  39  31  78  70
```

We seek to allocate items to agents to maximize fairness and minimize envy. One approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin method where each agent selects their most valued item in turn, starting with the agent who has the lowest total valuation across all items.

However, to achieve envy-freeness, we can explore the following allocation plan:

- Agent 0: Prefers item 1 (value 84) and item 2 (value 78).
- Agent 1: Prefers item 5 (value 68).
- Agent 2: Prefers item 0 (value 70).
- Agent 3: Prefers item 3 (value 90).
- Agent 4: Prefers item 4 (value 78).

Let's allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** receives items 1 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** receives item 5.
3. **Agent 2** receives item 0.
4. **Agent 3** receives item 3.
5. **Agent 4** receives item 4.

This allocation respects each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all six items to the agents in a manner that attempts to be fair and respects each agent's preferences.
