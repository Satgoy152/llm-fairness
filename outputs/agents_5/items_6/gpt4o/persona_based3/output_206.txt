Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  74  28   1  55  51
1  78  83  18  11  51  89
2  26  32  59  49  38  55
3   7  50  47  27  14  89
4  74  17  44  68  54  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among agents based on their valuations. One approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (74). Let's assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest (89). Let's assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (59). Let's assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest but it's taken. Next highest is item 1, also taken. So assign item 3 (27).
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 the highest but it's taken. Next highest is item 0 (74). Let's assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, we have items 4 and 5 unallocated. Let's allocate them to minimize envy:

- **Item 4 (55)**: Assign to Agent 0, who values it at 55, creating a reasonably fair allocation.
- **Item 5 (89)**: Already assigned to Agent 1.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 0

This allocation tries to minimize envy by giving each agent items they value highly, given the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
