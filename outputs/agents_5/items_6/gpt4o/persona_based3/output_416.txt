Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90   6  78  12  60  98
1  90  68   8   3  43  22
2  19  29  91  27  65  82
3  13  77  19  96   7  97
4  26   7  17  63  16  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that considers envy-freeness in allocating the items among the agents, we need to evaluate the valuation matrix and try to allocate items such that each agent feels that they receive a fair share relative to their own preferences. Since each agent can get an integer number of items and there are 6 items in total, we can start by analyzing the highest valuations first and allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 the highest (98), then item 0 (90). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (90), but this conflicts with Agent 0. So, we allocate item 0 to Agent 1 since Agent 0 already has item 5.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (91), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest (96), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 (92) the highest, but it is already taken by Agent 0. The next highest value for Agent 4 is item 3 (63), which is already taken by Agent 3. We allocate item 4 (16) to Agent 4, as it is the next highest available item for them.
6. Now, item 1 remains unallocated. We review the valuations for item 1:
   - Agent 1 values it at 68, which is the highest among the remaining agents. However, Agent 1 already has item 0.
   - Next highest valuation is by Agent 3 (77), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3, who has item 3.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.

Thus, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
