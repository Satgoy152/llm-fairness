Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  25  62  89  52  24
1  87  78  70   1  57  12
2  25  12   5   3  96   3
3  58  40  33  79  76  23
4  38  27  82   8  74  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the items to agents such that envy-freeness is achieved as much as possible, given that each agent should receive an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Understand the Valuation Matrix**: Each agent has a different valuation for each item. We need to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their utility while maintaining fairness.

2. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highly, but also values item 1 significantly.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 highly.
   - Agent 3 has a reasonably high valuation for item 3 and 4.
   - Agent 4 values item 2 highly.

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, trying to ensure each agent is fairly treated with respect to their own valuations.

4. **Proposed Allocation**:
   - **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0, as it has a high valuation for them. 
   - **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1 and 5, since item 1 is the second-highest valued item for agent 1 and item 5 is least valued by other agents.
   - **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4, their highest valued item.
   - **Agent 3**: Allocate items 3, due to their relatively high valuation for it.
   - **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2, which is their highest valued item.

This allocation strives to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives items that correspond to their preferences as closely as possible within the constraints.
