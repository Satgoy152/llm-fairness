Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  75   7  74   7  98
1  56   0  36  58  66  14
2  68  43  47  50  70  91
3  97  51   7  83  91  33
4  59  18   1   6  30   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation, given their valuations. This is known as an envy-free allocation. While perfect envy-freeness may not always be possible with indivisibilities and different valuations, we can aim for a balanced distribution.

Given the valuations, one approach is to use a round-robin or similar strategy to distribute items based on each agent's preferences and valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 highly (98), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 0 (97), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 highly (70), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 1** values item 3 highly (58), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 3** values item 1 next (51), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 2** has a reasonable valuation for item 2 (47), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent based on their own valuations. Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 5.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 2.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 4 receives no items. 

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free (due to the discrete nature of items and varying valuations), but it attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the allocation.
