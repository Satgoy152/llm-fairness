Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  50  98  54  64  60
1  44  64  70  54   9   5
2  30  52  33  70  20  96
3   2  82  22  92  88  35
4  99  85  38  91  27  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. This problem can be approached using different strategies, such as maximizing the minimum value each agent receives or ensuring the distribution is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 35     | 50     | 98     | 54     | 64     | 60     |
| 1     | 44     | 64     | 70     | 54     | 9      | 5      |
| 2     | 30     | 52     | 33     | 70     | 20     | 96     |
| 3     | 2      | 82     | 22     | 92     | 88     | 35     |
| 4     | 99     | 85     | 38     | 91     | 27     | 66     |

To achieve a fair distribution, we can use the following heuristic approach:

1. **Highest Valuation First**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than one item until all agents have at least one.

2. **Balancing Strategy**: Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives a fair share, considering possible envy.

Applying this strategy:

1. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Item 0: Agent 4 (value 99)
   - Item 1: Agent 3 (value 82)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (value 98)
   - Item 3: Agent 3 (value 92)
   - Item 4: Agent 3 (value 88)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (value 96)

2. **Rebalancing for Fairness**:
   - Agent 3 received too many items initially. Redistribute items to ensure a fairer allocation.
   - Move Item 3 to Agent 4 (second highest value 91).
   - Move Item 4 to Agent 1 (who values it the least, reducing envy and balancing better).

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [2]
   - Agent 1: [4]
   - Agent 2: [5]
   - Agent 3: [1]
   - Agent 4: [0, 3]

The final allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```
