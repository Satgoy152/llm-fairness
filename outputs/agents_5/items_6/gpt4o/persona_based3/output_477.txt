Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  56  51  10   3  38
1  30  71  39  43  49  63
2  46  92  81  77  46  80
3  16  78  48  54  69  77
4   0  89  80  72   5  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their individual satisfaction while maintaining envy-freeness to the extent possible. The goal is to distribute the 6 items among the 5 agents such that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible given their valuations.

A straightforward approach is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking the item they value most highly among the remaining items. For simplicity, let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items to approximate their overall preference:

- Agent 0: 97 + 56 + 51 + 10 + 3 + 38 = 255
- Agent 1: 30 + 71 + 39 + 43 + 49 + 63 = 295
- Agent 2: 46 + 92 + 81 + 77 + 46 + 80 = 422
- Agent 3: 16 + 78 + 48 + 54 + 69 + 77 = 342
- Agent 4: 0 + 89 + 80 + 72 + 5 + 17 = 263

Based on these valuations, we can assume that agents will pick the items they value most in descending order of total valuation. This order is Agent 2, Agent 3, Agent 1, Agent 4, and Agent 0. Let's allocate the items using this order:

1. **Agent 2** picks item 1 (value = 92).
2. **Agent 3** picks item 5 (value = 77).
3. **Agent 1** picks item 4 (value = 49).
4. **Agent 4** picks item 2 (value = 80).
5. **Agent 0** picks item 0 (value = 97).
6. **Agent 2** picks item 3 (value = 77).

This allocation aims to balance the fairness by allowing agents to choose items they value highly. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```
