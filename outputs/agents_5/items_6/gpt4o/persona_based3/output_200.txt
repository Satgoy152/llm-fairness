Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  72  24  36   8  82
1  46   3  87   2  45  83
2  17  48  64  21   9   3
3  45  81  56  66  86  76
4  24  30  81  73  22  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation. We will start by evaluating each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute them to maximize fairness.

Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Identify high-value allocations** for each agent by examining the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item** if possible, based on their highest preferences.
3. **Distribute remaining items** to balance the total value among agents.

Let's look at the valuation matrix and allocate accordingly:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 5 the highest (82), so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 2 the highest (87), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 2 the highest (64), but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 1 (48), allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 4 the highest (86), so allocate item 4 to agent 3.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 2 the highest (81), but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 3 (73), allocate item 3 to agent 4.

Now, we must allocate the remaining unallocated item (0) to ensure all items are distributed:

- **Unallocated item 0:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 79.
  - Agent 1 values it at 46.
  - Agent 2 values it at 17.
  - Agent 3 values it at 45.
  - Agent 4 values it at 24.

Agent 0 values item 0 the highest among available choices, so it is fair to allocate item 0 to agent 0.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, and each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
