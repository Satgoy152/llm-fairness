Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  62  30  43  22  67
1  96  35  82  45  65  34
2  15  20  31  39  84  79
3  19  29  73  52   0  74
4  51  97   5  30  88  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we will aim to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Since there are five agents and six items, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one item each.

Let's examine some strategies to ensure fair division:

1. **Identify High-Value Allocations:** Each agent should receive at least one item they value highly to minimize envy.

2. **Balancing Across Agents:** Try to balance the total value of items each agent receives based on their valuations.

Let's proceed to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Their highest valuation is for item 0 and item 5. Since item 0 is the highest, we'll allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Their highest valuation is for item 0, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 2, so we'll allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Their highest valuation is for item 4, so we'll allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Their highest valuation is for item 5, but that's already under consideration for Agent 0. The next highest is item 3, so we'll allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Their highest valuation is for item 1, so we'll allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The remaining item is 5. Let's give item 5 to Agent 0 as well, since they originally had a high valuation for it, and this should help balance their allocation.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance high-value items among the agents and aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent gets at least one of their top-valued items.
