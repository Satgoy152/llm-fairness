Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  18   9  21  76  91
1  28  98  10  49  87  22
2  80  42  55   6  42  54
3  15   7   6  40  57  83
4  31  67  75  39  70  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to minimize envy among agents, ensuring that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Here, we will try to distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 5 highly (91), and no other agent values item 5 higher than agent 0. Assign item 5 to agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highly values item 1 (98). Assign item 1 to agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values item 0 the most (80). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value is for item 5, but it's taken. Next preference is item 4 (57). Assign item 4 to agent 3.
   
5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value for item 2 (75). Assign item 2 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, with item 3 remaining. Let's allocate it based on maximizing remaining agent satisfaction:

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (49) compared to other agents. Assign item 3 to agent 1.

This allocation minimizes envy and ensures each agent is fairly satisfied based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and overall, all 6 items are distributed among the agents.
