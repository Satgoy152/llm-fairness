Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  42  83  83  57  48
1  81  48  62  58  18  45
2  23  55   8  52  28  62
3   8  77  18  31  56  75
4  33  93  60  52  44  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations. A common method is to use a round-robin approach, where each agent picks their most valued unallocated item in turn, or we can use a method like the adjusted winner procedure. However, given the need for fairness and the discrete nature of allocations, it may not be possible to achieve perfect envy-freeness, but we can aim to minimize envy.

Below are the valuations for each agent for the 6 items:

- Agent 0: [28, 42, 83, 83, 57, 48]
- Agent 1: [81, 48, 62, 58, 18, 45]
- Agent 2: [23, 55, 8, 52, 28, 62]
- Agent 3: [8, 77, 18, 31, 56, 75]
- Agent 4: [33, 93, 60, 52, 44, 40]

An allocation strategy that tries to minimize envy and ensure each agent gets at least one item (where possible) is as follows:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued item that each agent can get without causing too much envy.
2. Then allocate remaining items considering the next highest preferences while balancing the overall allocation.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 2 and 3 equally, but since we want to balance the distribution, we can give them item 3.
- Agent 1 highly values item 0, so we allocate it to them.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most, so we allocate item 5.
- Agent 3's highest valued item is 1, so we allocate item 1.
- Agent 4's highest valued item is 1, but since it's already taken, we give them item 2, their next highest valued item.

The last unallocated item, 4, can go to Agent 3, who values it moderately and has gotten the least valued item so far.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item while trying to respect their preferences as much as possible.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
