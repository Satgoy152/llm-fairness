Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  96  28  41  64  92
1   4   3  73  72  95  12
2  95  28   5  70  57  69
3  84  90  29  28  95  76
4  84  29  37  36  18  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the problem of fairly allocating items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. However, achieving complete envy-freeness can be challenging, especially with integer allocations and a limited number of items.

Let's consider a strategy where we prioritize giving each agent their most-valued items while ensuring that every item is allocated. We can attempt to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items that have high valuations for them.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: 1 (96), 0 (93)
   - Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: 4 (95), 2 (73)
   - Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (95), 5 (69)
   - As item 0 is already allocated, we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valued items: 4 (95), 1 (90)
   - As items 4 and 1 are already allocated, no items are allocated to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valued items: 5 (83), 0 (84)
   - As item 5 is already allocated, no items are allocated to Agent 4.

After these allocations, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5. We still need to allocate item 3.

6. **Allocate item 3:**
   - Considering remaining agents (3 and 4) with no items, Agent 3 values item 3 higher than Agent 4 (Agent 3 values item 3 at 28, while Agent 4 values it at 36).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [5]
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Item [3]

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations and minimize envy, though some agents may still experience envy due to the constraints of the problem.
