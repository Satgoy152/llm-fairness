Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  66  15  99  92  62
1   0   7  30  28  27  58
2  26  95  59  54  73  27
3  93  12  33   8  33  78
4   8  74  56  37  20  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division as much as possible. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should receive a set of items that they value at least as much as any other agent's allocation, with respect to the items they could have received.

Let's consider the valuations provided and try to allocate the items so that no agent feels envious of another:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 3 with 99. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 5 with 58. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 with 95. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 0 with 93. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 2 with 56. Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we have assigned 5 items. The remaining item is 4, which needs to be allocated in a way that maintains fairness:

- **Item 4**: Valuations are:
  - Agent 0: 92
  - Agent 1: 27
  - Agent 2: 73
  - Agent 3: 33
  - Agent 4: 20
  
Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4, so we assign item 4 to Agent 0.

Now let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4, which they value at 99 and 92.
- Agent 1 receives item 5, which they value at 58.
- Agent 2 receives item 1, which they value at 95.
- Agent 3 receives item 0, which they value at 93.
- Agent 4 receives item 2, which they value at 56.

This gives each agent a set of items they value highly, reducing envy among them.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
