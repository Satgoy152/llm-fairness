Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  15  56  56  12  30
1  87   9  28  93  92   5
2   3  64  72  58  61  60
3  57  74  64  73  94  83
4  72   6  94  82  78  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[43 15 56 56 12 30]
 [87  9 28 93 92  5]
 [ 3 64 72 58 61 60]
 [57 74 64 73 94 83]
 [72  6 94 82 78 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's preferences and ensure that the allocation is as envy-free and efficient as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items belonging to another agent over their own.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most, with a valuation of 93. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 4** values item 2 the most, with a valuation of 94. Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
3. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most, with a valuation of 94. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most, with a valuation of 43. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most, with a valuation of 60. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
6. The remaining item, item 1, can be assigned to Agent 3, as they value it at 74, which is relatively high compared to the other available options.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item they value highly, minimizing envy and maximizing fairness.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
