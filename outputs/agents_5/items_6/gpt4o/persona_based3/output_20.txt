Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  29  22  19  87  76
1  24  41  91  94  23   9
2  50  75  81   7  31  40
3   7  17  67  79  73  41
4  26   8  12   3   6  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness where possible, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given that we have 5 agents and 6 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll try to balance the allocation by considering the agents' valuations.

First, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 99.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 94.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 81.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 79, but it is already highly valued by Agent 1.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest at 75.

We will start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item, if possible, and then allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 99)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 94)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 2 (value 81)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 4 (value 73)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 5 (value 75)

Now, we have only one item left, which is item 1. We will allocate item 1 to the agent who would benefit the most from it in terms of increasing their overall valuation.

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 29.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 41.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 75.
- Agent 3 values item 1 at 17.
- Agent 4 values item 1 at 8.

Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 75, so we will allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and aims to minimize envy among the agents based on their valuations.
