Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71   9  24  52  39  10
1  18  10  11  66  28  91
2  48  19  55  37  31  41
3  91  81  93  61  46  20
4  31  77  14   0  74  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to allocate items such that envy-freeness is maintained as much as possible, considering the individual valuations. Given there are 5 agents and 6 items, some agents will receive more items than others, but we will try to distribute them to maximize fairness based on the provided valuations.

Here's a potential allocation that takes into account the preferences of the agents:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly, so it makes sense to allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly, making it a good candidate for allocation to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

This leaves item 4 unallocated. We need to allocate item 4 to one of the agents. Based on the remaining valuations, Agent 4 values item 4 the most compared to other agents, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring each item is allocated.
