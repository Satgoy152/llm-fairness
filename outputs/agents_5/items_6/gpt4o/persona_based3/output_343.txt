Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  43  99  40  30  25
1  11  36  84  26  47  44
2  82  71  71  59  78  26
3  74  55   4  76  54  65
4  61  42  90  81  54  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use principles from fair division, aiming for envy-freeness and ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the preferences of the agents, we will try to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation while keeping the distribution as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 1 has high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 2 has high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 3 has high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 4 has high valuation for item 2.

Given the constraints and the goal of achieving an envy-free distribution as much as possible, we'll assign items based on maximizing individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. 

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 since they value it the most.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 as they have the second-highest valuation for it, and this balances their total value.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since they have the highest valuation among those who haven't received an item yet.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 since they value it the highest.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 since they value it the most and haven't received an item yet.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 4 since they value it highly and haven't received an item yet.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and we attempt to maximize individual satisfaction as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
