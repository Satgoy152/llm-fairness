Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  72  55  82  17   5
1  78  63  53  66  50  94
2   7   6  57   6  81  61
3  24  30  10  75   2  75
4  71  41   3  30  60  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for envy-freeness and efficiency. Let's analyze the valuations and determine an allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, while minimizing envy as much as possible.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 3.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest.
- Agent 3 values items 3 and 5 the highest.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest.

Let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 1 (valuations: 69, 72).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (valuation: 94).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (valuation: 81).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 (valuation: 75).
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 2 (valuation: 3).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 2

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation should be reasonably fair and efficient given the valuations, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.
