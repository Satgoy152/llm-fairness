Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  90  93  80   9  97
1  87  97  12  55  82  56
2  60  92  82  87  20  40
3  54  41  13  45  95  79
4  43  18  90  23   4  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution as much as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocated items are at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations matrix, we can proceed with a strategy that seeks to minimize envy by assigning items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this the most at 87. Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this the most at 97. Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this the most at 93. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values this the most at 87. Assign to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values this the most at 95. Assign to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values this the most at 97. Assign to Agent 0.

This allocation considers the highest valuation for each item while trying to distribute items fairly among the agents.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while attempting to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.
