Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  91  58   2  19   9
1  49  22  80  83  70  18
2   4  78  41  19  11  32
3   3  47  51  93  34  50
4  51   1  87  75  36  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we should aim to reduce envy among the agents. A common approach is to use the "envy-free" criterion, which ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the valuations provided, we can attempt to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible according to their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 1 the most (valuation 91). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 3 the most (valuation 83). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 1 the most, but it's already taken. The next best is item 5 (valuation 32). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 3 the most, but it's already taken. The next best is item 4 (valuation 34). Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 5 the most, but it's already taken. The next best is item 2 (valuation 87). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and item 0 is left. We will allocate item 0 to the agent who benefits most from it and has the least valuable allocation so far.

- **Agent 1** has the least valuable allocation from their perspective with item 3 (valuation 83). Item 0 has a valuation of 49 for Agent 1, which improves their total utility.

Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuation, ensuring that no agent feels significantly envious of another's allocation.
