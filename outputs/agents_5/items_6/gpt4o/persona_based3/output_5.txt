Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  77  71  25  18  15
1  87  21  21  41  69  12
2  53  18  25  61   2  35
3   5  77  31  21  89  14
4   4  64  10  90  23  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's total value for their allocated items. Given the valuations, we can use an algorithmic approach such as a computational fair division method to optimize the allocations. Here is one possible allocation that seeks to achieve this goal:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are items 1 and 2, but considering envy-freeness and the requirement to allocate items fairly, we allocate:
   - Item 0 with value 25
   - Item 1 with value 77

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 0, but it's already allocated, so we choose:
   - Item 4 with value 69
   - Item 3 with value 41

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 3, but it's already allocated, so we choose:
   - Item 5 with value 35

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 4, but it's already allocated, so we choose:
   - Item 2 with value 31

5. **Agent 4**: The remaining item is:
   - Item 3 with value 90

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets at least one item except Agent 0, who gets the highest-valued item for them, and the total number of items allocated is 6.
