Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  66  54   2  14  90
1  39  89  72  70  63  12
2  55  13  78  68  91  58
3  64  83  71  33  78  20
4  12   2  83  61   3  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their individual valuations while attempting to maintain envy-freeness. Envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the table of valuations, we will allocate the items in a way that tries to respect these principles. 

We will utilize an algorithmic approach to assign items, such as the "round-robin" method, where each agent picks their most valued unallocated item sequentially until all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how this might be done:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 5 (value 90).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 1 (value 89).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 4 (value 91).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 0 (value 64).
5. **Agent 4** picks item 2 (value 83).
6. **Agent 0** (next in the sequence) picks item 3 (value 2).

These selections are based on the highest valuation each agent has for the remaining items during their turn. Here is the allocation based on this sequence:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation method distributes all 6 items among the 5 agents. Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation attempts to maximize individual satisfaction based on the given valuations.
