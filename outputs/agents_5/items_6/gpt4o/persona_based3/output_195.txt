Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  23  58  21  60  90
1  11   1  76  92  84  84
2  65  15  78  17  54  42
3  76  17  88  90  24  46
4  32  18  73  94  10  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

To start, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 27 + 23 + 58 + 21 + 60 + 90 = 279
- Agent 1: 11 + 1 + 76 + 92 + 84 + 84 = 348
- Agent 2: 65 + 15 + 78 + 17 + 54 + 42 = 271
- Agent 3: 76 + 17 + 88 + 90 + 24 + 46 = 341
- Agent 4: 32 + 18 + 73 + 94 + 10 + 26 = 253

Next, we aim to allocate each item to maximize the fairness and minimize envy. We will distribute items based on the highest valuations while trying to maintain balance among the agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 4 (highest valuation for item 3)
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for item 0)
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 2)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for item 5)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (second-highest available for item 4)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for item 1)

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations, thereby striving for an envy-free distribution.

The final allocations in the given JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```
