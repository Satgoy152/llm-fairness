Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  50  77  50  79   8
1  68   2   9  43  53  95
2  95   2  88  82  20  78
3  69  25  39  71  90  98
4  74  11  42  10  41   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to minimize envy among agents. One approach is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion which tries to ensure that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own based on their valuation.

Let's consider the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0 and 4 (79 each). We allocate item 0 and item 4 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 5 (95). Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (95), but it's already taken by agent 0. Next highest is item 2 (88). Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for item 5 (98) and item 4 (90), which are both already taken. Next highest is item 3 (71). Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Remaining item is item 1. Allocate item 1 to agent 4.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to one agent and aims to reduce envy by assigning items based on high valuations while keeping the distribution fair.
