Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  87  82  87  55  22
1  36   0  31  76  65  91
2  55  15  47  14  10  10
3  14  90  77  76  49   2
4  21  45  84  85  75  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and only 6 items are available, we can consider different possible allocations to achieve a fair distribution.

Here is one potential allocation considering the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0, among others. 
   - Allocation: [0]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5. 
   - Allocation: [5]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values items relatively lower than others, but item 2 is more valuable for them. 
   - Allocation: [2]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 highly values item 1. 
   - Allocation: [1]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 highly values items 3 and 4, and they can get both since they have the highest cumulative valuation for these remaining items.
   - Allocation: [3, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed in a way that respects the relative valuations, minimizing envy among the agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and attempts to minimize envy by distributing items according to the agents' preferences.
