Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  82  99  28  33  51
1  81  49  78  26  39  23
2   9  62  41   6   7  24
3  25  31  74   6   8  53
4  58  49  50  80  98  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels that they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations. The goal is to minimize envy, which occurs when an agent values another agent's allocation more than their own.

Given the following valuations matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 62     | 82     | 99     | 28     | 33     | 51     |
| 1     | 81     | 49     | 78     | 26     | 39     | 23     |
| 2     | 9      | 62     | 41     | 6      | 7      | 24     |
| 3     | 25     | 31     | 74     | 6      | 8      | 53     |
| 4     | 58     | 49     | 50     | 80     | 98     | 99     |

We need to allocate the 6 items to the 5 agents. Let's attempt to do so:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (value 99), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 4 and 5 (values 98 and 99), significantly more than others, so we assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 4.
3. **Agent 1** values item 0 (value 81) the most, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 2** doesn't have very high valuations, but item 1 (value 62) is highest for them, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 3** will receive the remaining item, item 3 (value 6), which doesn't cause much envy since it is generally less valued.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and it tries to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one of their most valued items.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
