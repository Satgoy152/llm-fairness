Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  54  51  64  86  55
1  54  69  16   8  63  74
2  57  44  37  52  36  35
3  61  19  41  77  74  90
4   0  89  40  56  85  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the sum of values each agent receives while ensuring envy-freeness, if possible. Envy-freeness is a condition where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the nature of integer allocations and limited items, perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable, but we will attempt to reach a fair distribution based on the valuations provided.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are highest for item 4. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are highest for item 5. Assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are highest for item 0. Assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are highest for item 3. Assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are highest for item 1. Assign item 1 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining item:

6. The remaining item is item 2. It has varying values, but to maintain fairness based on the remaining choices and to ensure all agents are considered, assign item 2 to agent 3, who has a reasonable valuation for it and hasn't received a highly valued item yet.

Final allocations based on the above strategy:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items among the agents based on their individual valuations, while ensuring all items are distributed.
