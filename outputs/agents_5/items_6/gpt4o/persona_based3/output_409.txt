Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  53   7  94  97  95
1  15  19  42  32  60  56
2   8  86  54  93  56  37
3  69  71  99  14  64  94
4  76  88  21   5  43  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution. This method aims to maximize the product of the agents' utilities, which tends to produce allocations that are both efficient and fair.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value:** First, calculate each agent's total valuation for all items.
   - Agent 0: 52 + 53 + 7 + 94 + 97 + 95 = 398
   - Agent 1: 15 + 19 + 42 + 32 + 60 + 56 = 224
   - Agent 2: 8 + 86 + 54 + 93 + 56 + 37 = 334
   - Agent 3: 69 + 71 + 99 + 14 + 64 + 94 = 411
   - Agent 4: 76 + 88 + 21 + 5 + 43 + 52 = 285

2. **Begin Allocation Process:**
   - Assign items in a way that maximizes their marginal utility to each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them (97).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3, who values it highly (69) compared to others.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it has a high value for them (93).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1, who values it significantly (56).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 4, who values it highly (88).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3, who values it the most (99).

### Final Allocation:

The allocation of items to agents is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.
