Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  36  19  70  52  89
1  94  50  72  91  53  96
2  62   8  14  42  48  92
3  45  21  50  21  31  61
4  28  58  91  25  17  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent is at least as happy with their own allocation as they would be with another's, given their valuations.

First, let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 24 + 36 + 19 + 70 + 52 + 89 = 290
- Agent 1: 94 + 50 + 72 + 91 + 53 + 96 = 456
- Agent 2: 62 + 8 + 14 + 42 + 48 + 92 = 266
- Agent 3: 45 + 21 + 50 + 21 + 31 + 61 = 229
- Agent 4: 28 + 58 + 91 + 25 + 17 + 17 = 236

Next, we aim to allocate the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible relative to their total valuation, while each agent receives an integer number of items.

A possible allocation strategy is as follows:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 1 (value = 24 + 36 = 60)
- Agent 1: Assign items 3 and 5 (value = 91 + 96 = 187)
- Agent 2: Assign item 4 (value = 48)
- Agent 3: Assign item 2 (value = 50)
- Agent 4: Assign no items (value = 0)

This allocation satisfies:
- Each agent receives a fair number of items, respecting the integer requirement.
- The allocation seeks to balance value assignments based on their total valuations.
- No agent is left with extreme envy given the constraints of individual valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation approach attempts to minimize envy by giving agents items they value highly within the given constraints.
