Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66   8   1  31   2  30
1  95  88  10  77  61   1
2  58  66  48  56  25  63
3  49  62  84  80  33  40
4  59  47  14  27  45  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, considering the valuations provided. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity and constraints, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, but we can aim for a fair and reasonable distribution.

Let's evaluate each agent's preferences and try to allocate items to balance the total value received by each agent while considering their valuations:

1. **Agent 0** seems to value item 0 the most.
2. **Agent 1** has a strong preference for items 0, 1, and 3.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 2.
5. **Agent 4** seems to have more balanced lower valuations, but item 0 is valued the highest.

Considering these preferences, a fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value = 66)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 3 (values = 88 and 77)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (value = 63)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (value = 84)
- **Agent 4**: Item 4 (value = 45)

This allocation respects the highest valuations and distributes the items in a way that attempts to minimize envy.

Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, with a focus on maximizing the total perceived value for each agent based on their preferences.
