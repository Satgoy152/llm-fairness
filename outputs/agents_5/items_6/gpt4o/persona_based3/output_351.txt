Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  22  43  84  73  24
1  55  78  96  60  11  80
2  92  61   3   5  23  37
3  13  32  21  62  78  85
4  44  11   6  31  83  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives a combination of items such that they prefer their allocation over others, or at least are not envious of others' allocations.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 3. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0, but since it's already assigned, we give item 1 to Agent 2, which is their next highest value.
4. **Agent 3:** Agent 3 highly values item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Agent 4 values item 4 the most. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

This allocation attempts to give each agent one of their most valued items to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items and all 6 items are distributed.
