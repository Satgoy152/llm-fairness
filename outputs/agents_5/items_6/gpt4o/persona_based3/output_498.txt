Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  36  56  61  82  57
1  92  19  31  91  28  26
2  10  23  15   1  46  79
3  29  39  72  53  35  12
4  97  55  47  17  12  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim for an envy-free or as close to envy-free distribution as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their share of items is at least as valuable, in their own estimation, as any other agent's share.

Given the valuations:

```
0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  36  56  61  82  57
1  92  19  31  91  28  26
2  10  23  15   1  46  79
3  29  39  72  53  35  12
4  97  55  47  17  12  24
```

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual valuations.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, to adhere to fairness considerations.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (value 82)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 92)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (value 79)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (value 72)
- **Agent 4**: Item 1 (value 55), Item 3 (value 17)

The proposed allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution aims to consider each agent's highest-valued item first while also considering the total number of items to be allocated.

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed (six items in total), and each agent receives items according to their valuations.
