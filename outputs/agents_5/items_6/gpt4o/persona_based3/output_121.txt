Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76   8  22  38  84  93
1  13  22  58   2  31  12
2  97  68  73  33   9  97
3  19  55  51  77   0  38
4  68  72  75  41  76  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness and perhaps approximate it with the current framework since achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations and discrete items can be complex. Here, we will perform a distribution aiming to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. 

Let's examine the valuations and find an allocation that seems reasonably fair:

- Agent 0: Values items highly at indices [0, 4, 5].
- Agent 1: Has a moderate valuation for item 2.
- Agent 2: Values items highly at indices [0, 2, 5].
- Agent 3: Has moderate valuations across many items, but highest for item 3.
- Agent 4: Values items highly at indices [2, 4, 5].

Considering the above and aiming for a fair allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, who values it the most (97).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 4, who has a reasonable valuation for it (72).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, who values it the most (58) after Agent 2.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 3, who values it the most (77).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, who values it the most (84).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 4, who values it highly (96).

Now, letâ€™s present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations each agent receives, given the constraints of integer allocations and discrete items.
