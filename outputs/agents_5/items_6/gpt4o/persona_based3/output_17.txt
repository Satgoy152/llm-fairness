Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  35  52  10   3  31
1  16  24  89  81  98  69
2  10  76  64  64  51  86
3  93  72  79  70  96  84
4  51  21  25  83  75   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we will focus on achieving an envy-free allocation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent to their own. Given the differing valuations, achieving envy-freeness might be challenging, but we will aim to distribute the items in a manner that minimizes envy.

First, let's examine the total value each agent assigns to all items to get an overall sense of their preferences:

- Agent 0: 81 + 35 + 52 + 10 + 3 + 31 = 212
- Agent 1: 16 + 24 + 89 + 81 + 98 + 69 = 377
- Agent 2: 10 + 76 + 64 + 64 + 51 + 86 = 351
- Agent 3: 93 + 72 + 79 + 70 + 96 + 84 = 494
- Agent 4: 51 + 21 + 25 + 83 + 75 + 5 = 260

Now, let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

1. **Agent 3** has the highest total valuation. To minimize envy, let's try to give them high-value items they value significantly.
   - Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 3. (Values: 93, 96)

2. **Agent 1** has the second highest total valuation.
   - Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 1. (Values: 89, 81)

3. **Agent 2** values item 5 highly and has a relatively high total valuation.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2. (Value: 86)

4. **Agent 0** and **Agent 4** have lower total valuations. We'll assign the remaining item to minimize their envy.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0. (Value: 35)

Now, let's check the allocations and ensure we've assigned all 6 items:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Items 0, 4
- Agent 4: No items

This allocation distributes all items and aims to minimize envy. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": []
}
```
