Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  11  48  31  87  77
1  79  93  17  18  60  91
2  44  18  75   1   8  40
3  64  56  10  44  91  71
4  76  33  45  27  41  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to follow a round-robin selection process or use algorithms such as the adjusted winner procedure to minimize envy. Given the small number of items and agents, an intuitive approach is feasible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Highest value for item 4 (87)
- Agent 1: Highest value for item 1 (93)
- Agent 2: Highest value for item 2 (75)
- Agent 3: Highest value for item 4 (91) after Agent 0
- Agent 4: Highest value for item 0 (76)

Considering these preferences, a possible allocation to minimize envy could be:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (87 is the highest valuation for them).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (93 is the highest valuation for them).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (75 is the highest valuation for them).
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (71 is the second-highest available valuation for them).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (76 is the highest available valuation for them).

Now, we are left with item 3 unallocated. We should assign it to the agent who values it the most among those who have not yet received their high-value items:

6. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (44 is the highest available valuation after item 5).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with the goal of reducing envy based on their highest value preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
