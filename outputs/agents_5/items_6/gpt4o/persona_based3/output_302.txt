Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  60  90  70  63  27
1  48  45  79  46  26  10
2  74  18  48  50  85   0
3  99  17  89  10  34  10
4  89  24  97  93  42  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a fair manner while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels that another agent is significantly better off with their allocation.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  60  90  70  63  27
1  48  45  79  46  26  10
2  74  18  48  50  85   0
3  99  17  89  10  34  10
4  89  24  97  93  42  95
```

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most with a value of 90.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most but it is second highest with a value of 79, the next is item 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most with a value of 85.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most with a value of 99.
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 the most with a value of 97.

By focusing on the highest valuations and ensuring that each agent receives items without causing significant envy:

- Assign item 0 to agent 3, because they value it the highest.
- Assign item 2 to agent 4, because they value it the highest.
- Assign item 4 to agent 2, because they value it the highest.
- Assign item 3 to agent 0, as it is the next highest for them without causing conflicts.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1, as it is the next available highest for them.
- Assign item 5 to agent 4, as they have a relatively high valuation for it after item 2.

By doing this allocation, we aim to balance the distribution fairly based on individual valuations, minimizing envy.

Here are the allocations in the specified json format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```
