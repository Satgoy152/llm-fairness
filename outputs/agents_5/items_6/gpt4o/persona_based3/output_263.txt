Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81   3  62  23  11  82
1  33  26  74  47  85  85
2  97  17  89  29  62  56
3  85  26   4  80  68  55
4  76  63  40  85  35  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or at least minimize envy, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Given the valuations, we will use an approach that attempts to balance the value each agent receives.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Look for items that have significantly higher valuations for certain agents and allocate those items to those agents to maximize their utility.

2. **Balance Remaining Items:** Allocate the remaining items by trying to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their valuations for the remaining items.

Let's see how this can be done:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (value 82) and item 0 (value 81).
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (value 85) and item 5 (value 85).
- Agent 2 highly values item 0 (value 97).
- Agent 3 highly values item 3 (value 80).
- Agent 4 has moderate values across items.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value for this item).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (shares the highest value with Agent 0, but Agent 0 can be satisfied with item 2).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (highest value for this item).
- Allocate item 1 and item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest values for these items).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 4 (no items yet, moderate value for this item).

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with items and attempts to maximize each agent's utility based on their individual valuations.
