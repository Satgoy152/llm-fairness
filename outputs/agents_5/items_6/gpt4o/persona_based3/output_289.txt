Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  51  93  45  92  58
1  13  79  62  99  40  95
2  83  78  61  41  19  97
3   5  11  92  93  97  15
4  84  16  26  40  50  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while considering the valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an approach that balances the total value each agent receives. One common strategy involves maximizing the minimum value received by any agent. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation process based on the given valuations:

### Step 1: Initial Observations
- There are 6 items and 5 agents. 
- Each agent should receive at least 1 item, with one agent possibly receiving 2 items.

### Step 2: Calculate Valuations
- Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their preferences.
- Assign items to agents such that each agent's total valuation is maximized or at least balanced to reduce envy.

### Step 3: Allocate Items
1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 2 and 4. Assign item 4 (value 92) to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 3. Assign item 3 (value 99) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 5. Assign item 5 (value 97) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 4 but it's taken. Next best is item 3. Assign item 2 (value 92) to Agent 3 as item 3 is taken.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 0. Assign item 0 (value 84) to Agent 4.

### Step 4: Assign Remaining Item
- Item 1 remains unallocated. 
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they initially have an item of lower total value (51) compared to others.

### Allocations
The allocations based on the above discussion are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure a fair distribution where each agent receives at least one item, and the division considers maximizing the value each agent receives.
