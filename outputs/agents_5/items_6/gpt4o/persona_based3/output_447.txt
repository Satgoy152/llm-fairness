Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  63  71  84  76  97
1  59  87  84  35  84  58
2  56  31  18  75  91  95
3   6  67  83   6  18  25
4  74   4  50  25  70  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent gets an integer number of items, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's consider the following approach:
1. Calculate the sum of valuations for each agent.
2. Aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their total valuation.

The sum of valuations for each agent is:
- Agent 0: 414
- Agent 1: 407
- Agent 2: 366
- Agent 3: 205
- Agent 4: 281

Given that there are 6 items and 5 agents, we need to ensure each agent gets approximately their proportionate value share. We'll allocate items initially based on which agent values them most and then adjust to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (97), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (87), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (91), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (83), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (74), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
- The remaining item is 3. Agent 0 values it the most after item 5, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the items are distributed based on the agents' highest valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
