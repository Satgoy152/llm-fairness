Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98   0  55  72  99  57
1  10  28  18  22  26  38
2  21  29  43  81  21  87
3   8  11  63   1  20  21
4  81  41  88   3  11  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the five agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we must consider the individual valuations and try to ensure that each agent feels they receive a fair share. Given the constraints, we will focus on maximizing each agent's satisfaction and trying to achieve a balance among the agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 4. Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has relatively low valuations compared to others, so we aim to give them items that don't significantly impact others' satisfaction. Allocating item 5 to Agent 1 suits this goal.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most, so assigning item 3 to Agent 2 maximizes their happiness.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 highly, so giving them item 2 is appropriate.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 1 more than the others, so we allocate item 1 to them.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution considers their preferences to some extent.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
