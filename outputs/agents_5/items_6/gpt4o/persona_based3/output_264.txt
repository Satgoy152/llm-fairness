Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  75   4   2  50  93
1  31  46  13  34   1  47
2  83  13  28  21  52  60
3  58  86  71  87  32  10
4  91   1  49  16  36  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin or a similar method that considers each agent's highest-valued available item in turn.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 5 (value 93). Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 5 (value 47), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 1 (value 46). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 0 (value 83). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 3 (value 87). Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is item 0 (value 91), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 5 (value 51), but it's also allocated. The next highest is item 2 (value 49). Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Now we've allocated 5 items. We have one item remaining to allocate:

6. **Remaining Item 4**: The remaining item is 4, with values: Agent 0 (50), Agent 1 (1), Agent 2 (52), Agent 3 (32), Agent 4 (36). The highest value for item 4 is for Agent 2 (value 52). However, Agent 2 already has an item. To ensure each agent gets at least one item, consider assigning item 4 to another agent who doesn't have an item yet. Since Agent 4 only has one item, we can assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
