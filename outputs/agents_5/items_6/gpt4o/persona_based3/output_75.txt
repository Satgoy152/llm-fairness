Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  61  76  41  22  48
1  71  69  78   7  36  83
2  93  90  91  50  11   7
3  23  20  35  43  89  81
4  44  70  89  92  20  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items such that the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. Here, each agent should receive an integer number of items, and all 6 items must be allocated in total.

Analyzing the valuation matrix, we'll aim to maximize the total utility by allocating items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Let's go through the allocation process step-by-step:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 93.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 2 also values item 1 the most at 90.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most at 91.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 4 values item 3 the most at 92.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 4.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 3 values item 4 the most at 89.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 3.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most at 83.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

This allocation gives each item to the agent who values it the most and ensures all items are allocated. Agent 0 receives no items in this allocation.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 1, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the utility for each item based on the agents' preferences while ensuring that all items are distributed.
