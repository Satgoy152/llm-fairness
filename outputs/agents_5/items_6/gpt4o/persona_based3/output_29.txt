Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  34  58  47  54   0
1  32  65  20  86  97  29
2  73  11  46  39  80  34
3  74  82   8   5  61  31
4  74  64  84  94  83  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. A common approach to achieve fairness is to aim for an "envy-free" allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

One common method for achieving such an allocation is to use a round-robin or sequential allocation process, where each agent takes turns selecting their most-preferred item that is still available. This doesn't always yield a perfectly envy-free allocation, but it is a practical heuristic for many scenarios.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  34  58  47  54   0
1  32  65  20  86  97  29
2  73  11  46  39  80  34
3  74  82   8   5  61  31
4  74  64  84  94  83  90
```

We can use a round-robin allocation based on the highest valuations first. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 4** selects item 3 (value 94).
2. **Agent 1** selects item 4 (value 97).
3. **Agent 3** selects item 1 (value 82).
4. **Agent 2** selects item 0 (value 73).
5. **Agent 0** selects item 2 (value 58).
6. **Agent 4** selects item 5 (value 90) since it's the highest remaining value for them.

Now let's check if the allocation is envy-free. Each agent has picked their most preferred available item in their turn, reducing envy.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects the integer requirement and assigns all 6 items.
