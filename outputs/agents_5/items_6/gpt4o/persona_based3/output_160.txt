Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  18  94  69  69  22
1  63  47  75  99  61  83
2  67  15  74  88  12  93
3  72  49  63  12  15  85
4  33  47  57  44  72  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for a division that considers the valuations of the agents and tries to achieve fairness criteria like envy-freeness, although achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging with indivisible goods like these.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 65, 18, 94, 69, 69, 22
Agent 1: 63, 47, 75, 99, 61, 83
Agent 2: 67, 15, 74, 88, 12, 93
Agent 3: 72, 49, 63, 12, 15, 85
Agent 4: 33, 47, 57, 44, 72, 16
```

We will try to allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent while considering a balanced distribution. The goal is to ensure each agent feels their allocation is fair compared to others.

### Allocation Process

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: Each agent should ideally get an item they value highly.
2. **Ensure all items are allocated**: All 6 items should be distributed among the 5 agents.

### Proposed Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (Value: 94)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (Value: 99)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (Value: 93)
- **Agent 3**: Item 0 (Value: 72)
- **Agent 4**: Items 1 and 4 (Values: 47, 72)

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one of their higher-valued items, and though it may not be perfectly envy-free, it optimizes individual agent utility given the constraints of indivisibility.
