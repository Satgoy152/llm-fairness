Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  33  26  11  67  39
1  49  55  78  42  51  19
2  28  97  10  51  62  84
3  57  25  97  26  40  31
4  97  18  52  37  92  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free division where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their individual valuations. This can be challenging, especially when the number of items is less than or equal to the number of agents, but we will attempt to approximate this as closely as possible.

Here is the valuation matrix for clarity:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 74     | 33     | 26     | 11     | 67     | 39     |
| 1     | 49     | 55     | 78     | 42     | 51     | 19     |
| 2     | 28     | 97     | 10     | 51     | 62     | 84     |
| 3     | 57     | 25     | 97     | 26     | 40     | 31     |
| 4     | 97     | 18     | 52     | 37     | 92     | 77     |

To allocate the items, we will try to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is by agent 4 (97).
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is by agent 2 (97).
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is by agent 3 (97).
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is by agent 2 (51).
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is by agent 4 (92).
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is by agent 2 (84).

To maintain balance, let's adjust the allocations so each agent receives a fair share, considering both high value and distribution:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (high value for agent 4, but agent 4 can still get a high total value from other items).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (high value for agent 3, but agent 3 can get a high total from item 3).
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 5 (high value for agent 2 on both, and this balances their allocation).
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (high value for agent 2, but agent 2 has already been allocated high-value items).
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (high value for agent 4).

This allocation gives agents a fair distribution where each receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items based on the agents' valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item with significant value to them wherever possible.
