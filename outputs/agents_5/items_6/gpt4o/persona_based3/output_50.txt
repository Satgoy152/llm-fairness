Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90   7  41  27  73  25
1  56  65  11  81  35  29
2  27   9  42  51  34  89
3  59  98  46  47  11  53
4  61  84  75  14   6  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common goal in fair division is to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, which means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Based on the valuations provided, here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:**
   - Each agent has a different valuation for each item. We should identify which items are highly valued by each agent to try and satisfy their preferences.

2. **Allocate Items Strategically:**
   - We aim to allocate items to agents such that no agent feels envious of another. This typically involves ensuring that each agent receives at least one item that they highly value.

3. **Ensure Completeness and Disjoint Allocation:**
   - All items must be allocated, and each item can only be assigned to one agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly at 90. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 81. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly at 89. Assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly at 98. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly at 75. Assign item 2 to agent 4.

This leaves item 4 unallocated. Let's distribute it to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 values item 4 at 73, which is relatively high compared to other agents' valuations of this item. Assign item 4 to agent 0.

Our final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 2

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
