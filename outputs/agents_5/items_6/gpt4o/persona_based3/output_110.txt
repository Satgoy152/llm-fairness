Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  36  90  21  83  88
1  82   7  67  11  67  57
2   5  89  49  67  27  42
3   1  28  39  24  52  80
4  61  16  34  84  81  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to find an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the constraints, we need to ensure that each agent's allocation is as close to envy-freeness as possible. 

One heuristic approach is to allocate items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations. We will follow a strategy where each item is given to the agent who values it the most. This approach doesn't guarantee complete envy-freeness but often results in allocations that are perceived as fair.

Here's the step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Valuations: [9, 82, 5, 1, 61]
   - Agent 1 values it the highest (82).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Valuations: [36, 7, 89, 28, 16]
   - Agent 2 values it the highest (89).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Valuations: [90, 67, 49, 39, 34]
   - Agent 0 values it the highest (90).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Valuations: [21, 11, 67, 24, 84]
   - Agent 4 values it the highest (84).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Valuations: [83, 67, 27, 52, 81]
   - Agent 0 values it the highest (83). However, to ensure fairness and because Agent 0 already has item 2, let's consider the next highest valuation.
   - Agent 4 values it the second highest (81).

6. **Item 5**:
   - Valuations: [88, 57, 42, 80, 18]
   - Agent 0 values it the highest (88).

With this allocation strategy, we have:

- Agent 0: 2, 5
- Agent 1: 0
- Agent 2: 1
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: 3, 4

Now, here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
