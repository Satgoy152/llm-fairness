Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  21  50  21  40  22
1  77  74  28  62  66  19
2  54  42  53  70  53  40
3  67  71  74  85  36   0
4  51  33  91  90  29  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the maximum envy-free allocation or a similar heuristic that tries to balance the perceived value each agent receives. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent** and try to allocate them in a way that maximizes each agent's total perceived value.

2. **Distribute remaining items** to balance total value perceived by each agent, ensuring no agent envies another.

Let's consider a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (50), so we assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (77), so we assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (70), so we assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the most (85), but since item 3 is already assigned to Agent 2, we consider their second-highest value, which is item 2 or item 0. Since item 4 has not been allocated and is of reasonable value to Agent 3, assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most (91), but since item 2 is already allocated, we assign their next highest value item 5 (82) to Agent 4.

Now, only item 1 remains unallocated. Let's assign it to Agent 0, who had their highest value item taken by another agent, to balance their envy.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [2, 1]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [5]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of item values across agents, minimizing envy and ensuring each agent gets at least one item they value highly.
