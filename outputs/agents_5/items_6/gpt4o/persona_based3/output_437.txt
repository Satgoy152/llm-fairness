Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  62  75  14  71  35
1  74  37   0  38  75  57
2  93  68  79  78   8  29
3  61  99  90   5  29  44
4  69  48   7  88  57   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 37  0 38 75 57]
 [93 68 79 78  8 29]

 [69 48  7 88 57  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to aim for an envy-free distribution. An envy-free distribution ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  62  75  14  71  35
1  74  37   0  38  75  57
2  93  68  79  78   8  29
3  61  99  90   5  29  44
4  69  48   7  88  57   1
```

We can proceed with the allocation by considering each agentâ€™s highest valued items and ensuring each item is assigned once.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest (93). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest (99). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 3** values item 2 significantly (90). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest (88). Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
5. **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest (71). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest (57). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

This allocation aims to give each agent their most valued available item, minimizing envy among agents.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation respects the condition of allocating exactly 6 items in total.
