Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  89  67  26  46
1  87  64  86  11  89
2  94  98  72  45  22
3  86  26  68  67  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy, which means each agent should be as satisfied as possible with their allocation relative to others. One common approach to achieve this is using the idea of maximizing the minimum utility, ensuring each agent gets at least as much value as possible based on their preferences.

Here are the steps involved in finding a fair allocation:

1. **List the total valuations for each agent**:  
   - Agent 0: 54 + 89 + 67 + 26 + 46 = 282
   - Agent 1: 87 + 64 + 86 + 11 + 89 = 337
   - Agent 2: 94 + 98 + 72 + 45 + 22 = 331
   - Agent 3: 86 + 26 + 68 + 67 + 73 = 320

2. **Allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction**:  
   We should aim to allocate items by maximizing individual preferences and trying to ensure each agent gets a fair share of their total valuations.

3. **Determine allocations**:  
   - Start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most.
   - Ensure that each agent ends up with approximately equal total valuation, if possible.

Following this method, we can derive an allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 94).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 98).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 86).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 67).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 89).

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives no items, but this helps minimize overall envy given the constraints.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4, which maximizes their utility.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1, which are their highest valued items.
- Agent 3 receives item 3, which is a reasonably valued item for them. 

This allocation attempts to balance the total utility received by each agent, given the limitations and preferences.
