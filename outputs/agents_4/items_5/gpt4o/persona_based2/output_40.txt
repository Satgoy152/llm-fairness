Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  76  78  55  95
1  29  31  65  98  48
2  46  42  86  25  13
3   2  91  12  60  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 31 65 98 48]
 [46 42 86 25 13]
 [ 2 91 12 60 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

First, let's summarize the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 54 + 76 + 78 + 55 + 95 = 358
- Agent 1's total valuation: 29 + 31 + 65 + 98 + 48 = 271
- Agent 2's total valuation: 46 + 42 + 86 + 25 + 13 = 212
- Agent 3's total valuation: 2 + 91 + 12 + 60 + 55 = 220

Now, let's attempt a fair allocation based on maximizing the individual valuations for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:** Receives item 4 (value 95, highest for agent 0)
2. **Agent 1:** Receives item 3 (value 98, highest for agent 1)
3. **Agent 2:** Receives item 2 (value 86, highest for agent 2)
4. **Agent 3:** Receives item 1 (value 91, highest for agent 3)

At this point, each agent has received one item. We still have item 0 left to allocate.

5. **Item 0:** Allocate to Agent 0 (value 54, next highest value for agent 0 after item 4)

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 0]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: Item [1]

This allocation aims to respect the highest valuations of each agent for the items while ensuring that all items are distributed. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
