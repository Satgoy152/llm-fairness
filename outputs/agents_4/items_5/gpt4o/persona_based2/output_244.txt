Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  80   2  98  60
1  10  72  36  84  96
2  34   6  76  56  49
3  87  12  28  76   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we'll use the valuations in the table to try and make sure each agent is as satisfied as possible with the allocation they receive. Given that we have four agents and five items, not all agents will receive the same number of items, but we aim to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy.

Let's start by reviewing the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  80   2  98  60
1  10  72  36  84  96
2  34   6  76  56  49
3  87  12  28  76   2
```

We can try to allocate based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 3 highly (98).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value is item 4 (96).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is item 2 (76).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value is item 0 (87).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now we have one item remaining (item 1) to allocate. We need to choose an agent who would value this item relatively more than others or balance the assignments:

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 80.
  - Agent 1 values it at 72.
  - Agent 2 values it at 6.
  - Agent 3 values it at 12.

Agent 0 values item 1 the highest, so we will assign item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, each agent has received at least one item, and all items are allocated. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This JSON structure shows that Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3, Agent 1 receives item 4, Agent 2 receives item 2, and Agent 3 receives item 0. This allocation attempts to reflect the agents' preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
