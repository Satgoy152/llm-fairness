Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  31  46  27  48
1  86  62  25  46  67
2  46   7  63  67   1
3  58  25  97  33  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10 31 46 27 48]
 [86 62 25 46 67]
 [46  7 63 67  1]
 [58 25 97 33 50]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to find an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should feel that their own allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [10, 31, 46, 27, 48]
Agent 1: [86, 62, 25, 46, 67]
Agent 2: [46, 7, 63, 67, 1]
Agent 3: [58, 25, 97, 33, 50]
```

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while trying to minimize envy among them. 

1. **Item 0** (valued highest by Agent 1 with 86): Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1** (valued highest by Agent 0 with 31): Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2** (valued highest by Agent 3 with 97): Assign to Agent 3.
4. **Item 3** (valued highest by Agent 2 with 67): Assign to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4** (valued highest by Agent 0 with 48): Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 4]
- Agent 1 gets item [0]
- Agent 2 gets item [3]
- Agent 3 gets item [2]

This allocation tries to respect each agent's highest valued items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

The JSON format of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```
