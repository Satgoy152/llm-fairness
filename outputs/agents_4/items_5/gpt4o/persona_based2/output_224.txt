Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50   6  52  80  14
1  88  10  75  85  23
2  15  42  18  52  86
3  88  81  14   3  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50  6 52 80 14]
 [88 10 75 85 23]
 [15 42 18 52 86]
 [88 81 14  3 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Let's evaluate the valuations and provide an allocation strategy:

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [50, 6, 52, 80, 14]
- Agent 1: [88, 10, 75, 85, 23]
- Agent 2: [15, 42, 18, 52, 86]
- Agent 3: [88, 81, 14, 3, 64]

### Steps to Determine a Fair Allocation:
1. **Identify Each Agent's Preference:** 
   - For each agent, identify the item with the highest valuation.

2. **Check for Conflicts:**
   - If more than one agent desires the same item as their highest preference, resolve conflicts by possibly selecting their next preferred item or ensuring an equitable distribution of total value.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Allocate the items based on preferences, resolving any conflicts to maintain fairness.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0** prefers item 3 (value: 80).
- **Agent 1** prefers item 0 (value: 88).
- **Agent 2** prefers item 4 (value: 86).
- **Agent 3** prefers item 0, but since agent 1 has a higher preference for item 0 and no other agent prefers item 1 as their highest, agent 3 can take item 1 (value: 81).

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 1

**Remaining Item (To ensure all items are allocated):**
- **Item 2:** Since item 2 isn't allocated yet and has moderate valuations, it can be allocated to Agent 2 who values it at 18, balancing the overall distribution.

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

The allocation ensures that every agent receives their most valued item where possible, and any conflicts are resolved by allocating next-best items, maintaining an approximate balance in total valuation.
