Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  87  22  88  74
1  42  91  44  90  30
2  10  48  53  50  32
3  84  32  61  27  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 91 44 90 30]
 [10 48 53 50 32]
 [84 32 61 27 96]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Given the constraints, this can be approached using the concept of envy-freeness where possible.

Let's analyze the valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0 values: 98, 87, 22, 88, 74
- Agent 1 values: 42, 91, 44, 90, 30
- Agent 2 values: 10, 48, 53, 50, 32
- Agent 3 values: 84, 32, 61, 27, 96

To achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (98) and item 3 (88). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (91) and item 3 (90). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively even spread with item 2 (53) being the highest. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 (96) the most. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we have one more item left, which is item 3:

- Item 3 remaining, valued by:
  - Agent 0: 88
  - Agent 1: 90
  - Agent 2: 50
  - Agent 3: 27

The highest value for item 3 among the remaining agents is with Agent 1 (90). However, since Agent 1 already has item 1, assigning item 3 to Agent 0 will balance the allocations while still giving Agent 0 a good value.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing potential envy.
