Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  34  67  89  40
1  95  96  46  56   6
2  85   9  34  74  61
3  31  73  76  78  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to take into account the valuations each agent has for the items. One common approach to ensure fairness is to use the "largest remainder method" or "method of equal proportions," but given the constraints, I'll use a straightforward approach to balance the allocation based on maximizing perceived value for each agent.

The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocated items is maximized, while no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Start by examining the highest valued items for each agent and allocate them sequentially.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and try to maximize the total value for each agent.

Letâ€™s go through the allocation process:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 3 (value 89).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 1 (value 96).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 0 (value 85).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 3 (value 78), but already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 2 (value 76).

Now, allocate the remaining item:
- Item 4 is left, and based on maximizing value, Agent 3 should get item 4 (value 43).

Thus, the allocation can be as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets items 2 and 4.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
