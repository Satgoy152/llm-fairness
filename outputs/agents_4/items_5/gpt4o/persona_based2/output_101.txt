Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  91  43  66  78
1  88  55  56  75  91
2  17   2  71  89  75
3  98  88   9  69  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[30 91 43 66 78]
 [88 55 56 75 91]
 [17  2 71 89 75]
 [98 88  9 69 58]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, which means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuation. Given the valuations, let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy.

Here is the valuation table for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  91  43  66  78
1  88  55  56  75  91
2  17   2  71  89  75
3  98  88   9  69  58
```

**Strategy:**
1. Assign items to agents based on maximizing each agent's minimum satisfaction.
2. Try to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 91.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 91.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 89.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most at 98.

Now, let's allocate these items accordingly to minimize envy:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, item 2 remains unallocated. Agent 2 values item 2 the most after item 3, with a value of 71, so we will assign item 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets their most valued available item, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the requirement of allocating all 5 items while considering fair division principles.
