Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  22  79  41  14
1  81  60  67  38  87
2   6  21   0  37  55
3   9  62   0  21  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 60 67 38 87]
 [ 6 21  0 37 55]
 [ 9 62  0 21 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation.

First, let's summarize the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [35, 22, 79, 41, 14]
- Agent 1: [81, 60, 67, 38, 87]
- Agent 2: [6, 21, 0, 37, 55]
- Agent 3: [9, 62, 0, 21, 83]

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is the "Envy-Free" method, where we aim to minimize envy by maximizing the minimum value each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most with 79.
2. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most with 87.
3. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most with 37.
4. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most with 62.
5. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it with 81. Given their high valuation, and since Agent 1 only has one item, allocate it to them.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy and meeting the requirement of allocating all items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
