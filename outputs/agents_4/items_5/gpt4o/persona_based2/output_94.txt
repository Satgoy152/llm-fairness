Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  28   3  50   4
1  59  87  23  60  85
2  61  40  97  75  43
3   7  57  30  19  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, weâ€™ll aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent is content with their allocation, given their individual valuations of the items. One approach to tackle such a problem is to use an algorithm that considers the maximum envy-free allocation or the efficient allocation based on valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 0 the highest (57), followed by item 3 (50).
- **Agent 1:** Values item 1 the highest (87), followed by item 4 (85).
- **Agent 2:** Values item 2 the highest (97), followed by item 3 (75).
- **Agent 3:** Values item 1 and item 4 equally (57), followed by item 3 (19).

By examining the valuations, we can try to allocate each agent their highest-valued item, if possible, while minimizing envy. 

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (value 57 by agent 0).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 (value 85 by agent 1).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (value 97 by agent 2).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 1 (value 57 by agent 3).

Now, only item 3 remains unallocated. 

- Agent 2 values item 3 quite high (75), and since they already received their highest-valued item (item 2), it makes sense to give item 3 to an agent for whom it is still valuable, but not as highly valued as their best choice. 

We see that Agent 1 also values item 3 highly (60). Assigning item 3 to Agent 1 will not increase envy significantly because Agent 1 already received another high-value item (item 4).

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 4]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: [1]

This allocation aims to consider each agent's highest-valued item while distributing all items among them. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
