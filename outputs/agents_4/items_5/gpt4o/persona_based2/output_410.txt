Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  54  82  77  76
1  34  25   7  62  97
2   1  87  41  71  55
3  69  28  19  46  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to use a method that attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives. Here is a step-by-step process for determining a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: Look for the highest value each agent has for any item.

2. **Allocate items based on highest preference**: Try to give each agent one of their most valued items if possible.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Distribute the remaining items to agents such that the total number of items remains 5, and no agent receives more than their perceived value from another.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3. We can allocate item 2 to Agent 0 since it's the highest value.
- **Agent 1** values item 4 the most, so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 1 the most, so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 0 highly, so allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

At this point, items 3 remains unallocated. We can assign this item to the agent who would consider it most valuable among those who have not received their top choice (Agent 2 in this case).

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute items in a manner that respects the agents' preferences as closely as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
