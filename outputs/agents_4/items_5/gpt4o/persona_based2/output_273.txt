Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  33  46  70  21
1  39  41  51  21  72
2  59  10  87  33   5
3  33  27  66  95  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we can use the "maximum envy-free" approach, which ensures that each agent receives their most valued item, if possible, or a set of items that maximizes their satisfaction without causing envy.

Here's a strategy to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 3, but since Agent 0 also highly values item 3, we will allocate item 0 to Agent 3, which is Agent 3's second-highest valued item and not highly valued by the others.

Let's allocate based on the above observations:

- **Agent 0** receives item 3.
- **Agent 1** receives item 4.
- **Agent 2** receives item 2.
- **Agent 3** receives item 0.

Now, item 1 remains unallocated. We can allocate it to the agent with the least total value from their received items to ensure fairness:

- **Agent 3** receives item 1, which increases their total valuation without causing envy.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their satisfaction given the constraints and minimizes envy among agents.
