Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3   2  72  20  64
1  85  57  29  77  76
2  59  58  68  10  51
3  79  10   3   5  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free distribution where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent given their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to find a fair allocation:

1. **List the items and their valuations for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: [3, 2, 72, 20, 64]
   - Agent 1: [85, 57, 29, 77, 76]
   - Agent 2: [59, 58, 68, 10, 51]
   - Agent 3: [79, 10, 3, 5, 20]

2. **Rank the items for each agent based on their valuations**:
   - Agent 0 prefers items in the order: [2, 4, 3, 0, 1]
   - Agent 1 prefers items in the order: [0, 4, 3, 1, 2]
   - Agent 2 prefers items in the order: [2, 0, 1, 4, 3]
   - Agent 3 prefers items in the order: [0, 4, 1, 3, 2]

3. **Allocate items considering preferences**:
   - Start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent if possible, avoiding conflicts.
   - Use sequential allocation or draft method to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

4. **Check allocations for envy-freeness**:
   - Ensure no agent prefers the bundle of another agent more than their own allocation.

Using this approach, here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2, since item 2 was taken).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (second highest remaining value for Agent 3).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and aims to be envy-free:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring all items are allocated.
