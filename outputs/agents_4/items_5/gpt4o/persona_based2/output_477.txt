Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  35  66  80  46
1  49  76  67  72  29
2  39  96  21  61   2
3  77  22  72  48  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 76 67 72 29]
 [39 96 21 61  2]
 [77 22 72 48 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to analyze each agent's valuations and distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness. A common method is to use a round-robin algorithm or other fair division techniques like the adjusted winner procedure, but given the constraints, we can attempt a direct allocation.

Let's assess the situation:

**Agent Valuations:**

- **Agent 0:** [12, 35, 66, 80, 46]
- **Agent 1:** [49, 76, 67, 72, 29]
- **Agent 2:** [39, 96, 21, 61, 2]
- **Agent 3:** [77, 22, 72, 48, 10]

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Item 3 (highest value for Agent 0):** Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 80, which is also a high value compared to others for the same item.
2. **Item 1 (highest value for Agent 2):** Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 96.
3. **Item 0 (highest value for Agent 3):** Agent 3 values item 0 the most at 77.
4. **Item 2 (shared interest between Agent 1 and Agent 3):** Both Agent 1 and Agent 3 have high valuations on item 2. However, to balance the allocation, assign it to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4 (least valued, distribute to balance):** Assigned to Agent 2 to balance the total value distribution.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]
- Agent 3: [0]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that are of relatively higher value to them, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
