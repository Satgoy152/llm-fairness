Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  69  94  86  65
1  91  42  48  94  34
2  64  77  46  69  29
3  86  21  68  72  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 77 46 69 29]
 [86 21 68 72 94]]
Output:
To approach the problem of fairly allocating items to agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy or ensures fairness. One common method is to use the concept of maximizing the total utility or implementing a method like the envy-free allocation. Here, I'll try to distribute the items to minimize envy among the agents as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [6, 69, 94, 86, 65]
- Agent 1 values items as: [91, 42, 48, 94, 34]
- Agent 2 values items as: [64, 77, 46, 69, 29]
- Agent 3 values items as: [86, 21, 68, 72, 94]

To achieve a fair distribution, we can try to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly, thus minimizing potential envy. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as they value it the highest (94).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 as they value it the highest (94).
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 as they value it the highest (77).
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 as they value it the highest (94).
5. Finally, allocate item 0 to Agent 1, who values it highly (91), to balance the allocations.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
