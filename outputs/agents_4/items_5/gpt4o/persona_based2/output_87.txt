Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  40  90   3  86
1  88  55  38  58  30
2  28  13  95  89  53
3  89  71  48  26  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 55 38 58 30]
 [28 13 95 89 53]
 [89 71 48 26 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. One approach is to maximize the minimum valuation that each agent receives.

Let's analyze the problem:

Agent valuations:
- Agent 0: [52, 40, 90, 3, 86]
- Agent 1: [88, 55, 38, 58, 30]
- Agent 2: [28, 13, 95, 89, 53]
- Agent 3: [89, 71, 48, 26, 88]

Items to allocate: 5 (0 through 4)

We can start by attempting an allocation that prioritizes each agent getting an item they highly value, while ensuring all items are distributed.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (value 90). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (value 88). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (value 89). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (value 88). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

At this point, each agent has one item, and item 1 remains unallocated.

5. **Agent 3** also values item 1 highly (value 71). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Each agent has at least one item, and all items are distributed. Let's summarize the allocations:

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one high-value item they desire, and all items are allocated.
