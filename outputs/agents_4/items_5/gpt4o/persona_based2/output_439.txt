Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  87  17  32  62
1  28   3  89   3  98
2   3  72  77  94  15
3  90  22  24   4  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [90 22 24  4 43]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents, we can try to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. We will consider different allocations and check which one offers the most balanced outcome, ensuring each agent's allocation is as valuable as possible given their preferences.

Here are the valuations of each item for each agent:

- Agent 0: [9, 87, 17, 32, 62]
- Agent 1: [28, 3, 89, 3, 98]
- Agent 2: [3, 72, 77, 94, 15]
- Agent 3: [90, 22, 24, 4, 43]

A fair allocation might involve each agent getting the item they value the most, but with only 5 items to distribute among 4 agents, one agent will receive more than one item or some agents may receive none.

Let's find an allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while maintaining fairness:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 because it is their highest valued item (value: 98).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 because it is their highest valued item (value: 90).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because it is their highest valued item (value: 94).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because it is their highest valued item (value: 87).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their second highest valued item (value: 89), and Agent 0 and 2 have already received high-value items relative to their preferences.

This allocation gives each agent at least one of their higher-valued items while avoiding too much envy. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
