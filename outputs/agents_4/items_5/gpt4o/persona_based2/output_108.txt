Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  46  66  44  50
1  53  79  52  87  87
2  28  42  73  57  66
3   5  39  24   5   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 46 66 44 50]
 [53 79 52 87 87]
 [28 42 73 57 66]
 [ 5 39 24  5  8]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will look for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. Envy-freeness means that each agent feels they receive a bundle of items at least as good as any other agentâ€™s bundle in their own valuation.

Let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items and then allocate the items in a way that seeks to balance the allocations according to these valuations.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [76, 46, 66, 44, 50] (Total = 282)
- Agent 1: [53, 79, 52, 87, 87] (Total = 358)
- Agent 2: [28, 42, 73, 57, 66] (Total = 266)
- Agent 3: [5, 39, 24, 5, 8]   (Total = 81)

### Allocation Strategy:
Given agent 3's valuations are significantly lower, we might prioritize giving agent 3 fewer items but ones that are relatively more valuable to them, minimizing their envy. We aim to distribute items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their own valuations.

1. **Agent 1**: Since they have the highest total valuation, we should prioritize giving them high-value items to reduce potential envy.
2. **Agent 0**: They should receive items with moderate value to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that have higher value relative to their valuations.
4. **Agent 3**: Given their low valuation, we need to be strategic with item allocation to them.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value = 76)
- **Agent 1**: Items 3 and 4 (values = 87, 87)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (value = 73)
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value = 39)

### Resulting Allocations:
- Agent 0 receives item 0, which is highly valued by them.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4, both of which are highly valued by them and contribute to reducing envy.
- Agent 2 receives item 2, which is their highest-valued item.
- Agent 3 receives item 1, which maximizes their satisfaction given their lower overall valuations.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the distribution fairly and minimize envy among agents based on their individual valuations.
