Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78   3   3  14  94
1  95  47   4  34  15
2  69  72  78  38  69
3  12  73  64  21  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 47  4 34 15]
 [69 72 78 38 69]
 [12 73 64 21 87]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we can utilize an algorithm such as the maximum Nash welfare approach. This method aims to maximize the product of the agents' utilities, often leading to a more balanced allocation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [78, 3, 3, 14, 94]
Agent 1: [95, 47, 4, 34, 15]
Agent 2: [69, 72, 78, 38, 69]
Agent 3: [12, 73, 64, 21, 87]
```

We need to allocate all five items among the four agents. Let's go through the valuations and allocate items to maximize fairness:

1. **Item 4** (valued highest by Agent 0 and 3):
   - Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 3 at 87.
   - Assign to Agent 0 because they value it the highest.

2. **Item 0** (valued highest by Agent 1):
   - Agent 1 values it at 95, followed by Agent 0 at 78.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2** (valued highest by Agent 2):
   - Agent 2 values it at 78, followed by Agent 3 at 64.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

4. **Item 1** (valued highest by Agent 3):
   - Agent 3 values it at 73, followed by Agent 2 at 72.
   - Assign to Agent 3.

5. **Item 3** (valued by all agents):
   - Agent 2 values it at 38, followed by Agent 1 at 34.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

By this distribution, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
