Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  83  80  10  91
1  37  54  65   3  28
2  70  26  61  91  96
3  58  98  67  12  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [58 98 67 12 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent receives a bundle that they value as much as or more than the bundle of any other agent. Given the small number of agents and items, we can manually check different allocations to ensure envy-freeness or approximate envy-freeness.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Given the highest valuation for item 4, allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Since agent 1 has a relatively balanced valuation, allocate item 2 to agent 1, which is their highest valued item.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 to agent 2, which is their second-highest valued item, but the one with the highest value among the remaining items.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1 to agent 3, as it is their highest valued item.

Now we have one item left, item 0. Since agent 0 already has one high-value item, we can allocate item 0 to agent 2 to ensure a relatively balanced distribution of total valuations.

Let's check the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [4] with a total value of 91.
- **Agent 1**: Items [2] with a total value of 65.
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 3] with a total value of 70 + 91 = 161.
- **Agent 3**: Items [1] with a total value of 98.

Now, let’s present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims for a fair distribution of items based on the agents’ valuations.
