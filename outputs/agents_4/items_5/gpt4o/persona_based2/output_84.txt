Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  84  34  30  66
1  79  77  23  96  99
2   2  48  76  70  99
3   8  81   9  74   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 48 76 70 99]
 [ 8 81  9 74  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. First, let's summarize each agent's valuation for the items:

- Agent 0: [97, 84, 34, 30, 66]
- Agent 1: [79, 77, 23, 96, 99]
- Agent 2: [2, 48, 76, 70, 99]
- Agent 3: [8, 81, 9, 74, 4]

The objective is to allocate items so that each agent values their allocation highly, preferably minimizing envy.

Let's proceed with a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest valued item to each agent first, if possible, without overlap.
2. Ensure that each item is assigned to exactly one agent.
3. Try to balance the total value each agent receives.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 84, but Agent 3 values it at 81, which is the highest for Agent 3 and close to Agent 0's valuation. Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 76.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 96.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 99, which is the highest valuation for this item and overall.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 1

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of their higher-valued items, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
