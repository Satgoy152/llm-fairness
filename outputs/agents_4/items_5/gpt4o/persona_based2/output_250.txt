Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  29  83  38  18
1   1  38  90  35  15
2  48   5  58   5  60
3  38  87  17  43   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. Our goal is to distribute all 5 items such that each agent is reasonably satisfied with their allocation.

Here are the valuations of each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [23, 29, 83, 38, 18]
- Agent 1: [1, 38, 90, 35, 15]
- Agent 2: [48, 5, 58, 5, 60]
- Agent 3: [38, 87, 17, 43, 3]

We will try to allocate items such that each agent receives a set of items where they perceive the highest value, while also considering the overall fairness.

One potential fair allocation using these valuations is:

1. **Agent 0** receives items with indices [2, 3]:
   - Item 2: Value is 83 for Agent 0
   - Item 3: Value is 38 for Agent 0
   - Total value for Agent 0 = 121

2. **Agent 1** receives item with index [1]:
   - Item 1: Value is 38 for Agent 1
   - Total value for Agent 1 = 38

3. **Agent 2** receives item with index [4]:
   - Item 4: Value is 60 for Agent 2
   - Total value for Agent 2 = 60

4. **Agent 3** receives item with index [0]:
   - Item 0: Value is 38 for Agent 3
   - Total value for Agent 3 = 38

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their received items given their individual valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
