Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  75  19  94  95
1  22  56  67  38   8
2  39  29  68  72  68
3  40  56   4  23  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Since there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent can receive 2 items, while the others receive 1 item each. Our goal is to distribute the items so that no agent envies another's allocation based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Values are [27, 75, 19, 94, 95]
- **Agent 1**: Values are [22, 56, 67, 38, 8]
- **Agent 2**: Values are [39, 29, 68, 72, 68]
- **Agent 3**: Values are [40, 56, 4, 23, 47]

A simple way to ensure fairness is by allocating the highest-valued item to the agent who values it the most. This approach minimizes envy as each agent is at least receiving their most valued item (or set of items).

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest with a value of 95.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the highest with a value of 67.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the highest with a value of 72.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the highest with a value of 56.

Now we have one item left, which is item 0. We need to allocate it to one of the agents such that the allocation remains as fair as possible.

- Item 0's valuations:
  - Agent 0: 27
  - Agent 1: 22
  - Agent 2: 39
  - Agent 3: 40

Agent 3 values item 0 the highest, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Thus, the final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```
