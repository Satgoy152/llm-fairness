Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  93  90  22  27
1  35  42  52  63  41
2  49  64  26   6   2
3  49  77  51  34   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [49 77 51 34  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received items of fair value relative to their own valuations. The main challenge is to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuation perspective.

Let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
  Items
  0   1   2   3   4
0 22  93  90  22  27
1 35  42  52  63  41
2 49  64  26   6   2
3 49  77  51  34   5
```

We should aim to allocate the items such that:

1. Each agent receives items they value highly relative to other agents.
2. The allocation minimizes potential envy.

Given the above valuations, let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 and item 2 highly (93 and 90), so they should get one of these high-value items.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (63), so they should receive item 3.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (49), which is not valued as highly by others.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest (77) after Agent 0, so they can receive item 1, as Agent 0 receives item 2.

After considering these preferences, the allocations can be:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- The remaining item (item 4) should be allocated to Agent 1, who values it the next highest after item 3.

This allocation strategy attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives at least one item they value the most, or close to it, compared to other available items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value highly compared to other possibilities.
