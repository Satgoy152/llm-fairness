Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  29  38  81  76
1  18   1  72   1   0
2  90  87  21   4  73
3  63   2  13  83  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible. One common approach in fair division is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations of the agents for each item, we can attempt to find an allocation that maximizes fairness. We can consider several allocation strategies and evaluate them based on the total value each agent receives from the items assigned to them.

Let's summarize the valuations for each agent for the items:

- Agent 0: [84, 29, 38, 81, 76]
- Agent 1: [18, 1, 72, 1, 0]
- Agent 2: [90, 87, 21, 4, 73]
- Agent 3: [63, 2, 13, 83, 69]

To achieve an allocation that is as fair as possible, we can consider the following allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it.

Now, let's verify the allocation and ensure that each item is assigned to exactly one agent and that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 receives items [3, 4].
- Agent 1 receives item [2].
- Agent 2 receives items [0, 1].
- Agent 3 receives no items.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and we have attempted to maximize the fairness by considering the highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": []
}
```
