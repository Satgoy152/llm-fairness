Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73   3   5  90  46
1  32  15  49  58  30
2  73  32  13  14  62
3  73  34  13  65  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 15 49 58 30]
 [73 32 13 14 62]
 [73 34 13 65 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to minimize envy, which occurs when an agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. A common method for achieving an envy-free allocation is to use the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" approach, where agents take turns picking the item they value the most among the remaining items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 73     | 3      | 5      | 90     | 46     |
| 1     | 32     | 15     | 49     | 58     | 30     |
| 2     | 73     | 32     | 13     | 14     | 62     |
| 3     | 73     | 34     | 13     | 65     | 97     |

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is Item 3 (value 90)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is Item 2 (value 49)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is Item 0 (value 73)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is Item 4 (value 97)

Now, only Item 1 is left:

5. **Agent 0**: Next highest value among remaining items is Item 1 (value 3), but since it is the last one, it will go to the next in line without any envy, which is **Agent 2**.

Allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: Item 4

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
