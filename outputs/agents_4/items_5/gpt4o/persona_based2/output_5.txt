Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  54  69  54  19
1  88  22   7  47  24
2  86  92  94  29  86
3   4  79  61  99  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. Our goal is to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given that each agent gets an integer number of items. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocations of other agents, based on their own valuation.

Here is the valuation matrix provided:

```
        0   1   2   3   4
    0  53  54  69  54  19
    1  88  22   7  47  24
    2  86  92  94  29  86
    3   4  79  61  99  76
```

Given these valuations, we can proceed with the allocation. One approach is to try to allocate items to the agents that value them the most, while ensuring that no agent is left without items if possible.

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 with a valuation of 94. Allocating item 2 to agent 2 seems optimal.
2. **Agent 3** highly values item 3 with a valuation of 99. Allocating item 3 to agent 3 seems optimal.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 with a valuation of 88. Allocating item 0 to agent 1 seems optimal.
4. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 with a valuation of 54. Allocating item 1 to agent 0 seems reasonable.
5. For item 4, both agent 2 and agent 3 have relatively high valuations (86 and 76, respectively). Since agent 2 already has item 2, we can allocate item 4 to agent 3.

Thus, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly while keeping the allocation balanced.
