Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  59  84  14  85
1   7  88  50  66  34
2  35  71  92  16  71
3  67  50  26   9  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items that another agent has been allocated over their own bundle. Given the valuations table, we need to find an allocation that satisfies this condition and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items distributed.

Here's the valuations table for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 76     | 59     | 84     | 14     | 85     |
| 1     | 7      | 88     | 50     | 66     | 34     |
| 2     | 35     | 71     | 92     | 16     | 71     |
| 3     | 67     | 50     | 26     | 9      | 41     |

To make the allocation, we'll prioritize maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items 2 and 4 highly. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highly. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 highly but it's already assigned. Assign item 0, which is the next highest available item for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 highly but it's already assigned. Assign item 3, which is the next highest available item for Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, reducing envy. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This solution provides each agent with at least one item they value highly, thereby reducing potential envy among them.
