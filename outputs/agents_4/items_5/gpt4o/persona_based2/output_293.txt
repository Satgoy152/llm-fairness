Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  50  94  72  73
1  70  81   2  39  40
2  66  15  51  31  73
3  38  16  86  90  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 50 94 72 73]
 [70 81  2 39 40]
 [66 15 51 31 73]
 [38 16 86 90 85]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility, which is a common approach in ensuring fairness. This approach aims to give each agent at least one of their higher-valued items, while trying to keep the envy among agents as low as possible.

Let's look at the valuation matrix:

```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4
-----------|--------------------
    0      | 92  50  94  72  73
    1      | 70  81   2  39  40
    2      | 66  15  51  31  73
    3      | 38  16  86  90  85
```

Based on the valuations, we aim to allocate items to maximize the minimum satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3.

Let's attempt the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items [0, 2] (most valued items, 92 and 94).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item [1] (most valued item, 81).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item [4] (most valued item, 73).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item [3] (most valued item, 90).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets one of the items they value the most, and the total number of items allocated is 5.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
