Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  22  75  24  98
1  99  10  53  83  82
2  20  99  99  78  37
3  95  72  28  66  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations, we can proceed with an allocation that aims to minimize envy. One potential method is to use a round-robin allocation in which each agent, in turn, selects their most preferred available item. We will proceed with this allocation method.

Here's how the allocation might proceed:

1. **Agent 0** selects item 4 (value 98).
2. **Agent 1** selects item 0 (value 99).
3. **Agent 2** selects item 1 (value 99).
4. **Agent 3** selects item 3 (value 66).
5. **Agent 0**, for the second round, selects item 2 (value 75).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one highly valued item according to their preferences, thus reducing possible envy.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.
