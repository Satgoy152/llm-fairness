Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  25  91  77  47
1   9  18  50  34  62
2  38  80  35  44  88
3  91  26   1  92   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a fair manner, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent feels they are getting a fair share based on their valuations. One commonly used method for such problems is the "Envy-Free" allocation, which seeks to distribute items such that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [32, 25, 91, 77, 47]
- Agent 1 values: [9, 18, 50, 34, 62]
- Agent 2 values: [38, 80, 35, 44, 88]
- Agent 3 values: [91, 26, 1, 92, 6]

The strategy is to assign items based on the highest personal valuation to reduce the potential for envy. However, we must ensure each item is assigned to only one agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 at 92.
2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 at 91.
3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 at 80.
4. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 at 62.
5. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 3**: Although Agent 3 has already received item 3, their next highest valuation is for item 0 at 91.

Assigning the items in this manner aims to ensure that each agent gets at least one of their higher-valued items while minimizing envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```
