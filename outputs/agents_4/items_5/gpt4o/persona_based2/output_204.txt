Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  60  81  60  63
1  55  95   7  71  79
2  24  81  17   6   7
3  80  99  46  75   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 60 81 60 63]
 [55 95  7 71 79]
 [24 81 17  6  7]
 [80 99 46 75  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' preferences and try to distribute the items in a manner that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation of any other agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [75, 60, 81, 60, 63]
- Agent 1 values items as: [55, 95, 7, 71, 79]
- Agent 2 values items as: [24, 81, 17, 6, 7]
- Agent 3 values items as: [80, 99, 46, 75, 8]

To achieve a fair division, we will consider each agent's highest valuation for the items that are still available and allocate based on maximizing individual satisfaction while minimizing envy.

1. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest (99) among all items and agents, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest (81) among the remaining items, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (79) among the remaining items, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 3** now has the highest remaining valuation for item 3 (75), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 0** values the last remaining item 0 (75), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives each agent items that maximize their valuations given the choices available, aiming to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
