Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  72  81  79  37
1  49  41  26   2  22
2   7  26  76  28  68
3  80  20   6  68  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider using the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Given the valuations for each agent, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Agent 3 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 54      | 49      | 7       | 80      |
| 1    | 72      | 41      | 26      | 20      |
| 2    | 81      | 26      | 76      | 6       |
| 3    | 79      | 2       | 28      | 68      |
| 4    | 37      | 22      | 68      | 48      |

Our objective is to allocate all 5 items to the agents in a way that respects their preferences as much as possible.

One possible fair allocation is:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3, as they value it the highest at 80.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest at 72.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest at 76.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest at 79.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest at 68.

This allocation is chosen to maximize the satisfaction (or the valuation) of each agent for the items they receive, thereby minimizing envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent is given items according to their preferences as much as possible, considering the constraints of the problem.
