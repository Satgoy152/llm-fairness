Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  91  99  20  42
1  52  26  97  28  26
2  36  98   8  70  99
3  63  99  38  14  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 98  8 70 99]
 [63 99 38 14 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we need to distribute the 5 items (0 to 4) among the 4 agents (0 to 3).

Let's summarize the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0 values: [16, 91, 99, 20, 42]
- Agent 1 values: [52, 26, 97, 28, 26]
- Agent 2 values: [36, 98, 8, 70, 99]
- Agent 3 values: [63, 99, 38, 14, 72]

To find an allocation:

1. **Item 2** is most valued by Agent 0 (99). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 3 (99). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 2 (99). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 3 (63). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 2 (70). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value:

- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives no items, as their highest valuation is for item 2, which Agent 0 highly values more.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 1.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
