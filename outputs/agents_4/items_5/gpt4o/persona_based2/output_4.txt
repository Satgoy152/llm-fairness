Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  60  58  91  35
1  93  45  27  69  68
2  31  88  75  74  38
3   2  92  67  61  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 45 27 69 68]
 [31 88 75 74 38]
 [ 2 92 67 61 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to assign items such that no agent feels another agent has received a more valuable bundle of items. Given the preference table, let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy:

Valuations:
```
Agent 0: 50, 60, 58, 91, 35
Agent 1: 93, 45, 27, 69, 68
Agent 2: 31, 88, 75, 74, 38
Agent 3:  2, 92, 67, 61, 28
```

A possible allocation approach is as follows:

1. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 91.
2. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 93.
3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 88.
4. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 67.
5. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 4 at 68, which is higher than any other agent's valuation of the remaining items.

This allocation aims to minimize envy by assigning each agent at least one highly valued item, or in the case of agents with multiple items, ensuring they receive a combination of items that is collectively valuable to them.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.
