Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  32   7  91  25
1  63   5  91  49  23
2  30  90  34  90  19
3  11  12  29  65  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free distribution where possible. Given the constraints, we'll allocate the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

The values each agent ascribes to the items are as follows:

- Agent 0: [20, 32, 7, 91, 25]
- Agent 1: [63, 5, 91, 49, 23]
- Agent 2: [30, 90, 34, 90, 19]
- Agent 3: [11, 12, 29, 65, 13]

To find a fair allocation, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives while minimizing envy. A common approach in such problems is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, where an allocation is such that any envy an agent has towards another agent can be eliminated by removing a single item from the other agent's bundle.

Considering the valuations, a potential fair allocation could be:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 3, as it balances the distribution considering their valuations.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 3 with value 91.
- Agent 1 receives item 2 with value 91.
- Agent 2 receives item 1 with value 90.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 4 with total value 24.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value and aims to be as envy-free as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
