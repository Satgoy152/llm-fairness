Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42   2  21  15  72
1  17  33  77  93  55
2  95  46  75  74  92
3  46  21  39  29  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure an envy-free distribution as much as possible. The challenge is to allocate exactly 5 items to 4 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items. We also want to minimize envy, which means each agent should value their allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation.

Let's summarize the steps:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item:** This helps us understand which items are most valued overall and could potentially cause envy if not allocated wisely.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:** Allocate each item to the agent who values it the highest.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If any agent receives more items than others, reallocate items considering both highest valuations and fairness.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

**Initial Highest Valuation:**
- Item 0: Agent 2 (95)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (2)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (77)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (93)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (92)

**Initial Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2, 3]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]
- Agent 3: []

**Reallocate to Ensure Each Gets at Least One Item:**
- Move item 4 from Agent 2 to Agent 3 to ensure every agent has at least one item.

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2, 3]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and attempts to address envy by reallocating less-preferred items when possible.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items based on the highest valuations and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, with an attempt to minimize envy.
