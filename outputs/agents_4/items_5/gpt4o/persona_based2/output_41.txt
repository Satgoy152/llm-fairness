Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  51   0  85   7
1  49  14   0  61  22
2  20  90  26   2  79
3  19  28  34  72  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20 90 26  2 79]
 [19 28 34 72 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider the valuations provided and aim for a distribution that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own.

Here's the valuation table for easy reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  51   0  85   7
1  49  14   0  61  22
2  20  90  26   2  79
3  19  28  34  72  50
```

First, we identify the highest value each agent has for any item, which will help us make initial assignments:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (85).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (49).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (90).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (72).

Given this information, we can make the following allocations:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valuation.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valuation.
3. Since Agent 1 values item 0 the most, assign item 0 to Agent 1.
4. For Agent 3, we initially considered item 3, but since it's already assigned, we look for the next highest value, which is item 4 (50). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

At this stage, we have assigned four items: 0, 1, 3, and 4.

Now, we are left with item 2, which has the following valuations:

- Agent 0 values it at 0.
- Agent 1 values it at 0.
- Agent 2 values it at 26.
- Agent 3 values it at 34.

The highest value for item 2 is from Agent 3 (34), so we assign it to Agent 3.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [2, 4]

This allocation uses all items and gives each agent their highest available preference.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
