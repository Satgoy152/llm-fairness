Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57   2  27  71  14
1  96  97  86   1  97
2  61  43  99  58  21
3  12  61  88  28   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, a common goal is to maximize the total satisfaction or value derived from the allocation while ensuring that each agent receives an allocation that is envy-free or as fair as possible.

We can use a simple heuristic approach to achieve this by assigning items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 99.
4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 71.
5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 97.

With this approach, we have the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, and 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: No items

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, and each agent has been considered for potential allocation based on their valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": []
}
```
