Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  71  51  37  18
1   2  76  49  82  18
2  20  74  11  92  93
3  57  88  52  33  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 76 49 82 18]
 [20 74 11 92 93]
 [57 88 52 33 77]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy, given the valuations. One approach to achieve this is to attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's explore the given valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  71  51  37  18
1   2  76  49  82  18
2  20  74  11  92  93
3  57  88  52  33  77
```

We'll try to allocate items such that each agent gets the most valued items available to them, while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible.

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (72).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (82).
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (93).
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most (88).

Let's start by allocating these items to each agent based on their highest valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now we have 4 items allocated, and item 2 is left unallocated.

To decide who should get item 2, we look at the remaining preferences:

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 51.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 49.
- Agent 3 values item 2 at 52.

Agent 3 values item 2 the most among those who have not yet received a second item, so we assign item 2 to Agent 3.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [1, 2]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
