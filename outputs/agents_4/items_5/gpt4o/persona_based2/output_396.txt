Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  79   8  74  79
1   9   9  97   4  92
2  12  95  43   0  35
3  25  73  13  59  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 79  8 74 79]
 [ 9  9 97  4 92]
 [12 95 43  0 35]
 [25 73 13 59 94]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to allocate items such that no agent feels envious of another, if possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. This problem can generally be complex, but we will attempt to make a reasonable allocation based on the given valuations.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [53, 79,  8, 74, 79]
Agent 1: [ 9,  9, 97,  4, 92]
Agent 2: [12, 95, 43,  0, 35]
Agent 3: [25, 73, 13, 59, 94]
```

The goal is to allocate all 5 items. We'll aim for maximizing the total utility while taking into account each agent's preferences:

1. **Item 2:** Highest value is for Agent 1 (97).
2. **Item 4:** Highest value is for Agent 1 (92).
3. **Item 1:** Highest value is for Agent 2 (95).
4. **Item 0:** Highest value is for Agent 0 (53).
5. **Item 3:** Highest value is for Agent 0 (74).

Based on the above observations, a possible allocation is as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Gets items 0 and 3.
- **Agent 1:** Gets item 2 and 4.
- **Agent 2:** Gets item 1.
- **Agent 3:** Gets no items.

Let's summarize this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation aims to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring all items are distributed.
