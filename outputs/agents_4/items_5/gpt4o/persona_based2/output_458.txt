Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  21  23  76  80
1  97  83  37  36  94
2  79  20  69  88  46
3  52  98  76  16  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. This is a challenging problem, especially with integer allocations, but we can attempt to reach a satisfactory solution through various methods like maximizing each agent’s minimum value or attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.

The agents' valuations for each item are:

- Agent 0: [90, 21, 23, 76, 80]
- Agent 1: [97, 83, 37, 36, 94]
- Agent 2: [79, 20, 69, 88, 46]
- Agent 3: [52, 98, 76, 16, 11]

We need to allocate the 5 items (0 through 4) among the 4 agents (0 through 3).

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Maximize each agent’s total value:**
   - Agent 0 values items as [90, 21, 23, 76, 80].
   - Agent 1 values items as [97, 83, 37, 36, 94].
   - Agent 2 values items as [79, 20, 69, 88, 46].
   - Agent 3 values items as [52, 98, 76, 16, 11].

2. **Initial Consideration:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3, as they value it the highest at 98.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest at 97.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest at 88.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it highly at 94 and it's a relatively high value for others too.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it at 23, which is the highest among remaining unallocated items for them.

3. **Analyze and Adjust:**
   - The allocation considers high valuations and attempts to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation.
   - Check if any agent has a strong preference for another's allocation. If necessary, adjust allocations, but ensure that totals remain balanced.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims for each agent to receive items maximizing their values while ensuring every item is allocated. Agent 0 receives item 2, Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4, Agent 2 receives item 3, and Agent 3 receives item 1.
