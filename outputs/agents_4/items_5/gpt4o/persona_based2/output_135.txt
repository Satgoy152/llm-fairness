Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93   4  76  81  72
1  33  14  23  13  72
2  94  66  43  42  12
3  83  11  73  47  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93  4 76 81 72]
 [33 14 23 13 72]
 [94 66 43 42 12]
 [83 11 73 47 85]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for a distribution that minimizes envy and tries to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - We have 4 agents and 5 items.
   - The goal is to allocate all items such that each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

2. **Valuations Matrix**:
   - Agent 0: [93, 4, 76, 81, 72]
   - Agent 1: [33, 14, 23, 13, 72]
   - Agent 2: [94, 66, 43, 42, 12]
   - Agent 3: [83, 11, 73, 47, 85]

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent gets more than necessary while trying to minimize envy.

4. **Item-by-Item Allocation**:
   - **Item 0**:
     - Highest value: Agent 2 (value = 94)
     - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
   - **Item 1**:
     - Highest value: Agent 2 (value = 66)
     - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
   - **Item 2**:
     - Highest value: Agent 0 (value = 76)
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 3**:
     - Highest value: Agent 0 (value = 81)
     - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 4**:
     - Highest value: Agent 3 (value = 85)
     - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Final Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
   - Agent 1: []
   - Agent 2: Items [0, 1]
   - Agent 3: Items [4]

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it most, minimizing potential envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
