Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  92  43  89  20
1  11   1  68  56  82
2  71  89  27   4  47
3  72  90  53  41  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [72 90 53 41 96]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should feel that the set of items they received is at least as valuable as the set received by any other agent, based on their own valuations.

Let's look at a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (92). The next highest is item 3 (89). Allocating items 1 and 3 to Agent 0 gives a total value of 181.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (82). Allocating item 4 to Agent 1 gives a total value of 82.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (89), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 0 (71). Allocating item 0 to Agent 2 gives a total value of 71.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (96), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 1 (90), but it's also allocated. The next highest is item 0 (72), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 2 (53). Allocating item 2 to Agent 3 gives a total value of 53.

Now we have allocated 4 items. The remaining item is item 3, which is not yet allocated. We need to allocate item 3 to an agent who hasn't received many items and still values it reasonably. Agent 3 has not received as many high-value items and values item 3 at 41, which is reasonably high for them.

Hence, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 3]
- Agent 1 receives item [4]
- Agent 2 receives item [0]
- Agent 3 receives items [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```
