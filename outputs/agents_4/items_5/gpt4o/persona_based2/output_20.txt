Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  14  54  93  13
1  62  58  58  54  73
2  88  67  16  19  59
3  96  76  50  40  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 58 58 54 73]
 [88 67 16 19 59]
 [96 76 50 40 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we seek a distribution where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation, given the constraints.

The first step is to calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and determine the optimal allocation based on maximizing individual satisfaction while ensuring fairness:

### Total Valuation for Each Agent:
- Agent 0: 64 + 14 + 54 + 93 + 13 = 238
- Agent 1: 62 + 58 + 58 + 54 + 73 = 305
- Agent 2: 88 + 67 + 16 + 19 + 59 = 249
- Agent 3: 96 + 76 + 50 + 40 + 89 = 351

### Allocation Strategy:
We aim to allocate items such that each agent perceives their share as fair given their own valuations. This often involves finding allocations that maximize each agent's smallest perceived value, aiming for proportionality and minimizing envy.

Given the valuation matrix, consider the following allocation:
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value: 93)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value: 58)
- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 2 (values: 88, 67)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value: 89)

### Verification of Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 3 with a value of 93, which is the highest single valuation among all agents.
- Agent 1 receives item 2 with a value of 58, balancing their allocation relative to their other options.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1, with values of 88 and 67, which maximizes their satisfaction.
- Agent 3 receives item 4 with a value of 89.

### Final Allocations:
This distribution attempts to balance valuations while ensuring each agent gets a reasonably valued item according to their preferences. The chosen configuration maximizes satisfaction with the given constraints.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items matches the available set of five items, ensuring completeness.
