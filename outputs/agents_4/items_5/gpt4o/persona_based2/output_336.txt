Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  26  53   5  92
1  11  90  58  19   8
2  45  98  21  83  44
3  78  48   4  36  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 90 58 19  8]
 [45 98 21 83 44]
 [78 48  4 36 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. Let's evaluate the situation using the given valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that no agent envies another:

The table of valuations is:

```
    Items
     0   1   2   3   4
0    2  26  53   5  92
1   11  90  58  19   8
2   45  98  21  83  44
3   78  48   4  36  15
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest at 92.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest at 90.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest at 98, but since Agent 1 has already been assigned item 1, we look at the next highest value for Agent 2, which is item 3 at 83.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest at 78.

After assigning these items, we have allocated items 0, 1, 3, and 4. This leaves item 2 to be allocated.

5. **Agent 2** can be assigned item 2 as it is the highest remaining value for them at 21.

### Final Allocation

This allocation strategy aims to satisfy each agent by giving them at least one of their highly valued items, thus reducing potential envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive items, and the total number of items allocated is 5.
