Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  11   9  88  54
1  34  36   4  83  74
2  86  34  43  73  59
3  53  69   8  22  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items any other agent received over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. 

2. **Check for Envy and Adjust**: After the initial allocation, check if any agent envies another. If so, try to adjust the allocations to minimize envy.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Given there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent might end up with more items. However, we need to ensure all items are distributed.

Let's apply this approach:

### Initial Allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 86 by Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 69 by Agent 3.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 43 by Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 88 by Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 74 by Agent 1.

### Adjustments:

1. Agent 2 gets both Items 0 and 2 (valued at 86 and 43).
2. Agent 3 gets Item 1 (valued at 69).
3. Agent 0 gets Item 3 (valued at 88).
4. Agent 1 gets Item 4 (valued at 74).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and receives items they highly value.

### Resulting Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on the highest possible valuations they have for the items, given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items.
