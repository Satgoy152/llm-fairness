Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  27  18  36  49
1  79  68  98  20  58
2  21  67  49  24  11
3  25  12  27  58  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 67 49 24 11]
 [25 12 27 58 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring an integer number of items per agent, we will aim for a distribution that attempts to minimize the maximum envy, which is a typical approach in fair division problems. This involves considering the agents' valuations for each item and trying to allocate them in a way that attempts to balance perceived fairness.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [50, 27, 18, 36, 49]
Agent 1: [79, 68, 98, 20, 58]
Agent 2: [21, 67, 49, 24, 11]
Agent 3: [25, 12, 27, 58, 59]
```

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. We have item 3 left. **Agent 3** has a relatively high valuation for item 3 compared to others, so we also allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

This allocation minimizes envy by giving each agent at least one of their higher-valued items, ensuring that no agent is left feeling significantly undervalued.

Here's the final allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
