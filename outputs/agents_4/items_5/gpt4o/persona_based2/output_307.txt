Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65   8  23  71  65
1  71  57   6  18  97
2  14  73  40  82  84
3  39  18  82  55  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 57  6 18 97]
 [14 73 40 82 84]
 [39 18 82 55 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free outcome, ensuring that each agent values their allocated bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given the valuations:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 65 | 8  | 23 | 71 | 65 |
| 1            | 71 | 57 | 6  | 18 | 97 |
| 2            | 14 | 73 | 40 | 82 | 84 |
| 3            | 39 | 18 | 82 | 55 | 78 |

A common approach is to use an algorithm like the adjusted winner procedure or a similar heuristic to ensure fairness. Here is one potential allocation that tries to balance the total valuation for each agent:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 highly (71), so we assign it to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (97), so we assign it to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly (73), so we assign it to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly (82), so we assign it to agent 3.
5. The remaining item 0 is valued the highest by agent 1 (71), but since agent 1 already has item 4, we look at other agents. Agent 0 values it highly (65), so we assign item 0 to agent 0.

The allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2

This allocation is made by trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their respective bundles and balancing the overall fairness.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
