Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78   9  58  18  67
1  51  57  31  39  61
2  36  83  10  91  44
3  45  41  61  93  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 83 10 91 44]
 [45 41 61 93 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value to each agent. One potential approach is to assign items to agents in such a way that minimizes envy, ensuring that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Here's a possible allocation that achieves this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values for items: [78, 9, 58, 18, 67]
   - Highest value: Item 0 (78)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values for items: [51, 57, 31, 39, 61]
   - Highest value: Item 4 (61)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values for items: [36, 83, 10, 91, 44]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (91)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values for items: [45, 41, 61, 93, 39]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (93)

Since Agent 2 and Agent 3 both prefer Item 3 but Agent 2 has the second-highest value for this item, we can consider giving it to Agent 2. To balance the allocation, we will consider the next highest values for the remaining items:

- Agent 3 can be given Item 2 because they also value it highly (61).
- Agent 0 will take the next highest available item, which is Item 1 (9).
- For balance, Agent 1 can take Item 4 (61).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and items are distributed based on the highest valuations among the agents.

Here is the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the valuations and maintain fairness among the agents.
