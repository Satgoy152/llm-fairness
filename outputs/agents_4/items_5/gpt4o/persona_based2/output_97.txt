Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64   3  32  91  64
1  26  33  65  18  46
2  62  56  27  44  27
3  41  72  75  25  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 56 27 44 27]
 [41 72 75 25 11]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent values their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given the valuations, we need to consider both the value each agent assigns to each item and the total number of items, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Considerations**:
   - Total items to be allocated: 5.
   - Total agents: 4.
   - Each agent should ideally receive at least one item, but given there are only 5 items, one agent will receive two items.

2. **Valuations Matrix**:
   - Agent 0: [64, 3, 32, 91, 64]
   - Agent 1: [26, 33, 65, 18, 46]
   - Agent 2: [62, 56, 27, 44, 27]
   - Agent 3: [41, 72, 75, 25, 11]

3. **Greedy Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation to ensure fairness and maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation.

4. **Allocation Process**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (value of 91), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (value of 65), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (value of 62), so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (value of 75), but item 2 is already allocated to Agent 1. The next highest valued item for Agent 3 is item 1 (value of 72), so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Now, allocate the remaining item 4. Agent 0 values it as 64, Agent 1 as 46, Agent 2 as 27, and Agent 3 as 11. Thus, allocate item 4 to Agent 0 as they have the highest valuation for item 4.

### Final Allocation:

Based on the above steps, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item. Agent 0 receives two items due to their highest valuation for the remaining item, maintaining the overall fairness of the distribution.
