Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4   0  24  70  28
1  74  98  86  15  76
2  58  58  80  43  59
3   9  44  38  57  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we will aim to allocate the items to the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's first summarize the valuations of the agents for the items:

- Agent 0: [4, 0, 24, 70, 28]
- Agent 1: [74, 98, 86, 15, 76]
- Agent 2: [58, 58, 80, 43, 59]
- Agent 3: [9, 44, 38, 57, 47]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a simple round-robin method based on the highest valuation each agent has for an unallocated item. This approach doesn't guarantee perfect envy-freeness but helps in minimizing envy.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**
1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 chooses item 3 (value 70, highest for Agent 0).
   - Agent 1 chooses item 1 (value 98, highest for Agent 1).
   - Agent 2 chooses item 2 (value 80, highest for Agent 2).
   - Agent 3 chooses item 4 (value 47, highest for Agent 3).

2. **Round 2:**
   - The remaining item is item 0, choose the agent with the next highest valuation for it.
   - Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 0 (value 74).

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Item [3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 0]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: Item [4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Some envy may still exist, but the allocation prioritizes the highest valuations each agent has for the available items.

**JSON Format Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
