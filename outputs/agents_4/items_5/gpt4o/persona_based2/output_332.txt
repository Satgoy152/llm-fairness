Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  27  22  66  33
1  22  14  68  45  32
2   6  35  75  23   0
3  73  82  69   8  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuations, we can use a strategy to maximize the total satisfaction across agents while attempting to ensure no agent envies another. Let's go through the steps:

1. **List the valuations**:
    - Agent 0: [58, 27, 22, 66, 33]
    - Agent 1: [22, 14, 68, 45, 32]
    - Agent 2: [6, 35, 75, 23, 0]
    - Agent 3: [73, 82, 69, 8, 30]

2. **Identify highest valuations for each item**:
    - Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 73.
    - Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 82.
    - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 75.
    - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 66.
    - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 32.

3. **Allocate items to agents based on highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share**:
    - Agent 0: Item 3 (66)
    - Agent 1: Item 4 (32)
    - Agent 2: Item 2 (75)
    - Agent 3: Items 0 and 1 (73, 82)

This allocation ensures each item is given to an agent who values it highly. Each agent receives at least one item, ensuring a fair distribution based on their highest preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation tries to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one item they value highly, and it distributes all items in a way that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible.
