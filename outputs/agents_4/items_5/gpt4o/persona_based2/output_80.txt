Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  88  53  86  69
1  63  24  72  22  25
2  12  37  69  38  75
3  91  10  34   1  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free division as best as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own allocation. Given the valuations, one approach is to maximize the summed valuations for each agent's allocation.

Let's first look at the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 70     | 88     | 53     | 86     | 69     |
| 1     | 63     | 24     | 72     | 22     | 25     |
| 2     | 12     | 37     | 69     | 38     | 75     |
| 3     | 91     | 10     | 34     |  1     | 66     |

To ensure a fair distribution, let's try to assign items to agents who value them the most, while also ensuring that no agent is left without consideration.

1. **Assign Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 91.
2. **Assign Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 88.
3. **Assign Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 72.
4. **Assign Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 86.
5. **Assign Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 75.

Now, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, or if distributing all 5 items to agents with the highest valuations is not possible, we adjust accordingly:

- Agent 0: Item 1 and Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 0

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and respects the highest valuations for the items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
