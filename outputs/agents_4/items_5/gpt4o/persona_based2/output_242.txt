Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  51  26  77  18
1  28   6  22  29  49
2  59  22   0  22  77
3   4  81  99  49  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28  6 22 29 49]
 [59 22  0 22 77]
 [ 4 81 99 49 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible given their valuations. We'll use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives and look for an allocation that balances the agents' valuations.

Given the valuations table:

```
        0   1   2   3   4
    0  35  51  26  77  18
    1  28   6  22  29  49
    2  59  22   0  22  77
    3   4  81  99  49  80
```

We will consider different allocations and choose one that is approximately envy-free. Let's proceed with the analysis:

1. Agent 3 highly values item 2, with a valuation of 99. Assigning item 2 to agent 3 reduces potential envy significantly due to its high valuation.
2. Agent 0 values item 3 at 77, which is the highest value for this item among all agents. Assigning item 3 to agent 0 maximizes their utility.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 at 77, which is the highest for this item. Assigning item 4 to agent 2 maximizes their utility.
4. Agent 1 values item 0 at 28, and this item is not extremely valued by others. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
5. Finally, item 1 is left, and it is highly valued by agent 3 (81). Assign item 1 to agent 3, as it complements their high valuation of item 2.

The allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning high-value items to the agents who value them the most. Here's the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
