Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  29  98  97  36
1  55  57   3  44   8
2  90  67  82  19  66
3  86  53  85  72  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[17 29 98 97 36]
 [55 57  3 44  8]
 [90 67 82 19 66]
 [86 53 85 72 82]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we'll apply the idea of maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 98.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - After removing item 2 from consideration, Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 57.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - After removing items 2 and 1, Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 90.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - After removing items 2, 1, and 0, Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 82.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, and 4. The remaining item is 3.

5. **Assign the remaining item (3)**:
   - Agent 0 would benefit from item 3 as they value it at 97.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the most preferred remaining item according to their valuation.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
