Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  90  81  64  50
1  65  62  43  74  61
2  98  44   8  48  17
3  34  22  86  25  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy. One method to achieve this is by applying the concept of Envy-Free Allocation with Maximin Share (MMS) as a guideline. While ensuring an exact envy-free allocation is often challenging, especially with integer constraints, we aim to minimize possible envy as much as possible.

The first step is to evaluate the preferences of each agent for the items, which is already provided in the table. We need to allocate the items such that each agent gets a bundle that's as valuable as possible according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [91, 90, 81, 64, 50]
Agent 1: [65, 62, 43, 74, 61]
Agent 2: [98, 44, 8, 48, 17]
Agent 3: [34, 22, 86, 25, 87]
```

One strategy is to allocate items by considering the highest value each agent places on the remaining unallocated items:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (98), so assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly (90), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly (87), so assign item 4 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** also values item 2 highly (81), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (74), so assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure every item is allocated and the allocation looks fair based on the valuations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [0]
- Agent 3: Item [4]

This allocation respects each agent's strong preferences and distributes the items based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, a total of 5 items are allocated, and takes into account the agents' valuations to minimize envy.
