Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  90  83  14  61
1  24  26  26  31  74
2  49  22  62  34  89
3  65  52  60  80  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and aim for an envy-free distribution as much as possible. In this context, we want to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences, even if the distribution is not perfectly envy-free due to integer constraints.

Let's try allocating the items based on maximizing the sum of each agent's valuations of the items they receive:

- **Agent 0**: Values items 0, 1, and 2 highly.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the most.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 highly as well, but their next highest is item 2.
- **Agent 3**: Has a generally even spread but values item 3 the most.

A potential allocation strategy could look like this:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 and item 0 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for these items.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as it is their next highest valued item after item 4.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 to Agent 3, as it is their most valued item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are relatively valuable to them, even though the solution may not be perfectly envy-free due to the constraints of integer allocation.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation uses all 5 items and gives each agent items that align as closely as possible with their preferences.
