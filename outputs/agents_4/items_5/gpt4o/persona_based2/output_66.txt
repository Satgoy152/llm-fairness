Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  85   4  88  41
1  68  67  35  83  64
2   2  25  32  40  19
3  11  86  42  67  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [68 67 35 83 64]
 [ 2 25 32 40 19]
 [11 86 42 67 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to minimize envy, we should aim for an allocation where each agent receives items they highly value. The table of valuations is given as follows:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  85   4  88  41
1  68  67  35  83  64
2   2  25  32  40  19
3  11  86  42  67  95
```

Our goal is to allocate each of the 5 items to one of the 4 agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close as possible to envy-free. 

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value by Agent 1 (68).
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value by Agent 3 (86).
   - Allocate to Agent 3.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest value by Agent 3 (42), but Agent 0 values it lowest.
   - Allocate to Agent 3.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest value by Agent 0 (88).
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value by Agent 3 (95).
   - Allocate to Agent 3.

This allocation aims to maximize the individual satisfaction of each agent based on their valuation of the items. Agents 0, 1, and 3 receive the items they value the most, while Agent 2, who has lower valuations across the items, unfortunately, does not receive any items. This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring the higher valued items go to the agents valuing them the most.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation uses all 5 items, assigning them to agents based on their highest valuations.
