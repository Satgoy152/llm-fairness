Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  78  10   8  97
1   0   7  23  50  10
2  28  19  26  20  11
3  54   5  59  79   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given that we have four agents and five items, we also need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 4 (97) and item 1 (78). Assigning these items to Agent 0 maximizes their value.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 3 (50) the most. Assigning this item to Agent 1 is beneficial for them.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 (28) the highest. Assigning this item to Agent 2 maximizes their value.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 (59) and item 0 (54) the most, but item 0 is already assigned. Assigning item 2 to Agent 3 maximizes their value.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 4 and 1 (values 97 and 78, respectively)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 50)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (value 28)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (value 59)

This allocation ensures all five items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item. Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation seeks to fairly distribute items based on each agent's preferences, maximizing the total value within each agent's allocation.
