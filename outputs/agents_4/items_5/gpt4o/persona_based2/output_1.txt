Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  88   1  51  61
1  18  36  37  56   9
2  94  84  97   7   8
3  33  30  48  85  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[24 88  1 51 61]
 [18 36 37 56  9]
 [94 84 97  7  8]
 [33 30 48 85 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents, we must consider envy-freeness and efficiency in terms of the agents' valuations. One common approach is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) allocation, which often yields fair and envy-free results.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [24, 88, 1, 51, 61]
- Agent 1: [18, 36, 37, 56, 9]
- Agent 2: [94, 84, 97, 7, 8]
- Agent 3: [33, 30, 48, 85, 64]

We will try to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent, meaning each agent prefers their own allocation over others.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (97),** so we assign item 2 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (88),** so we assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 (85),** so we assign item 3 to agent 3.
4. **Agent 0 has the second highest valuation for item 4 (61),** and item 4 is not yet allocated. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
5. **Item 0 remains,** and agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (94). Assign item 0 to agent 2.

### Resulting Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 3: Item [3]

This allocation ensures all 5 items are allocated and attempts to maximize fairness based on the given valuations.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
