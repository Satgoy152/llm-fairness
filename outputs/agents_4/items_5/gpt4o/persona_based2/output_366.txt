Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43   5  54  76  30
1  77  93  50  87  34
2  57  47   4  54  44
3  56  44  75  36  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 93 50 87 34]
 [57 47  4 54 44]
 [56 44 75 36 45]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuation of the items. We will use the valuations from the table to guide the allocation process, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the total value of items.

Let's represent the valuation matrix for clarity:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 43 | 5  | 54 | 76 | 30 |
| 1            | 77 | 93 | 50 | 87 | 34 |
| 2            | 57 | 47 | 4  | 54 | 44 |
| 3            | 56 | 44 | 75 | 36 | 45 |

We will attempt to distribute the items among agents such that the distribution is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints.

### Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (76).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the highest (93).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the highest (57).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the highest (75).

Now, we allocate based on these preferences while ensuring each agent receives a fair share:
- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 0
- **Agent 3**: Item 2

This leaves item 4 unallocated. Let's allocate it based on the next highest valuation:
- **Agent 2** has the second highest valuation for item 4 (44).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item. Now, let's present the final allocation in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
