Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  48  84  58  56
1  60  50   0  61  50
2  60  99  21  34  12
3  97  84  14   7  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 48 84 58 56]
 [60 50  0 61 50]
 [60 99 21 34 12]
 [97 84 14  7 20]]
Output:
To solve this fair division problem with a focus on envy-freeness, we need to assign the five items (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) to the four agents (0, 1, 2, 3) in such a way that every agent either receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle or receives no items at all.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [36, 48, 84, 58, 56]
Agent 1: [60, 50, 0, 61, 50]
Agent 2: [60, 99, 21, 34, 12]
Agent 3: [97, 84, 14, 7, 20]
```

Let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy among the agents and ensure each agent values their allocation highly. Here is a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 2. This item is highly valued by agent 0 (value 84) and not as highly by others.
2. Agent 1 receives item 3. Agent 1 values this item at 61, which is the highest among its options.
3. Agent 2 receives item 1. Agent 2 values this item at 99, which maximizes their satisfaction with a single item.
4. Agent 3 receives item 0. Agent 3 values this item at 97, making it a very favorable choice for them.
5. Agent 3 also receives item 4. Agent 3 values this item at 20, which complements their allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item they highly value, minimizing envy based on the available valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This solution assigns all 5 items and ensures that each agent is receiving an allocation that is considered fair based on their highest values for a single item.
