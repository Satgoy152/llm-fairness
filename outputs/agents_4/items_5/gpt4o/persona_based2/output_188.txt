Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  35  32  36  66
1  79  49  19  51  67
2  56  65  66   2  84
3  12  85  73  78  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [79 49 19 51 67]
 [56 65 66  2 84]
 [12 85 73 78 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to minimize envy among the agents by considering their valuations. A fair allocation method that can be used in this context is the "Envy-Free Allocation" where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle, given the valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [24, 35, 32, 36, 66]
- Agent 1: [79, 49, 19, 51, 67]
- Agent 2: [56, 65, 66, 2, 84]
- Agent 3: [12, 85, 73, 78, 27]

Now, we will allocate the items to the agents in a manner that attempts to satisfy envy-freeness:

1. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (79) among all agents. We can allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 3** highly values item 1 (85), which is the highest valuation for item 1 across all agents, so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (84), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest (36), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 2** also values item 2 highly (66), which is greater than the valuations of other agents for item 2, so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 1.

This allocation should minimize envy given the valuations provided. Let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving at least one item, and aims to minimize envy given the constraints.
