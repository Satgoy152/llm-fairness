Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  13  38  34  71
1  37  50   7  81  95
2   5  16  57  47  79
3  30   4  21  36  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30  4 21 36 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to allocate all 5 items in a way that respects the preferences of the agents as much as possible.

First, let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [18, 13, 38, 34, 71]
Agent 1: [37, 50, 7, 81, 95]
Agent 2: [5, 16, 57, 47, 79]
Agent 3: [30, 4, 21, 36, 90]
```

One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to use a method like the "round robin" or "sequential allocation," which can help in distributing items based on the highest preference and ensuring fairness. However, given the constraints, we need to manually inspect allocations for fairness.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 1** highly values items 3 and 4. Allocating item 4 to Agent 1 gives them the highest value.
2. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 highly, but since it's already allocated, we give Agent 2 item 3, which is their next highest valued item.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly, but since it's already allocated, we give Agent 3 item 0, which is their next highest valued item.
5. **Agent 0** values item 1 next after item 2, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: [2, 1]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [0]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
