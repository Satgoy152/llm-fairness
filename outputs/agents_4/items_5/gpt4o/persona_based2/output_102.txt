Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  89  94  27   8
1  42  43  19  60  58
2  20  15  12  31  75
3  34  27   9  98  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 43 19 60 58]
 [20 15 12 31 75]
 [34 27  9 98 99]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations of each agent for each item and distribute the items so that no agent feels worse off compared to another. Given the valuations, we can attempt different allocations to achieve this. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (94).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (60).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (75).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most (99).

A potential strategy for achieving a fair allocation is to allocate the items based on the highest personal valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Receives item 2 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 1 (second highest value, given item 3 is contested).
3. **Agent 2**: Receives item 4 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 3 (highest value for Agent 3, after item 4).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item:

- Since Agent 0 has only one item and Agent 1 has lower total value compared to others, give item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations and ensure no agent feels significantly envious. 

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly, with each agent receiving at least one item where possible, while considering their highest-valued items.
