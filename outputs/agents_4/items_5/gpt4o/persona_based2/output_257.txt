Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  59   6  32  60
1  38  30   2   2  20
2  78  47  36  68  97
3  69  36  79  10  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 59  6 32 60]
 [38 30  2  2 20]
 [78 47 36 68 97]
 [69 36 79 10 11]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we aim to allocate the items such that no agent prefers the items assigned to another agent over their own allocation. Let's evaluate the valuations and proceed with the allocation accordingly.

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [27, 59, 6, 32, 60]
- Agent 1: [38, 30, 2, 2, 20]
- Agent 2: [78, 47, 36, 68, 97]
- Agent 3: [69, 36, 79, 10, 11]

### Strategy:
1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: Allocate items that are highly valued uniquely by an agent to that agent.
2. **Balance Remaining Items**: Distribute remaining items considering which agents value them more, while trying to maintain balance in the number of items each agent receives.

### Steps:
- **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (97). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (79). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 1** values item 0 relatively highly compared to other items (38). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** values item 1 highly (59). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 3** has a relatively high value to Agent 2 (68), and Agent 0 (32). Since Agent 2 already has a high-value item and Agent 0 only has one, we assign item 3 to Agent 0.

### Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 3]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and items are assigned based on their relative valuations, aiming for minimal envy.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
