Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  55  80  80  42
1  33  65  23  23  18
2  72  57   5  61  39
3  11  34  72  89  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [11 34 72 89 19]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the four agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or using a method like the envy-free allocation with integer constraints.

The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items in such a way that they perceive their allocation as fair, given the valuation of items by other agents. Here, we will attempt to create a scenario where each agent does not envy the allocation of others, considering their valuations.

Let's first look at the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  55  80  80  42
1  33  65  23  23  18
2  72  57   5  61  39
3  11  34  72  89  19
```

To achieve an envy-free allocation with integer constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most if possible.
2. Ensure that every agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to avoid envy, such that any potential envy is minimized.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (72).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (65).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (80).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (89).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the second most (42), but agent 1 has only one item, so we will give it to agent 1.

Now, let's check and adjust to ensure fairness and minimize envy:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation ensures that each agent values their items highly, and the distribution of items is balanced.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

Each agent receives items without any substantial envy, given the constraints of integer allocations.
