Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  71  96  15  72
1  17  67  60  58  62
2  18  68  86  66  98
3  92  31  15   0  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their allocated items as highly as possible, given the constraints. One of the well-known methods to achieve this is the adjusted winner procedure or the use of algorithms like the envy-free up to one good (EF1) principle. However, since we are dealing with integer allocations and a small number of agents and items, we can manually try to achieve a balanced distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items in a way that attempts to balance the perceived fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are [88, 71, 96, 15, 72]
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are [17, 67, 60, 58, 62]
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are [18, 68, 86, 66, 98]
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are [92, 31, 15, 0, 81]

A potential fair allocation can be considered by ensuring that each agent receives at least one of their higher valued items or the best possible given the constraints:

- **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (92) and item 4 (81), so let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (98), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest (96), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (58), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 as it is their second highest valued item and it balances the allocation.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item they value relatively well, minimizing potential envy. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
