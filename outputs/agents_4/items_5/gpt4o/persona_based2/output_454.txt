Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  76   1  62  70
1  79   6  62  61  38
2  54  57  70  69  28
3  90  45  13  57  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items. In this context, we will use a simple approach to allocate items in such a way that each agent receives items with relatively higher valuations according to their perspective. 

Given the valuations, we proceed as follows:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 and item 1 highly.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 highly, but agent 0 values this item higher, so we consider item 2 or item 3 for them.
3. **Agent 2** has a fairly distributed valuation, but item 2 is particularly valued by them.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 and item 4 highly, but agent 0 values item 0 higher, so item 4 is a good choice for them.

Based on this reasoning, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 1 (highest combined valuation for these items).
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (next best choice for them after considering agent 0's preference).
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (highest value item for agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (highest value remaining item for agent 3).

This allocation gives each agent items that they value relatively highly compared to the others, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
