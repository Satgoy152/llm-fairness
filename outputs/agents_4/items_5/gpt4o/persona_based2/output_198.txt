Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  92  61  39  34
1  64   2  72  72  76
2  93  47  13  71  12
3  29   3  86   1  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 92 61 39 34]
 [64  2 72 72 76]
 [93 47 13 71 12]
 [29  3 86  1 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use the "Max-Min Fair" method, which attempts to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents.

Let's look at the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  92  61  39  34
1  64   2  72  72  76
2  93  47  13  71  12
3  29   3  86   1  60
```

We need to assign the items (0 to 4) to the four agents (0 to 3) in such a way that the allocations are as fair as possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation of 93 for item 0. To minimize envy, allocate item 0 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 at 92. Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation of 86 for item 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 3.
4. **Agent 1** values items 3 and 4 at 72 and 76, respectively. Allocate item 4 to agent 1, as it has the highest value for agent 1.
5. Now, only item 3 remains. The highest valuation remaining for item 3 is 71 by agent 2, but since agent 2 already has one item, consider agent 1's valuation. Allocate item 3 to agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation strives to minimize envy based on the given valuations.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest individual valuations and attempts to distribute items in a manner that reduces potential envy among agents.
