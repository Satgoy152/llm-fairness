Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  80   4   7  39
1  58  49  29  83  83
2   2   2  93  66  58
3  22  86  76  14  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 49 29 83 83]
 [ 2  2 93 66 58]
 [22 86 76 14 60]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for envy-freeness, ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. The challenge is to allocate the 5 items to the 4 agents such that the allocations are as balanced as possible according to their valuations.

To begin, let's examine the valuation matrix and identify potential allocations that could lead to envy-freeness:

```
Valuation Matrix:
    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  80   4   7  39
1  58  49  29  83  83
2   2   2  93  66  58
3  22  86  76  14  60
```

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 93. Allocating item 2 to agent 2 makes sense, as it's their most valued item.

2. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 83. Allocating item 3 to agent 1 is a suitable match.

3. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 86. Allocating item 1 to agent 3 aligns with their preference.

4. **Items 0 and 4**: Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 0 (34) and item 4 (39). Allocating items 0 and 4 to agent 0 balances the allocation, as agent 0 values these two items highly compared to other agents.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy, as each agent receives at least one high-value item according to their preferences.

### Allocation JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that are valued highly according to their individual valuations, while distributing all 5 items among the 4 agents.
