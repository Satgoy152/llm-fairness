Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  80  35  93  80
1  18  68  61  58  95
2  47  41  14  11  10
3  58  17  86  96  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 80 35 93 80]
 [18 68 61 58 95]
 [47 41 14 11 10]
 [58 17 86 96 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where each agent receives items such that their valuations are as balanced as possible, considering the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and exactly five items must be allocated in total.

### Valuations Table:
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  80  35  93  80
1  18  68  61  58  95
2  47  41  14  11  10
3  58  17  86  96  43
```

### Allocation Strategy:
To achieve envy-freeness and a fair division, we can consider each agent's highest valuation items and try to allocate them such that no agent feels another has received a significantly better allocation. We also aim to ensure that each agent's total valuation for their allocated items is as close as possible, given the constraints.

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 highest (93), then items 1 and 4 equally (80).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 highest (95), then item 2 (61).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 highest (47), then item 1 (41).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highest (96), then item 2 (86).

Based on these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [1, 3]. This gives a total valuation of 80 + 93 = 173.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item [4]. This gives a total valuation of 95.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item [0]. This gives a total valuation of 47.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item [2]. This gives a total valuation of 86.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and the total number of items allocated is 5.
