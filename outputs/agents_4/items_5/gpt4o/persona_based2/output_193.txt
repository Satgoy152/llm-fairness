Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  16  31  66  47
1  95  53  60  64   0
2  97  44  53  11  89
3  49   0  38  68  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 44 53 11 89]
 [49  0 38 68 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can utilize the concept of the "round-robin" method or similar mechanisms to ensure each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they received a valuable allocation based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [3, 16, 31, 66, 47]
Agent 1: [95, 53, 60, 64, 0]
Agent 2: [97, 44, 53, 11, 89]
Agent 3: [49, 0, 38, 68, 17]
```

By analyzing these valuations, we can make allocations to minimize envy:

1. **Allocate the highest valued item for each agent first, ensuring no conflicts.**
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (95), but it's already taken by Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (66).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (68), but it's already taken by Agent 0.

2. **Next, allocate the second highest valued item for each agent.**
   - Agent 1 can take item 2 (60) since item 0 is taken.
   - Agent 3 can take item 4 (17) since item 3 is taken.

3. **Allocate the remaining items.**
   - The remaining item is 1. Assign it to Agent 1 to balance their overall value.

Following this allocation process:

- Agent 0 gets item 3
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 1
- Agent 2 gets item 0
- Agent 3 gets item 4

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent. Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
