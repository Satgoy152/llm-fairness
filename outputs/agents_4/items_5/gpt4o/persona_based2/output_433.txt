Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  17  87   7  23
1  36  55  21  13  41
2  10   0  69  32  51
3  62  58  45  87  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[33 17 87  7 23]
 [36 55 21 13 41]
 [10  0 69 32 51]
 [62 58 45 87 86]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, where each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring envy-freeness. Given the valuations, we want to allocate the 5 items in a way that tries to ensure each agent feels their allocation is fair relative to the others.

Here's the table again for ease of reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  17  87   7  23
1  36  55  21  13  41
2  10   0  69  32  51
3  62  58  45  87  86
```

A possible fair allocation that considers both maximum valuations and distribution is:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 87).
- Agent 1 gets item 1 and 4 (values 55 and 41).
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 32).
- Agent 3 gets item 0 (value 62).

This allocation ensures that each agent is getting at least one of the higher valued items according to their preferences and that the distribution is as balanced as possible given the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
