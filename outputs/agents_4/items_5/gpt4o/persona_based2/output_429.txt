Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  19  97   1  28
1  79   1   1  74  26
2  96  53  65  36  62
3  90  29  33  96  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation to the extent possible given the matrix of valuations. Envy-freeness implies that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Let's start by examining the agents' valuations for each item to attempt to find an allocation that minimizes envy:

| Items | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Agent 3 |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0     | 71      | 79      | 96      | 90      |
| 1     | 19      | 1       | 53      | 29      |
| 2     | 97      | 1       | 65      | 33      |
| 3     | 1       | 74      | 36      | 96      |
| 4     | 28      | 26      | 62      | 33      |

Based on the valuations, we will try to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. **Item 0**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (96).
2. **Item 1**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (53).
3. **Item 2**: Valued highest by Agent 0 (97).
4. **Item 3**: Valued highest by Agent 3 (96).
5. **Item 4**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (62), but since Agent 2 already has two items, we can allocate this to the next highest, which is Agent 0 (28) to balance distribution.

With these allocations, let's check if the distribution is balanced and fair. Agent 2 initially has more items, but reallocating Item 4 to Agent 0 balances the number of items per agent.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

Agent 1 receives no items because they have the lowest valuation for most items. However, this allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent who values it relatively highly, considering the constraints of integer allocations and the need to distribute five items.
