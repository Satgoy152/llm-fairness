Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  24  61  24  83
1  51  68  73  29  91
2  42  86   2  60   7
3  34  62  93  11  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. 

Let's examine the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 61
  - Item 3: 24
  - Item 4: 83

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 29
  - Item 4: 91

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 2
  - Item 3: 60
  - Item 4: 7

- **Agent 3**: 
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 62
  - Item 2: 93
  - Item 3: 11
  - Item 4: 96

Our goal is to distribute the five items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their individual valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 4** (highest value for Agent 1 and Agent 3):
   - Give to Agent 3 (value 96).

2. **Item 2** (highest value for Agent 3):
   - Give to Agent 3 (value 93).

3. **Item 1** (highest value for Agent 2):
   - Give to Agent 2 (value 86).

4. **Item 0** (highest value for Agent 1):
   - Give to Agent 1 (value 51).

5. **Item 3** (remaining item):
   - Give to Agent 0 (value 24).

This allocation considers each agent's highest valuations and attempts to minimize envy. Agent 3 receives two high-value items, while the other agents receive their next highest available items.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item based on their preferences.
