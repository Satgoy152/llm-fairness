Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83   5  70  81  78
1   0  94  87  22  52
2  93  82  12  99  85
3  70  48  13  71  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items so that no agent feels another agent received a better allocation, if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 0:83, 1:5, 2:70, 3:81, 4:78
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 0:0, 1:94, 2:87, 3:22, 4:52
- Agent 2 values items as follows: 0:93, 1:82, 2:12, 3:99, 4:85
- Agent 3 values items as follows: 0:70, 1:48, 2:13, 3:71, 4:84

A fair allocation should aim to balance the total perceived value for each agent. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign item 1** to Agent 1: Agent 1 values item 1 the most highly (94).
2. **Assign item 3** to Agent 2: Agent 2 values item 3 the most highly (99).
3. **Assign item 0** to Agent 2: Agent 2 values item 0 highly (93), and Agent 0's highest value item is item 0 as well, but Agent 2 values it higher.
4. **Assign item 4** to Agent 3: Agent 3 values item 4 highly (84).
5. **Assign item 2** to Agent 0: Agent 0 values item 2 (70) more than Agent 3 does, and Agent 1 has already received their highest priority item.

This allocation strategy ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value relatively well, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance perceived value, respecting each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints of discrete item distribution.
