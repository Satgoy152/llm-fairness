Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  31   3  75  61
1   7  74  51  15  83
2  29  42  60  54   3
3  76  68  92  54   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for every item. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received their fair share based on their personal valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (75).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (83).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (60).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (92).

Given these valuations, a potential allocation strategy is to initially assign each agent their most valued item and then consider the remaining items to balance the allocation. However, because both Agent 2 and Agent 3 highly value item 2, we need to resolve this overlap to ensure fairness.

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (since they value it the most).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (they value it the most).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (they value it the most among all, and it's their highest valued item).

Now, consider the remaining items (0 and 1):

- Agent 0 has item 3, so we should look for their next highest valued item from the remaining, which is item 1.
- Agent 1 has item 4, so they don't need another item.
- Agent 2 doesnâ€™t have any items yet, so we assign them item 0, which is their next highest value among the remaining.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item they highly value or their next best option, creating a sense of fairness:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

In this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, with the aim of minimizing envy among the agents based on their valuations.
