Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  98  31  16  68
1   5  23  20  30   8
2  77  61  94  78  65
3  66  79  69  87  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider approaches that minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an allocation that reflects their preferences as closely as possible. The goal is to achieve an envy-free allocation, or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints.

We have 4 agents and 5 items, so at least one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each. One approach is to use the maximum Nash welfare solution, which aims to maximize the product of the utilities (valuations) received by each agent.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items:

### Valuations Matrix
```
Agent \ Item  | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4
---------------------------------------
0             | 39 | 98 | 31 | 16 | 68
1             | 5  | 23 | 20 | 30 | 8
2             | 77 | 61 | 94 | 78 | 65
3             | 66 | 79 | 69 | 87 | 65
```

### Steps for Allocation:
1. **Identify High Valuation Items**: 
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values 98, Agent 3 values 79.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values 94.

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Utility**:
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value).
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 (highest value).
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (second highest value after its high value on item 2).
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (second highest value after its high value on item 1).

3. **Review Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 4
   - Agent 1: No items (less competitive valuations)
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 2
   - Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation aims to maximize the individual satisfaction of the agents by assigning each item to the agent that values it most, while keeping the allocation envy-minimized.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while reflecting the agents' valuations as closely as possible.
