Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56   7  54  13  37
1  77  72  82  37  50
2  61  36  60  66  21
3  17  83  11  33  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56  7 54 13 37]
 [77 72 82 37 50]
 [61 36 60 66 21]
 [17 83 11 33 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a manner that minimizes envy, we can use an algorithm like the "envy-free up to one item" approach. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as others' allocations, up to removing one item from someone else's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations and find a fair division:

### Valuations Table:
- **Agent 0**: [56, 7, 54, 13, 37]
- **Agent 1**: [77, 72, 82, 37, 50]
- **Agent 2**: [61, 36, 60, 66, 21]
- **Agent 3**: [17, 83, 11, 33, 59]

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 2. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 3. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 1. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. One item left, item 4. It can be assigned to Agent 1 as they value it the second highest after their first choice.

### Final Allocation:
This allocation ensures that every agent gets at least one of their higher-valued items, and the division is envy-free up to one item.

{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
