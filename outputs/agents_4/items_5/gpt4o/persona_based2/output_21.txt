Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  98  32  10  17
1  19  38  74  10   7
2  20  10  71  53  56
3  10  91  77  68  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 98 32 10 17]
 [19 38 74 10  7]
 [20 10 71 53 56]
 [10 91 77 68 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible based on the agents' valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [91, 98, 32, 10, 17]
- Agent 1: [19, 38, 74, 10, 7]
- Agent 2: [20, 10, 71, 53, 56]
- Agent 3: [10, 91, 77, 68, 55]

A reasonable approach is to aim for an allocation where each agent gets items that they value highly compared to others, minimizing possible envy.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1: Valuation is 98 (highest for agent 0, and only agent 3 values it equally high)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2: Valuation is 74 (highest for agent 1)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4: Valuation is 56 (highest for agent 2)
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 0: Valuation is 91 (highest for agent 3, same as agent 0 but agent 0 gets a higher-valued item 1)
   - Item 3: Valuation is 68 (highest for agent 3)

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item they value highly, minimizing the possibility of envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
