Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  77  98  83  49
1  46  37  74  35  15
2  37  80  16  62  29
3  98  10   3  15   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To approach this problem, we'll aim to allocate the items to the agents in such a way that the allocation is as fair as possible, taking into account the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent to their own bundle.

One way to achieve a fair allocation is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum value that any agent receives, also known as the maximin fairness criterion. We want each agent to feel that they have received a fair share.

Let's consider each agent's total valuation for the items:

- Agent 0: [21, 77, 98, 83, 49]
- Agent 1: [46, 37, 74, 35, 15]
- Agent 2: [37, 80, 16, 62, 29]
- Agent 3: [98, 10, 3, 15, 5]

The sum of valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 328
- Agent 1: 207
- Agent 2: 224
- Agent 3: 131

The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 98)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 80)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 98)
- Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 1 (values 35 and 15)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to respect the relative valuation of each agent. Let's see the distribution:

- Agent 0 receives item 2, with a value of 98.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4, with a total value of 50.
- Agent 2 receives item 1, with a value of 80.
- Agent 3 receives item 0, with a value of 98.

This allocation is an attempt to balance the values as fairly as possible given the constraint of integer allocations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```
