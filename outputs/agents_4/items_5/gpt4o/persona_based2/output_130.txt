Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10   6  80  90  82
1  11  45  10  23  65
2  32  94   3  80  84
3  95  45  88  93   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that there are 4 agents and 5 items, each agent will not necessarily receive the same number of items, but our goal is to minimize envy.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuation Items**: 
   - Item 3 has high valuations for agents 0 (90) and 3 (93).
   - Item 2 is highly valued by agent 3 (88).
   - Item 1 is highly valued by agent 2 (94).
   - Item 4 is highly valued by agents 0 (82) and 2 (84).
   - Item 0 is highly valued by agent 3 (95).

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 3, as their valuation (93) is the highest.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 2, as their valuation (94) is the highest.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 3, as their valuation (95) is the highest.
   
3. **Remaining Items**:
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0, as their valuation (80) is the highest remaining.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 1, as their valuation (65) is the highest remaining.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives item 2.
   - Agent 1 receives item 4.
   - Agent 2 receives item 1.
   - Agent 3 receives items 0 and 3.

This allocation aims to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest valuations and ensuring that those with the highest preference receive the respective items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
