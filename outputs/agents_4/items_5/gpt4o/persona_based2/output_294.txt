Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  14  91  53  99
1  90  99  23  25  36
2  79  48  88  43  20
3  84  91   2  45  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we will use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, ensuring no agent envies another.

Hereâ€™s the approach:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent should receive at least one item, as the number of agents (4) is less than the number of items (5).
   - We should aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent's allocated items.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Calculate the total valuation for all possible allocations.
   - Consider each agent's highest valued items and try to allocate them in a manner that balances the overall satisfaction across all agents.

3. **Steps to Achieve Envy-Freeness:**
   - Start by assigning each agent their highest valued item where possible.
   - Adjust allocations to ensure the total number of items is 5 and that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to others.

By following these steps, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 99) and item 2 (value 91).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 79).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 91), which is already taken, so next is item 0 (value 84).

Based on this strategy, the allocation that maximizes fairness and reduces envy could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 and 4
- **Agent 1**: Item 3
- **Agent 2**: Item 0
- **Agent 3**: Item 1

This allocation ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent is treated fairly and that the sum of allocated items is exactly 5.
