Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  17  34  93  78
1   7  58  82  95   8
2  87  90  15  60  90
3  90  37  85  86  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 58 82 95  8]
 [87 90 15 60 90]
 [90 37 85 86 79]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent believes they have received a fair share according to their valuations. The concept of envy-freeness suggests that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's first examine the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  17  34  93  78
1   7  58  82  95   8
2  87  90  15  60  90
3  90  37  85  86  79
```

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the concept of maximizing the Nash social welfare, which balances fairness and efficiency. However, to keep it simple and intuitive, we can allocate items to maximize each agent's valuation for the items they receive.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued item for Agent 0 is Item 3 (value 93). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest-valued item for Agent 1 is Item 3 (value 95), but since it's already assigned, we look at the next highest, which is Item 2 (value 82). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest-valued item for Agent 2 is Item 1 (value 90). Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest-valued item for Agent 3 is Item 0 (value 90). Assign Item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, only Item 4 remains unallocated. We need to assign it to one of the agents. Considering the remaining valuations:

- Agent 0: 78
- Agent 1: 8
- Agent 2: 90
- Agent 3: 79

Assign Item 4 to Agent 2, as it maximizes their valuation among the remaining options.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items such that their total valuation is maximized, given the constraints. It provides a fair distribution based on individual preferences, aiming to minimize any potential envy between agents.
