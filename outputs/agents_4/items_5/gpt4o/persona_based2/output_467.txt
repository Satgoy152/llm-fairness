Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  31  41  34  83
1  77  59  34  75  46
2  75  40  72  68  59
3  56  10  54  71  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 59 34 75 46]
 [75 40 72 68 59]
 [56 10 54 71 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a solution that minimizes envy and ensures a balanced distribution based on the agents' valuations. One common approach is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) method, which maximizes the product of utilities for all agents.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [58, 31, 41, 34, 83]
Agent 1: [77, 59, 34, 75, 46]
Agent 2: [75, 40, 72, 68, 59]
Agent 3: [56, 10, 54, 71, 40]
```

We will consider the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to allocate them in a manner that maximizes fairness. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 with 83.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 with 77.
3. **Agent 2** has a preference for item 2 with 72.
4. **Agent 3** prefers item 3 with 71.

This leaves item 1, which is best allocated to an agent who values it the most among those with fewer items:

- Agent 1 values item 1 at 59, which is the highest remaining preference.

Thus, the allocation will be:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.

This allocation is fair in the sense that it attempts to match each agent with at least one of their most valued items while balancing the total distribution of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
