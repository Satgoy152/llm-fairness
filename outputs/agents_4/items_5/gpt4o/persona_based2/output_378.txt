Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  17   5  59  51
1  26  64  92   8  76
2  60  76  13   9  22
3  66  80  16   1  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent maximizes their satisfaction with their allocation given their valuations.

To start, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [26, 17, 5, 59, 51]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [26, 64, 92, 8, 76]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [60, 76, 13, 9, 22]
- Agent 3 values the items as follows: [66, 80, 16, 1, 99]

A possible approach is to allocate the highest-valued item from each agent's perspective, then adjust where necessary to ensure all items are distributed without envy.

1. **Highest Valued Items:**
   - Agent 0's highest value is for item 3.
   - Agent 1's highest value is for item 2.
   - Agent 2's highest value is for item 1.
   - Agent 3's highest value is for item 4.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 3
   - Agent 1: Item 2
   - Agent 2: Item 1
   - Agent 3: Item 4

3. **Verify and Adjust:**
   - Items 0 is left unallocated.
   - Agent 0 also values item 0 equally to item 3.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 to avoid envy.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3
   - Agent 1: Item 2
   - Agent 2: Item 1
   - Agent 3: Item 4

With these allocations, each agent receives items maximizing their individual utilities given the constraints. This should minimize envy and ensure a fair distribution. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
