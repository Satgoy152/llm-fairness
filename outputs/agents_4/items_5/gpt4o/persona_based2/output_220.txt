Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  72  86  58  53
1  69  78  91  21  48
2  84  45  14  92  39
3  30  65  54  72  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86 72 86 58 53]
 [69 78 91 21 48]
 [84 45 14 92 39]
 [30 65 54 72 40]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free or as envy-free as possible allocation. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. With integer allocations and the valuations provided, this can be a challenging task, but we can try to minimize envy.

Let's consider the valuations table provided:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  72  86  58  53
1  69  78  91  21  48
2  84  45  14  92  39
3  30  65  54  72  40
```

We will allocate the items based on maximizing the perceived value for each agent while attempting to minimize envy. The aim is to give each agent items they value highly.

### Considerations for Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations on items 0 and 2 (both 86).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (value 91) and item 1 next (78).
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (value 92).
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the most, but that's already highly valued by Agent 2.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0** can be given item 0, which they value highly.
- **Agent 1** can be given item 2, their highest valued item.
- **Agent 2** can be given item 3, which they value the most.
- **Agent 3** can be given item 1, which is a relatively high value for them.

This leaves item 4, which should be allocated to minimize envy. Let's consider giving it to an agent who values it reasonably but hasn't received their top choice. Agent 1 could be a candidate since they didn't get item 1, which they valued highly.

### Final Allocation:

Hereâ€™s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item they value reasonably highly, with an attempt to minimize envy given the constraints.
