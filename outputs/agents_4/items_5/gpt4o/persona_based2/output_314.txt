Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30   2  78  12  81
1   7  34  56  13  86
2  63  34  81  73   0
3   1  56   3  10  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while focusing on envy-freeness, we must consider the perceived value of each item by each agent. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent envies another's allocation based on their personal valuations.

Here's the valuation matrix for quick reference:

```
Agent\Item   0   1   2   3   4
0            30  2  78  12  81
1            7  34  56  13  86
2            63  34  81  73  0
3            1  56  3  10  33
```

One approach to achieve envy-freeness is to use a round-robin or a sequential allocation method where agents pick items in turns, based on their highest valuation for the remaining items. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0 picks item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 at 81, which is their highest valuation.

2. **Agent 1 picks item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 at 56, which is their highest remaining valuation.

3. **Agent 2 picks item 0**: Agent 2 values item 0 at 63, which is their highest remaining valuation.

4. **Agent 3 picks item 1**: Agent 3 values item 1 at 56, which is their highest remaining valuation.

5. **Agent 2 picks item 3**: Agent 2 values item 3 at 73, which is the highest remaining valuation among all agents.

Now, let's compile the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible, reducing potential envy.
