Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  19  69  34  96
1  12  69  61  85  86
2   3  83  21  33  10
3  87  63  73  12  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 69 61 85 86]
 [ 3 83 21 33 10]
 [87 63 73 12 49]]
Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations, and no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's look at the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: 47, 19, 69, 34, 96
- **Agent 1**: 12, 69, 61, 85, 86
- **Agent 2**: 3, 83, 21, 33, 10
- **Agent 3**: 87, 63, 73, 12, 49

To maximize fairness, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, often referred to as maximizing the minimum envy-free allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is item 4 (96). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is item 3 (85). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is item 1 (83). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is item 0 (87). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, only item 2 remains unallocated. We need to assign it in a way that maintains a fair distribution:

- **Item 2**: The highest remaining valuation for item 2 is by Agent 3 (73). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

This allocation gives each agent their highest possible value from the remaining items, minimizing envy.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, minimizing potential envy among them.
