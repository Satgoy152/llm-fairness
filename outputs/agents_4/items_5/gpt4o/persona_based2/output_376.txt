Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5   8   4  11  87
1  86  86  62  41  30
2  16  38  75  67  35
3  24  21  71  30   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 21 71 30  1]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation minimizes envy, ideally achieving an envy-free distribution if possible.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 5 + 8 + 4 + 11 + 87 = 115
- Agent 1: 86 + 86 + 62 + 41 + 30 = 305
- Agent 2: 16 + 38 + 75 + 67 + 35 = 231
- Agent 3: 24 + 21 + 71 + 30 + 1 = 147

Next, we should consider assigning items to maximize each agent's utility based on their individual valuations, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of value.

A possible allocation strategy is to assign each agent the item they value the most, then allocate remaining items to balance the overall distribution:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item:
   - Agent 0's highest value item: 4 (value 87)
   - Agent 1's highest value item: 0 (value 86)
   - Agent 2's highest value item: 2 (value 75)
   - Agent 3's highest value item: 2 (value 71, but taken by Agent 2, so next highest is 3 with value 30)

2. Reassign items if conflicts arise (as seen with item 2):
   - Agent 2 receives item 2 (value 75)
   - Agent 3 receives item 3 (value 30)

3. Allocate remaining items based on maximizing total value for each agent while ensuring no envy:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 86)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 5)

4. Verify allocation:
   - Agent 0: Items 4, 0 (Total value = 87 + 5 = 92)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (Total value = 86)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (Total value = 75)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 (Total value = 30)

The total number of items allocated is 5, as required. Here's the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
