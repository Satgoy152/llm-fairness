Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  28  10  79  95
1  85  66  54  55  79
2  19  12  61  90  69
3  99  66  22  40  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a manner that is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints, we can use the concept of maximizing individual satisfaction while ensuring that no agent envies another based on their perceived value of the allocation.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
        Items
        0    1    2    3    4
Agents
  0     30   28   10   79   95
  1     85   66   54   55   79
  2     19   12   61   90   69
  3     99   66   22   40   41
```

To begin, we want to allocate the items such that the total value perceived by each agent is balanced, and no agent feels envious of another's allocation. One approach is to allocate based on maximizing individual agent's value for each item while ensuring that overall allocation is fair.

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4 (95), so we assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (85), so we assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (90), so we assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1 (66) and item 3 is already taken, so we assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. The remaining item is 2, which has the highest valuation by Agent 2 (61), but Agent 2 already has item 3. To balance allocation we give item 2 to Agent 3 who will now have items 1 and 2.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 2.

Here are the allocations in json format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide a fair division based on individual preferences, maximizing each agent's satisfaction with what they receive.
