Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  22  50  46  36
1  69  19  58  85  88
2  23  81   2  29   9
3  38  76  84  83  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 22 50 46 36]
 [69 19 58 85 88]
 [23 81  2 29  9]
 [38 76 84 83 55]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we must consider the agents' valuations for each item. One potential approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring proportional fairness. We will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible given the constraints.

Here are the valuations of each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [78, 22, 50, 46, 36]
- Agent 1: [69, 19, 58, 85, 88]
- Agent 2: [23, 81, 2, 29, 9]
- Agent 3: [38, 76, 84, 83, 55]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest value for item 0 (78). We assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 (88) the highest. We assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 (81) the highest. We assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest value for item 2 (84). We assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, all agents have been allocated one item each, leaving item 3 unallocated. We should now allocate item 3 to the agent who values it the most among those who have not yet received their second item. Agents 1 and 3 have the highest valuations for item 3 (85 and 83, respectively), but since Agent 1 values it slightly more, we assign item 3 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [4, 3]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [2]

Now, here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, maintaining a sense of fairness across the group.
