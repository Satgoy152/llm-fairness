Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  11  28  32  62
1  59  26  26  27  48
2  65  43  77  92  83
3  68  90  86  71  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for a division that minimizes envy and achieves a balanced distribution of valuations. One standard approach is to use the "maximum marginal value" method, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 68. (Highest among agents)
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it at 90. (Highest among agents)
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 77. (Highest among agents)
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 92. (Highest among agents)
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 83. (Highest among agents)

With this allocation, we need to ensure each agent gets a fair share. Notice that Agent 2 has been allocated three items, which might cause envy. We can adjust to achieve a more balanced allocation while still being fair:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 3.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation considers the highest valuations while also distributing items fairly among the agents. Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed in a way that reflects their valuations, aiming for a balance between fairness and envy-freeness.
