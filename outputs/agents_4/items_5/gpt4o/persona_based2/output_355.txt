Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  18  78  76  70
1  41  14  66  74  10
2   9  90  26  54  50
3  81  65  62  32  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 18 78 76 70]
 [41 14 66 74 10]
 [ 9 90 26 54 50]
 [81 65 62 32 21]]
Output:
To allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents in a way that is as fair as possible, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation, based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations extracted from the table for clarity:

- Agent 0: [52, 18, 78, 76, 70]
- Agent 1: [41, 14, 66, 74, 10]
- Agent 2: [9, 90, 26, 54, 50]
- Agent 3: [81, 65, 62, 32, 21]

We'll approach this by trying to allocate items such that each agent receives the items they value most, ensuring that the total number of items is exactly 5.

1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 0 (81). We'll allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 (90). We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (78). We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (74). We'll allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
5. For item 4, Agent 0 values it at 70, which is the highest valuation for this item. We'll allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, reducing envy and striving for fairness.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 5 items among the 4 agents, and attempts to be as fair as possible given the valuations.
