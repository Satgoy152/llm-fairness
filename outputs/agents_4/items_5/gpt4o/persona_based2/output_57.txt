Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  31  38  27  94
1  55  27  42  38   0
2  57  94  79  62  48
3  81  10  96  26  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. One approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility, also known as the maximin strategy. This involves ensuring that the least happy agent (in terms of their total valuation of allocated items) is as happy as possible.

Let's evaluate different possible allocations and determine which allocation achieves a relatively fair distribution.

First, calculate the sum of valuations for each possible allocation of items to the agents. We will consider allocations that give each agent at least one item and try to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

### Possible Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 4 (94)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (55), Item 2 (42)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (94), Item 2 (79)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (96), Item 4 (85)

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate Item 0 (99)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate Item 3 (38)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate Item 1 (94)
- **Agent 3**: Allocate Item 2 (96) and Item 4 (85)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and items are distributed to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 5 items, with each agent receiving an item and higher valuations being prioritized.
