Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  73  91  71  75
1  26  53  83  33   9
2  59  90  38  70  54
3  57  86  23  13  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87 73 91 71 75]
 [26 53 83 33  9]
 [59 90 38 70 54]
 [57 86 23 13 94]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [87, 73, 91, 71, 75]
Agent 1: [26, 53, 83, 33, 9]
Agent 2: [59, 90, 38, 70, 54]
Agent 3: [57, 86, 23, 13, 94]
```

A simple approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Hereâ€™s an allocation based on the highest valuations:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 87 by Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 90 by Agent 2.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 91 by Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 71 by Agent 2 (Agent 0 already has two items, so we consider Agent 2).
5. Item 4: Highest value is 94 by Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each item goes to an agent that values it highly, minimizing potential envy. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3, and Agent 3 receives item 4. Agent 1 does not receive any items, which might be unavoidable given the specific valuations and the constraint to allocate all items. However, the allocation attempts to maximize fairness based on the given valuations.
