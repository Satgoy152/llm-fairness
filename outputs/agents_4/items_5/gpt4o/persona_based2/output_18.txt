Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  17  46  52  58
1  70   5  56  27   2
2  27  30  61  46  30
3  86  94  75  42  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that aims to be fair and envy-free, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring that each agent's allocation is as close as possible to their best possible outcome given the constraints.

Let's evaluate the problem step by step:

### Valuations Matrix
```
        Items
        0   1   2   3   4
Agents
0      31  17  46  52  58
1      70   5  56  27   2
2      27  30  61  46  30
3      86  94  75  42  15
```

### Approach
1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. 
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0.
   - Agent 0 highly values items 3 and 4.
   - Agent 2 has a more even distribution of valuations across items.

2. **Objective**: 
   - Distribute the items to maximize fairness. This often means ensuring that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Assign high-value items to agents who value them the most when possible.
   - Try to balance the overall utility among agents.

### Allocation Steps
- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 3 (value of 94).
- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 1 (value of 70).
- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 2 (value of 61).
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 0 (value of 52).
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 0 (value of 58).

### Final Allocations
- Agent 0 gets items [3, 4].
- Agent 1 gets item [0].
- Agent 2 gets item [2].
- Agent 3 gets item [1].

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item they value highly, thereby striving for fairness and reducing envy as much as possible given the constraints of integer allocations and the total set of items.

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
