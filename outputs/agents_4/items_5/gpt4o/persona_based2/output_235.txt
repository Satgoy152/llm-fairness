Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  84  60  59  93
1  86  36  88  15  54
2  82  57  15  10   9
3  92  68  82  26  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents in a way that minimizes envy and is efficient. The goal is to achieve a fair allocation considering each agent's valuation of each item.

Let's explore a possible allocation scenario:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 4 the most (93), followed by item 1 (84). Assigning item 4 to Agent 0 will give them a high-value item.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the most (88), followed by item 0 (86). Assigning item 2 to Agent 1 will satisfy their highest preference.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent's highest valuation is for item 0 (82), followed by item 1 (57). Since item 0 is still available, assign it to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 the most (92), but it's already assigned. The next best is item 2 (82), which is also assigned. The next highest is item 1 (68). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have items 3 and 4 left. But item 4 is already assigned to Agent 0. Therefore, item 3 can be assigned to Agent 1, who has the lowest value for it but still benefits the most from receiving another item.

This allocation ensures that:

- Each agent gets at least one item.
- The allocation reflects high-priority valuations for each agent where possible, minimizing overall envy.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```
