Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  87  97  36  45
1  95  12  16  89  12
2  72   9  34  82  95
3  27  33  37  51  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 12 16 89 12]
 [72  9 34 82 95]
 [27 33 37 51 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0: [87, 87, 97, 36, 45]
- Agent 1: [95, 12, 16, 89, 12]
- Agent 2: [72, 9, 34, 82, 95]
- Agent 3: [27, 33, 37, 51, 28]

To achieve an allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. **Highest Valuation Assignment**: Initially, allocate items based on each agent's highest valuation to ensure they receive something valuable to them.
2. **Adjust for Fairness**: Adjust the allocation to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation by trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with assigning items:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (97). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (95). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (95). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (51). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have assigned items 0, 2, 3, and 4. Item 1 is unassigned.

- **Agent 0** also values item 1 highly (87), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item that they value highly and attempts to keep envy minimal. 

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
