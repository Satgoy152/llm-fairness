Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  82   4  68  88
1  23  30  79  20  51
2  18  62  91  41  17
3  56  72  76   8  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 82  4 68 88]
 [23 30 79 20 51]
 [18 62 91 41 17]
 [56 72 76  8 94]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use various methods, but a simple approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
     0   1   2   3   4
0  36  82   4  68  88
1  23  30  79  20  51
2  18  62  91  41  17
3  56  72  76   8  94
```

We need to allocate the 5 items (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) to the 4 agents (0, 1, 2, 3) such that the allocation is as fair as possible. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 highly (88) and item 1 (82) as well.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 highly (79).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (91), but since agent 1 has claimed it, let's choose the next best available item for agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly (94), but since agent 0 has claimed it, agent 3 will get the second best available item.

After exploring these preferences, the allocation can be as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 1 and Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 0

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5. Now, I will present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
