Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  79  11  66  74
1  42  58  45  51  23
2  92   6  53  35  55
3  87  22  71  89  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can employ a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method. This approach lets each agent pick their most valued item in rounds until all items are allocated. Given the valuations, we will proceed as follows:

1. Determine the order of selection. Typically, this can be randomized or based on some priority. For simplicity, let's assume the order of agent selection is 0, 1, 2, 3.

2. Each agent picks their most valuable item from the remaining unallocated items.

Let's go through the rounds:

- **Round 1:**
  - Agent 0 selects item 0 (value 81).
  - Agent 1 selects item 1 (value 58).
  - Agent 2 selects item 0 (already taken, so next highest value is item 2, value 53).
  - Agent 3 selects item 3 (value 89).

- **Round 2:**
  - Agent 0 selects item 4 (value 74, since item 0 is already taken).
  - Agent 1 selects item 3 (already taken, so next highest value is item 0, value 42).

At this point, all items have been allocated. Hereâ€™s the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets their most preferred available items during their turn, which is a common approach to strive for fairness and minimize envy.
