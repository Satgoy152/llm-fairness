Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  87  90  60  95
1  13  39  82   0  54
2  54  79  35  33  51
3  58  85  15  20  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 87 90 60 95]
 [13 39 82  0 54]
 [54 79 35 33 51]
 [58 85 15 20 34]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent gets a similar level of satisfaction based on their valuations. Given the valuations:

```
Valuations Table:
    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  87  90  60  95
1  13  39  82   0  54
2  54  79  35  33  51
3  58  85  15  20  34
```

Let's evaluate the items and allocate them based on maximizing the total satisfaction while trying to avoid any significant envy.

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (77)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (87)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (90)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (60)
   - Next highest value: Agent 2 (33)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (95)
   - Next highest value: Agent 1 (54)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

Here is the optimal allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": []
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2, maximizing their high valuation satisfaction.
- Agent 1 receives item 4, which is the next best option for them.
- Agent 2 receives item 3, which is their highest valuation among the remaining options.
- Agent 3 does not receive any items due to their relatively low valuations compared to others on the most valued items. However, this allocation minimizes envy among the agents who received items.
