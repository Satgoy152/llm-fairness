Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  58  15  90  83
1  71  50  13  58  93
2  26  56  64   3  30
3  61  36  11  11  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88 58 15 90 83]
 [71 50 13 58 93]
 [26 56 64  3 30]
 [61 36 11 11 83]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items that maximize their individual utility while also considering the overall distribution to be as equitable as possible.

First, let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [88, 58, 15, 90, 83]
- Agent 1: [71, 50, 13, 58, 93]
- Agent 2: [26, 56, 64, 3, 30]
- Agent 3: [61, 36, 11, 11, 83]

We will use a simple assignment strategy that considers both the highest valuations and the potential for envy.

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (90). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (93). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most (64). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most (83), but it is already assigned to Agent 1. The next highest is item 0 (61). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, only item 1 is left unallocated. To determine the best allocation for item 1, we consider:

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 58.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 50.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 56.
- Agent 3 values item 1 at 36.

The highest remaining valuation for item 1 is from Agent 0. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

With these allocations, all items have been assigned:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 1
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's utility based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
