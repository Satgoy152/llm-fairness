Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  94  24  42   9
1   0  24  90  55  20
2  65  15  99   3   4
3  67  38  58  86  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging with discrete items and unequal valuations, but we can attempt to approximate it as closely as possible.

Let's examine the valuations and try to distribute the items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0 valuations**: [32, 94, 24, 42, 9]
2. **Agent 1 valuations**: [0, 24, 90, 55, 20]
3. **Agent 2 valuations**: [65, 15, 99, 3, 4]
4. **Agent 3 valuations**: [67, 38, 58, 86, 33]

**Allocation Strategy:**

- **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (67). Assign Item 0 to Agent 3.
- **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (94). Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (99). Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (86). Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (33), but since Agent 3 already has two items, assign Item 4 to Agent 1 who has the next highest valuation (20).

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item they value highly, considering their preferences as much as possible.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value relatively highly, and all 5 items are distributed without exceeding the item limit per agent.
