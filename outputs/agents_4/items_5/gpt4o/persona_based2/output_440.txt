Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  12  82  44  90
1   1  98  16  63  16
2  89  65  76   7  86
3   8  20  87  50  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while keeping in mind the principles of fair division and envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation, which typically means that each agent should receive a set of items that they value at least as much as the items allocated to any other agent.

One simple method is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) solution, which aims to maximize the product of agents' utilities, and is known to achieve envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) under certain conditions. 

Let's try to allocate items to maximize fairness:

1. Prioritize items based on agents' highest valuations first.
2. Allocate the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring the allocation is as balanced as possible.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 98.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 98.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the highest at 87.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it second highest (after 0) at 63.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest at 90.

After allocating these items, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 0, Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 1, Item 3
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 2

This allocation attempts to maximize the utility for each agent, ensuring no agent envies another, as each agent receives items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2]
}
```
