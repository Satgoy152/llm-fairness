Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  83  28  35  34
1  73  14   0  84  86
2  61  75  64  43  17
3  59  73  87  33  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that aims to minimize envy, we can consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. One method to achieve this is by using the "maximum envy-free" approach, where we attempt to ensure each agent receives a bundle of items that, according to their own valuations, is as good as possible given the constraints.

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the highest. If possible, we should give this item to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the highest, so we should try to allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 the highest, but since we are giving item 1 to Agent 0, we can consider their next highest, item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the highest, but since we plan to give item 2 to Agent 2, we consider their next highest, item 1, which is already taken, so we move to item 0.

To ensure the allocation is fair and all items are distributed, let's optimize the remaining assignments:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives item 0.

This leaves item 3 unallocated. We can give item 3 to Agent 1, who values it highly after item 4.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to respect the highest valuations as much as possible.
