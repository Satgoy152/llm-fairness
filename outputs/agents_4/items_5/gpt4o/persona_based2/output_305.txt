Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  68  52  35  73
1  55  27  28  77  10
2  62   8  86   2  89
3  81  72  99  77  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 27 28 77 10]
 [62  8 86  2 89]
 [81 72 99 77 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation minimizes envy and maximizes the perceived fairness. A common approach is to use an envy-free allocation method, ensuring that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own.

### Agent Valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 91     | 68     | 52     | 35     | 73     |
| 1     | 55     | 27     | 28     | 77     | 10     |
| 2     | 62     | 8      | 86     | 2      | 89     |
| 3     | 81     | 72     | 99     | 77     | 11     |

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Select Allocations by Highest Valuations:**
   - **Agent 3** values Item 2 very highly at 99, so they should receive Item 2.
   - **Agent 2** values Item 4 the most at 89, so they should receive Item 4.
   - **Agent 0** values Item 0 the most at 91, so they should receive Item 0.
   - **Agent 1** values Item 3 the most at 77, so they should receive Item 3.

These allocations ensure that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, hence reducing the overall envy between agents.

2. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Item 1 is left, and its highest valuation is by Agent 3 at 72. Assign Item 1 to Agent 3 to increase their total perceived value, ensuring they do not envy other allocations.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 1

### Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation respects the agents' highest preferences as much as possible and ensures each agent receives at least one item they value significantly.
