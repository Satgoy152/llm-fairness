Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  34   4  56  70
1  98  27  55  93  13
2  76   3  79  86  19
3  68  54  43  58  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86 34  4 56 70]
 [98 27 55 93 13]
 [76  3 79 86 19]
 [68 54 43 58 76]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their valuations while ensuring no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here are the steps to achieve such an allocation:

1. **Evaluate each agent's highest valuation items**: Identify which items each agent values the most.

2. **Prioritize assignments based on highest valuations**: Allocate items starting with the highest valuations to ensure agents receive their most desired items as far as possible.

3. **Ensure all items are distributed**: Since there are more agents than items, some agents may not receive any items, but we must ensure each item is assigned to one agent.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  34   4  56  70
1  98  27  55  93  13
2  76   3  79  86  19
3  68  54  43  58  76
```

- **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (86), followed by item 4 (70).
- **Agent 1** values item 0 the most (98), followed by item 3 (93).
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (86), followed by item 2 (79).
- **Agent 3** values item 4 the most (76), followed by item 1 (54).

Let's allocate the items:

- Assign **item 0** to **Agent 1**, as they have the highest valuation for this item (98).
- Assign **item 3** to **Agent 2**, as they have the highest valuation for this item (86).
- Assign **item 4** to **Agent 0**, as they have the second highest valuation for this item (70).
- Assign **item 1** to **Agent 3**, as they have the highest valuation for this item (54).
- Assign **item 2** to **Agent 2**, as they have the highest remaining valuation for this item (79) and it ensures they receive multiple items based on their preferences.

Thus, the allocation of items will be:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to one agent, and the agents receive bundles of items that maximize their valuations based on their preferences, given the constraints.
