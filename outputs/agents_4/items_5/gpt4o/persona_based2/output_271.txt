Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  24  70  47  70
1  36  13  93  42  54
2  50  49  67   1  75
3  73  96  73  49   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 24 70 47 70]
 [36 13 93 42 54]
 [50 49 67  1 75]
 [73 96 73 49  6]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim to minimize envy and try to ensure each agent receives items that maximize their respective valuations. We will use the concept of maximum total valuation sum for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuations are for item 0 (93), item 2 (70), and item 4 (70).
   
2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (93).
   
3. **Agent 2's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (75).
   
4. **Agent 3's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuations are for item 1 (96) and item 0 (73).

**Allocation Plan:**

- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 1 since it's their highest-valued item (93).
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 2 since it's their highest-valued item (75).
- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 3 since it's their highest-valued item (96).
- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 0 since it's their highest-valued item (93).
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 3 since they have a relatively high value for it and it balances their allocations.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item while trying to minimize envy.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
