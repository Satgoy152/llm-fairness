Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  91  97  39  13
1  69  54  71   5  80
2  55  40  54  28  68
3  90  67  45  48  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a division where each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations. A common goal in fair division is to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

One simple approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the concept of "maximum valuation," where we try to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

### Valuations Table

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Agent 3 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 99      | 69      | 55      | 90      |
| 1    | 91      | 54      | 40      | 67      |
| 2    | 97      | 71      | 54      | 45      |
| 3    | 39      | 5       | 28      | 48      |
| 4    | 13      | 80      | 68      | 69      |

### Allocation Process

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from Agent 0 at 99. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from Agent 0 at 91. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from Agent 0 at 97. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from Agent 3 at 48. Allocate to Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from Agent 1 at 80. Allocate to Agent 1.

This allocation results in Agent 0 receiving items 0, 1, and 2, Agent 1 receiving item 4, and Agent 3 receiving item 3. Agent 2 receives no items.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that items are distributed according to the highest valuations, which is one approach to achieving a fair division based on agents' preferences.
