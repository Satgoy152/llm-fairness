Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  28  14  91  77
1  36  82  18  45  55
2  49  36  30   3  99
3  38  35  40  46  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[20 28 14 91 77]
 [36 82 18 45 55]
 [49 36 30  3 99]
 [38 35 40 46 38]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free division. This means each agent should feel that they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [20, 28, 14, 91, 77]
Agent 1: [36, 82, 18, 45, 55]
Agent 2: [49, 36, 30, 3, 99]
Agent 3: [38, 35, 40, 46, 38]
```

We can employ an approach where we consider each agent's highest valued items while ensuring no envy:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value items are 3 (91) and 4 (77). Allocating item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value item is 1 (82). Allocating item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value item is 4 (99), but item 4 is already taken by Agent 0. Second highest is item 0 (49). Allocating item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value item is 2 (40). Allocating item 2 to Agent 3.

Now we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, and 3. The remaining item is 4.

5. **Item 4:** This item is left. We consider the remaining valuations and choose to allocate it to the agent with the highest remaining valuation for this item. Agent 2 values item 4 at 99, which is highest across all agents for unallocated items. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]
- Agent 3: [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
