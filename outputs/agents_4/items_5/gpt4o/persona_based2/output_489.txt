Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  45  90   9  43
1  67  84  28  71  45
2  65  14  29  32  44
3  26  99   9  51  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[59 45 90  9 43]
 [67 84 28 71 45]
 [65 14 29 32 44]
 [26 99  9 51 11]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, i.e., where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  45  90   9  43
1  67  84  28  71  45
2  65  14  29  32  44
3  26  99   9  51  11
```

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation Items:**
   - Each agent gets priority for an item they value highly compared to others.
   
2. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value: Item 2 (90)
   
3. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value: Item 1 (84)
   
4. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value: Item 0 (65)

5. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value: Item 3 (51)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (Item 4) considering minimal envy:

- **Item 4:** 
  - Valuations: Agent 0 (43), Agent 1 (45), Agent 2 (44), Agent 3 (11)
  - Best fit: Assign to Agent 1 (45) to minimize envy.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation considers the highest valuations and tries to minimize envy. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
