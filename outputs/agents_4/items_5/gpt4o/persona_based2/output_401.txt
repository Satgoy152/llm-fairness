Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  44  23  12   6
1  76   9  31  36  89
2  21  49  25  95  35
3  53  17  89   1  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free division where each agent feels they received the best possible allocation given their own valuations. A common approach to achieve this is to use methods like the adjusted winner procedure, but for simplicity and given the constraints, we can try to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's consider the valuations of each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [54, 44, 23, 12, 6]
- Agent 1: [76, 9, 31, 36, 89]
- Agent 2: [21, 49, 25, 95, 35]
- Agent 3: [53, 17, 89, 1, 24]

We'll allocate items to maximize the value each agent receives, ensuring all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (89), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (95), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (89), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (54), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
5. The remaining item is 1. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (49), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction given their valuations.
