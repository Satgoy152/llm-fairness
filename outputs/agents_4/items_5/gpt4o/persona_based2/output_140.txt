Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68   8  96  62  30
1  52  97  67  36   3
2  35  94  55  40  36
3  31  78  99  99  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we want to allocate the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible. A common criterion of fairness is to minimize envy, where an allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle. 

Given the valuations, we can try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives, while trying to minimize potential envyness.

Let's analyze:

- Agent 0 values Item 2 highly (96) and Item 0 (68).
- Agent 1 values Item 1 highly (97).
- Agent 2 values Item 1 highly (94).
- Agent 3 values Item 2 (99) and Item 3 (99) highly.

We can attempt the following allocation:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it the most.
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 3 because they value it highly.
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because they value it highly.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 3, as they value it the highest.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 to ensure they receive some value and to balance the allocation.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1.
- Agent 2 gets Item 4.
- Agent 3 gets Items 2 and 3.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the values received by each agent and minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints.
