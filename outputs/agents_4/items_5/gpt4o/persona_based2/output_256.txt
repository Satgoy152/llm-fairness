Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  18  13  64  12
1  22  71  24   4  32
2  31  73  56  77  23
3  18  35  17  22  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 73 56 77 23]
 [18 35 17 22 56]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation based on envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we need to consider different combinations to ensure fairness and efficiency.

Let's evaluate the situation:

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [24, 18, 13, 64, 12]
- Agent 1: [22, 71, 24, 4, 32]
- Agent 2: [31, 73, 56, 77, 23]
- Agent 3: [18, 35, 17, 22, 56]

### Key Observations:
- Agent 0 highly values item 3.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 3 and item 1.
- Agent 3 highly values item 4.

### Proposed Fair Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 and item 0 (second-highest valuation of item 2 and item 0 is not in direct competition with othersâ€™ top choices).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 (highest value for Agent 3).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that are aligned with their highest valuations or close to their highest, thus minimizing envy among agents.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing envy and ensuring each agent is as satisfied as possible given the constraints.
