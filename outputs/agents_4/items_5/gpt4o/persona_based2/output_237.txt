Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  26  32  72  88
1  92  18  74  29  28
2  71   9  13  72  58
3  56  78   5  51  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 78  5 51 81]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual satisfaction while seeking to minimize envy among agents. An envy-free allocation is not always possible in all scenarios, but we can strive for a fair division. In this case, we will try to allocate the items such that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, while considering their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [90, 26, 32, 72, 88]
Agent 1: [92, 18, 74, 29, 28]
Agent 2: [71, 9, 13, 72, 58]
Agent 3: [56, 78, 5, 51, 81]
```

A possible fair allocation, considering the valuations, could be:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 highly (90), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 highly (74), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 highly (72, tied with Agent 0), but since item 0 is already allocated, we'll assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 highly (78), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. The remaining item, item 4, is valued highly by Agent 0 (88) and Agent 3 (81), but since Agent 0 has already received item 0, we'll allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives an item they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly, considering the preferences of the agents.
