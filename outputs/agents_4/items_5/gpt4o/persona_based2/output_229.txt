Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  78  68  64  52
1   2  58  70  81  29
2  69  19  74  48  84
3  20  72   7  94  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy between agents by ensuring each agent values their allocated items highly. A common approach is to use an envy-free allocation method, such as the adjusted winner procedure or other heuristic methods, to attempt to find a fair distribution.

Given the valuations, we can try to allocate the items such that each agent has a relatively high total value for their allocated items compared to other possible allocations. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (69)
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (78)
   
3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (74)
   
4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (94)
   
5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (84)

This initial allocation gives Agent 2 three items, which may not be as balanced. Let's adjust to ensure a more even distribution:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 also values it highly (55).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (since Agent 0 already has Item 0).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

This gives us:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, aiming to achieve a fair and envy-free distribution based on the given valuations.

Now presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
