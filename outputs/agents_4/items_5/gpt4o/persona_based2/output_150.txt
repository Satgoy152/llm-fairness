Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  60  70  21  23
1  20  32  89  76   1
2  96  53  88  71  51
3  82   0  17  16  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[48 60 70 21 23]
 [20 32 89 76  1]
 [96 53 88 71 51]
 [82  0 17 16 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that mitigates envy and ensures each agent receives at least one item. This allocation will be guided by maximizing total valuations and attempting to balance the fairness perception among agents. To achieve this, we can use the "maximum sum of valuations" principle as a guideline and consider each agent's highest-valued items.

Looking at the table:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [48, 60, 70, 21, 23]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [20, 32, 89, 76, 1]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [96, 53, 88, 71, 51]
- Agent 3 values items as follows: [82, 0, 17, 16, 79]

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 0, with a valuation of 96.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2, with a valuation of 89.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 2, but since it's already allocated, we consider the next highest, which is item 1 with a valuation of 60.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 4, with a valuation of 79.
5. For the remaining item, item 3, **Agent 1** has the second-highest valuation after item 2, with a valuation of 76.

Therefore, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: item 1
- Agent 1: items 2 and 3
- Agent 2: item 0
- Agent 3: item 4

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
