Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93   5  86   9  67
1  47   8  78  73  62
2   8  10  61  18  19
3  97  44  31  64  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [97 44 31 64 21]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We can use a simple fair division heuristic to allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items available. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are [93, 5, 86, 9, 67]. The highest valuation is 93 for Item 0. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are [47, 8, 78, 73, 62]. The highest remaining valuation is 78 for Item 2. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are [8, 10, 61, 18, 19]. The highest remaining valuation is 61 for Item 2, but it is already allocated. The next highest valuation is 19 for Item 4. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are [97, 44, 31, 64, 21]. The highest valuation is 97 for Item 0, but it is already allocated. The next highest valuation is 64 for Item 3. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, only Item 1 remains unallocated. We will assign it to the agent with the least total value from their assigned items to balance the allocation:

- **Agent 2** has only Item 4 valued at 19. 
- **Agent 1** has Item 2 valued at 78.
- **Agent 3** has Item 3 valued at 64.
- **Agent 0** has Item 0 valued at 93.

Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 has the lowest total value from assigned items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to maintain fairness given the constraints.
