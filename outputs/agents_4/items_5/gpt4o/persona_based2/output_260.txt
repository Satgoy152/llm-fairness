Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  26  76  65  91
1  50  70  70   2  16
2  82  70  81  84   6
3  26  26  26  83  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we aim to minimize envy among agents. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, let's attempt to distribute the items to achieve an equitable allocation.

Here's a feasible allocation:
- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 values item 1 and item 2 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 3 and item 0 highly.
- Agent 3 appears to have lower valuations across the board but relatively values item 3 more than others.

Let's test a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it is highly valued.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it is the highest value for this agent.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it is the highest value for this agent.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it's the highest value remaining in comparison to the other agents.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: items 2, 4
- Agent 1: item 1
- Agent 2: item 0
- Agent 3: item 3

This ensures that each agent gets items they value significantly when possible, with some agents getting more than one item due to the relatively high valuation differences. Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly, given the constraints.
