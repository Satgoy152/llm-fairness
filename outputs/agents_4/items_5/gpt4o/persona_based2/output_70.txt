Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  26  38  67  86
1  72  28  43  46  54
2   2  87  46  62  94
3  10  59  86  18  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy among the agents. The envy-freeness concept ensures that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. 

First, let's consider the valuations of each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [23, 26, 38, 67, 86]
- Agent 1: [72, 28, 43, 46, 54]
- Agent 2: [2, 87, 46, 62, 94]
- Agent 3: [10, 59, 86, 18, 43]

We need to assign the 5 items to 4 agents in such a way that each agent gets a non-negative integer number of items.

One approach is to use the method of "maximum valuations," where each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most. This approach will usually help in reducing envy among agents since each agent is receiving at least one of their most valued items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values at 23
   - Agent 1 values at 72 (highest, allocate to Agent 1)
   - Agent 2 values at 2
   - Agent 3 values at 10

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values at 26
   - Agent 1 values at 28
   - Agent 2 values at 87 (highest, allocate to Agent 2)
   - Agent 3 values at 59

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values at 38
   - Agent 1 values at 43
   - Agent 2 values at 46
   - Agent 3 values at 86 (highest, allocate to Agent 3)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values at 67 (highest, allocate to Agent 0)
   - Agent 1 values at 46
   - Agent 2 values at 62
   - Agent 3 values at 18

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values at 86 (highest, allocate to Agent 0)
   - Agent 1 values at 54
   - Agent 2 values at 94 (highest, but Agent 2 already got item 1 which they valued highly)
   - Agent 3 values at 43

Let's review:
- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 2.

This allocation aims to minimize overall envy since each agent gets at least one item they highly value.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
