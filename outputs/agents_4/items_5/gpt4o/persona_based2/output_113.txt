Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10   3  34  87  10
1  72  50  92  33  52
2  86  87  63  73  48
3  25  79  15  22   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations. 

Here's the valuation table for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 10     | 3      | 34     | 87     | 10     |
| 1     | 72     | 50     | 92     | 33     | 52     |
| 2     | 86     | 87     | 63     | 73     | 48     |
| 3     | 25     | 79     | 15     | 22     | 7      |

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: We should seek high values for each agent, as this might lead to a more envy-free allocation:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (87).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (92).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (87).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the second highest (79) after 25 for item 0.

2. **Assign Most Valued Items**: Begin by assigning each agent their most valued item, if possible:
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 cannot get item 1 as it's already assigned, look for next highest available.

3. **Resolve Remaining Items**:
   - Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 2, but Agent 2 has a high value item already, so consider others:
   - Item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value among remaining).
   - Item 4 to Agent 3 (least valued item).

### Final Allocation:

After assigning the items based on the above strategy, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation seeks to minimize envy by ensuring every agent receives at least one of the items they highly value, given the constraint of integer allocations.
