Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  72  79  70  39
1  89  10  98  30  18
2  76  49  78  50  53
3   9  18   6  51  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82 72 79 70 39]
 [89 10 98 30 18]
 [76 49 78 50 53]
 [ 9 18  6 51 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible under the constraints given. Since envy-freeness strives to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, we will try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

The valuations table is as follows:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  72  79  70  39
1  89  10  98  30  18
2  76  49  78  50  53
3   9  18   6  51  71
```

To start, let's consider the highest valuation each agent has for any item and allocate that item to the agent if possible, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once.

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 with a valuation of 98. We allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 with a valuation of 82. We allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** highly values item 4 with a valuation of 71. We allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 with a valuation of 76, but item 0 is already allocated. Their next highest valuation is for item 2 with 78, but it is also allocated. We allocate item 3 to Agent 2, which is their next highest valuation (50).
5. The remaining item is 1. We need to allocate it to one of the agents such that it causes the least envy. Agent 0 has the highest remaining interest in item 1 with a valuation of 72. Therefore, we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Finally, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (or none if not possible without increasing envy), we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived fairness based on the agents' valuations, given the constraints of integer allocation and no duplication of items. Note that while this allocation attempts to minimize envy, perfect envy-freeness might not be possible given the discrete nature of the items and valuations.
