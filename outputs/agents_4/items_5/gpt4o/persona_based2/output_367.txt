Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21   6  24  55  48
1  12  24  27  86  95
2   3  36  88  39   7
3  69  24  92   0  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 24 27 86 95]
 [ 3 36 88 39  7]
 [69 24 92  0 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that considers envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation, as much as possible. Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  21   6  24  55  48
1  12  24  27  86  95
2   3  36  88  39   7
3  69  24  92   0  97
```

Let's examine the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued item for agent 0 is item 3 (value 55). So, we assign item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued item for agent 1 is item 4 (value 95). Assign item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued item for agent 2 is item 2 (value 88). Assign item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued item for agent 3 is item 4 (value 97), but it's already taken. The next highest valued item is item 2 (value 92), but it's also taken. Item 0 is valued at 69 for agent 3, and it's not taken, so assign item 0 to agent 3.

5. **Unallocated Item**: Now, only item 1 is left unallocated. The highest valuation for item 1 is by agent 2 (value 36), but agent 2 already received their highest valued item. We can assign item 1 to agent 1, as they value it at 24, the next highest valuation among the remaining options for this item.

After the allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 4, 1
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
