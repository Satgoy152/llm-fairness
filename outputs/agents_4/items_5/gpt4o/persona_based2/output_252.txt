Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  31  14  99  64
1  10  99   0  10   9
2   2  63  68   4  20
3  78  81  23  31  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 99  0 10  9]
 [ 2 63 68  4 20]
 [78 81 23 31 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy among agents. The goal is to assign each item to an agent such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. A common approach to achieve this is by employing the Envy-Free algorithm or similar methods.

Given the valuations matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  31  14  99  64
1  10  99   0  10   9
2   2  63  68   4  20
3  78  81  23  31  17
```

We will proceed with an allocation strategy by analyzing the highest valuations each agent has for the items and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

### Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (99).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (99).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (68).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 1 (81), but since Agent 1 has a stronger claim, we can consider item 0 (78) or item 3 (31).

Items can be allocated as follows:
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Assign the remaining item, item 4, to Agent 0, as they have the second highest valuation for it (64).

### Resulting Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and it attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on highest individual valuations. Note that some agents may still have envy, but this is a balanced distribution given the constraints.
