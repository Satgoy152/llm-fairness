Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  73  89  96  87
1  86   8   6  11  92
2  44  20  63  23   7
3  85  99  52   9  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation and ensure envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations of the agents for each item. One common approach is to use the method of "maximizing the minimum utility" for each agent. Here, we will try to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item and the overall allocation minimizes envy among agents.

Firstly, let's list out the items each agent values the most, and then proceed to allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (96).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (92).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most (63).
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most (99).

By allocating each agent their highest valued item, we initially have:
- Agent 0 gets item 3
- Agent 1 gets item 4
- Agent 2 gets item 2
- Agent 3 gets item 1

Now, we have one item left to allocate: item 0.

To allocate item 0, we examine the remaining utilities for each agent:
- Agent 0 values item 0 at 3.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 86.
- Agent 2 values item 0 at 44.
- Agent 3 values item 0 at 85.

Given these values, item 0 should be allocated to Agent 1, who values it the most among the remaining choices.

Thus, the final allocation is:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4, 0]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and is based on maximizing individual valuations and reducing envy.

The JSON representation of the allocations is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
