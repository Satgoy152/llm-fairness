Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  46  46   1  15
1  51  34  27  66  51
2  98  60  17  63   5
3  17   5  21  55  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 4 agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. Our goal is to allocate all 5 items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free" method, where we aim to minimize any possible envy among the agents. In this context, envy means an agent values another agent's allocation more than their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 1, and 2 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest, but also values item 4.

A possible fair allocation based on these observations could be:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the highest (98).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (66).
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3, as they value it more than other items and it's their second-highest value (33).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it fairly high (46) and it is not among the highest valued by other agents.
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as well, since Agent 0 values it (46) and it complements their allocation without causing envy from others.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, minimizing envy and ensuring each agent feels they are receiving a fair share. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
