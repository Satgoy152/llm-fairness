Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  31  22  58  76
1   9  59  30   2  17
2  72  27  64  34  37
3  33  15  54  97  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. There are several methods to approach this problem, but one straightforward method for small instances like this is to use a greedy approach that tries to minimize envy.

Let's analyze the situation by considering each agent's valuation of all items:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** [27, 31, 22, 58, 76]
- **Agent 1's valuations:** [9, 59, 30, 2, 17]
- **Agent 2's valuations:** [72, 27, 64, 34, 37]
- **Agent 3's valuations:** [33, 15, 54, 97, 84]

We want to allocate these 5 items such that no agent envies another based on their own valuations.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Item 4** (highest overall value, 97 by Agent 3): Allocate to Agent 3.
2. **Item 0** (second highest overall value, 72 by Agent 2): Allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 3** (97 by Agent 3 but second highest for Agent 3 is already taken): Allocate to Agent 3.
4. **Item 1** (59 by Agent 1): Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 2** (64 by Agent 2 but Agent 2 already has one item): Allocate to Agent 3, who values it at 54.

**Allocations:**

- Agent 0 gets no items since their highest valuations are lower compared to other's preferences.
- Agent 1 gets item 1, which they value highest.
- Agent 2 gets item 0, their highest valuation.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 4, both highly valued by them, and item 2 as an additional allocation since Agent 0 had all lower preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they personally value highly, minimizing envy within the constraints given.
