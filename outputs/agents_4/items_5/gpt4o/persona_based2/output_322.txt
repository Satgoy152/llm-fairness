Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94   3  78   2  40
1  63  62  70  29  73
2  54  41  89  99  28
3  33  13  99  22  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem using fair division principles, we aim to allocate items to agents such that it minimizes envy and provides each agent with a fair share of the total value. One common approach is the "Envy-Free" criterion, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

We must ensure:
1. Each agent receives an integer number of items.
2. All 5 items are allocated.
3. The allocation should be as fair as possible in terms of perceived value by each agent.

Let's explore a possible allocation:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [94, 3, 78, 2, 40]
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 (value 94).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [63, 62, 70, 29, 73]
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 (value 73).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [54, 41, 89, 99, 28]
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is item 3 (value 99).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [33, 13, 99, 22, 73]
   - Highest value for Agent 3 is item 2 (value 99).

After allocating items based on each agent's highest values, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 2

Now, we have allocated 4 items. The remaining item is:

- **Item 1**: 
  - Values: [3, 62, 41, 13]

Given the remaining item, we should allocate it to the agent who values it most without causing significant imbalance. Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 62.

### Final Allocation:
The allocations are:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [4, 1]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item, and we have distributed all 5 items.

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```
