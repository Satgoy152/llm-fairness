Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  77  26  39  81
1  15  12  36  89  70
2  77  66  31  55  75
3  96  82   9  68   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that aims for fairness and envy-freeness, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Since there are 4 agents and 5 items, each agent should receive at least one item, and one agent will receive two.

To achieve a fair division, we can use a strategy where each agent gets at least their most valued item. Let's analyze the highest valuations each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 81.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 89.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 77.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 96.

Given these preferences, a direct allocation based on the highest individual valuations can be challenging since both Agent 2 and Agent 3 value item 0 the highest. Therefore, we need to adjust the allocation by considering second highest preferences as well:

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 3**, as they have the highest valuation for any item.
2. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1**, as this is their highest valued item.
3. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 0**, this is their highest valued item.
4. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 2**, as a compromise since item 0 is taken, and they have a decent valuation for item 2.

Now, we have one item left to allocate, which is item 1. We need to choose from the remaining agents (0, 1, 2, and 3) for this item. Looking at their valuations for item 1:

- Agent 0 values it at 77.
- Agent 1 values it at 12.
- Agent 2 values it at 66.
- Agent 3 values it at 82.

Agent 3 already has item 0, so allocating item 1 to them could create an imbalance. Instead, we should allocate item 1 to Agent 0, who values it the second highest and has space for another item.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives item 0.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' valuations and provide a fair division of items.
