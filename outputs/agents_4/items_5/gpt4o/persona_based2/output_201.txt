Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  25   7  46  29
1  86  81  63   9  98
2   3   8  95  82  86
3  36  59   3  85  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 25  7 46 29]
 [86 81 63  9 98]
 [ 3  8 95 82 86]
 [36 59  3 85 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means that after the allocation, no agent should prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle, based on their respective valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [99, 25, 7, 46, 29]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [86, 81, 63, 9, 98]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [3, 8, 95, 82, 86]
- Agent 3 values the items as: [36, 59, 3, 85, 11]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the maximin solution concept, which involves maximizing the minimum utility an agent can guarantee for themselves. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation for item 0.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation for item 4.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it has the highest valuation for item 2.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it has the highest valuation for item 3.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it has the second highest valuation for item 1 after Agent 0 who already has item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is envy-free based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
