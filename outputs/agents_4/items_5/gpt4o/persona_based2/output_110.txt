Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  40  45  57  59
1  77  41  24  70  34
2  54  46  94  72  61
3  19  81  32  10  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 41 24 70 34]
 [54 46 94 72 61]
 [19 81 32 10 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item" criterion, which sometimes offers a practical solution when perfect envy-freeness cannot be achieved.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [30, 40, 45, 57, 59]
Agent 1: [77, 41, 24, 70, 34]
Agent 2: [54, 46, 94, 72, 61]
Agent 3: [19, 81, 32, 10, 71]
```

We can try to allocate based on maximizing each agent's total value from their allocation, while trying to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation more than one item.

Here's a feasible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 77)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 81)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 94)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 57)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 59)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4 (total value 116)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (total value 77)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (total value 94)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (total value 81)

This configuration ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
