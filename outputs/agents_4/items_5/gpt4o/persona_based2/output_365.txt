Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58   2  77  91  90
1  15  32  68  95  44
2  99  87  42  44  12
3  39  63  94   8  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 32 68 95 44]
 [99 87 42 44 12]
 [39 63 94  8 73]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuation. Given the table of valuations, let's proceed with a methodical approach to allocate items:

### Valuation Table
```
Agent \ Item |  0   1   2   3   4
-------------|-------------------
0            | 58   2  77  91  90
1            | 15  32  68  95  44
2            | 99  87  42  44  12
3            | 39  63  94   8  73
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (99). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (91). Assign item 3 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 4 (90). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 2 (94). Assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 (87), but since agent 2 already has item 0, and since agent 1 values item 1 at 32 and has no items yet, it's fair to assign item 1 to agent 1 for balance.

Now, let's ensure the allocation is fair and sum up valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 4], Valuation = 91 + 90 = 181
- **Agent 1**: Items [1], Valuation = 32
- **Agent 2**: Items [0], Valuation = 99
- **Agent 3**: Items [2], Valuation = 94

Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```
