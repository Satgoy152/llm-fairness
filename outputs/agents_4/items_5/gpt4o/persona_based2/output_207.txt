Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  86  85  47  59
1  31  34  52  27  19
2  56  14  74   8  52
3   4  84  49  61  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 4 84 49 61 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent feels that their share is fair based on their valuations. One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their own valuation while keeping the allocation balanced.

The agents and their valuations for each item are given in the matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4  (Items)
0  48  86  85  47  59
1  31  34  52  27  19
2  56  14  74   8  52
3   4  84  49  61  19
```

We will try to allocate the items in a way that optimizes the valuations for each agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items 1 and 2 highly. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the most. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the most. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have one item left, item 4, which we will allocate to the agent who values their current allocation least or has no allocation, to balance the distribution:

- Agent 0: Has item 1 valued at 86.
- Agent 1: Has item 2 valued at 52.
- Agent 2: Has item 0 valued at 56.
- Agent 3: Has item 3 valued at 61.

Agent 1 has the lowest valuation of their current allocation (52), so we will give item 4 to Agent 1, who values it at 19, increasing their total valuation without exceeding others significantly.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
