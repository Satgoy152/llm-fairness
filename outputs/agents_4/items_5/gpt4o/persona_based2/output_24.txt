Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  95  67  73   9
1   3  97  69  60  51
2  23  29  72  39  41
3  12   2  26  37  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [12  2 26 37 56]]
Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we can use an approach that minimizes the maximum envy between any two agents. A common method for this is to use a max-min algorithm or similar heuristic to ensure the allocations are as balanced as possible given the constraints.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most: 95
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most: 97
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most: 72
   - Agent 3 values item 4 the most: 56

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Item 1 should be allocated to Agent 1 since they have the highest valuation for it.
   - Item 2 should be allocated to Agent 2 since they have the highest valuation for it.
   - Item 4 should be allocated to Agent 3 since they have the highest valuation for it.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Agent 0, having not yet received an item, should get their next most valued item. The highest remaining valuation for Agent 0 is item 3 (73).
   - The remaining item, item 0, can be allocated to Agent 3 as they have the next highest valuation for it (12) after their highest (56 for item 4).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5, matching the number of items available. This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives an item they highly value.
