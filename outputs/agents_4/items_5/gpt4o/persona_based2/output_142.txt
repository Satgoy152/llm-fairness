Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61   9  37  85  33
1  72   7  18  45  40
2  94   1  70  51  70
3  84  32   1  37  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 32  1 37 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of minimizing envy by ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while considering the overall fairness. In this scenario, we have four agents and five items. Our goal is to allocate these items in a way that reduces envy and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's begin by examining the valuations of each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [61, 9, 37, 85, 33]
- Agent 1: [72, 7, 18, 45, 40]
- Agent 2: [94, 1, 70, 51, 70]
- Agent 3: [84, 32, 1, 37, 33]

We will assign items to agents by choosing the highest available valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible and trying to minimize envy.

1. **Assign item 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 70. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Assign item 0**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 94. However, since Agent 2 already has item 2, we consider the next highest valuation. Agent 3 values item 0 at 84. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
3. **Assign item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 85. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
4. **Assign item 4**: Agent 2 also values item 4 highly at 70. Since Agent 2 already has an item, we move to the next highest. Agent 1 values item 4 at 40. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Assign item 1**: Finally, Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 32. Since Agent 3 already has item 0, Agent 0 values item 1 at 9, but Agent 0 has item 3. Hence, item 1 can be assigned to Agent 3, who still has a higher valuation than Agent 0.

After completing these assignments, we have allocated all items and ensured that each agent received at least one item, where possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
