Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  76  40  78  12
1  55  85  64  49  11
2  32  13  45  23  46
3  47  20  60  52   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 85 64 49 11]
 [32 13 45 23 46]
 [47 20 60 52  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or at least minimize envy among agents. Here, I'll provide a fair allocation based on the valuations given:

The valuations matrix is:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  76  40  78  12
1  55  85  64  49  11
2  32  13  45  23  46
3  47  20  60  52   1
```

First, let's consider the highest valued items per agent:

- Agent 0: Highest value is for item 3 (78)
- Agent 1: Highest value is for item 1 (85)
- Agent 2: Highest value is for item 4 (46)
- Agent 3: Highest value is for item 2 (60)

Now, try to assign these items to the respective agents:

- Assign item 3 to agent 0
- Assign item 1 to agent 1
- Assign item 4 to agent 2
- Assign item 2 to agent 3

We have allocated 4 items, and one item (item 0) is left:

Now, let's check the remaining valuations for item 0:

- Agent 0: 58
- Agent 1: 55
- Agent 2: 32
- Agent 3: 47

The highest valuation for item 0 is by agent 0. Thus, assign item 0 to agent 0.

The final allocations are:

- Agent 0: items 0, 3
- Agent 1: item 1
- Agent 2: item 4
- Agent 3: item 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
