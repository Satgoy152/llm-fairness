Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  59  21  90  68
1  63  48  77  89  33
2  69   1  85  72  87
3  81  15  24  18  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy as much as possible given that each agent must receive an integer number of items. Considering the valuations provided, we can aim for fairness by trying to balance total valuations across agents.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve the best possible allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuation Items**: Determine which items have particularly high valuations and which agents value them highly. We will try to allocate these items to the agents who value them the most to minimize envy.

2. **Distribute Items to Maximize Total Value**: Try to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total possible value.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Since there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent must receive two items. The allocation should ensure that the agent receiving two items is not envious of others.

Considering the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly (90).
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly (89).
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly (87).
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly (81).

Let's attempt an allocation based on these observations to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures:

- Agent 0 receives item 3, which they value at 90.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, which they value at 77.
- Agent 2 receives item 4, which they value at 87.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 1, which they value at 81 and 15 respectively, maximizing their total valuation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation should fairly distribute the items according to the valuations provided, attempting to minimize envy among agents.
