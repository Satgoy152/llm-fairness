Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  37  52  15  92  90
1  63  21  92  41  90
2  15  32  99   4  36
3  88  27  52  41   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and balances the total value each agent receives. One common approach to achieve fairness is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze and allocate the items to the agents:

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 88. Allocating item 0 to agent 3.

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 52. Allocating item 1 to agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 99. Allocating item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Items 3 and 4**:  
   - Both items 3 and 4 are valued equally by agents 0 and 1 at 92 and 90 respectively. In this situation, we can consider the overall balance of the allocation or any remaining high-value preferences.
   - Agent 1 has not received any items yet, so to balance the allocations and considering the equal high valuations, allocate items 3 and 4 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is balanced based on their highest-valued items.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
