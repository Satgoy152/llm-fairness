Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  93  47  42  96
1  25  96  30  18   6
2  36  90  85  55  18
3   8  78  28   7  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 90 85 55 18]
 [ 8 78 28  7 92]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the constraints, an approach that considers maximizing the minimum satisfaction or balancing the total valuation might be appropriate.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Valuations Matrix:
    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  93  47  42  96
1  25  96  30  18   6
2  36  90  85  55  18
3   8  78  28   7  92
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the following approach:

1. **Allocate the highest valued items to agents who value them the most.**
2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.**

Let's proceed with this approach:

- **Item 4**: Highest value for Agent 0 (96), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Highest value for Agent 1 (96), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Highest value for Agent 2 (85), so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Highest value for Agent 2 (55), but Agent 3 also values it similarly. However, to ensure envy-freeness and a more balanced allocation considering remaining items, assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- **Item 0**: Highest value for Agent 0 (54), but this agent already has item 4. To balance allocations and avoid envy, assign item 0 to Agent 3.

After these assignments, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
