Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  92  20  79   8
1  36  62  95  45  92
2  30  18  82   2  91
3  13  82  79  37  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations, one way to approach this is to calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and try to distribute the items such that each agent maximizes their own valuation based on their preferences.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 82 + 92 + 20 + 79 + 8 = 281
- Agent 1: 36 + 62 + 95 + 45 + 92 = 330
- Agent 2: 30 + 18 + 82 + 2 + 91 = 223
- Agent 3: 13 + 82 + 79 + 37 + 57 = 268

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Item 0: Highest value by Agent 0 (82), allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (92), allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (95), allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Highest value by Agent 0 (79), allocate to Agent 0. However, Agent 0 cannot take all items. Re-evaluate:
   - Second highest value by Agent 3 (37), allocate to Agent 3.
5. Item 4: Highest value by Agent 1 (92), allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure each agent has at least one item and the distribution is balanced:

- Agent 0 has items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 has items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 has no item, so we need to re-allocate.
- Agent 3 has item 3.

Rebalance to ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- Re-allocate item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 had second highest valuation for item 1).

The final allocation after rebalancing:

- Agent 0: item 0
- Agent 1: item 2, item 4
- Agent 2: item 1
- Agent 3: item 3

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and attempts to maximize their valuation based on preferences.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
