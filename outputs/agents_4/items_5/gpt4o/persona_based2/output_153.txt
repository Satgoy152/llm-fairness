Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  48  55  57  43
1  63  85  76  45  85
2  53  41  50  97  71
3  93  32  58  38   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the fair division problem with the goal of achieving envy-freeness, we can consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction relative to their valuations, while ensuring no agent is envious of another's allocation.

Given the following valuations:

```
Agent 0: [65, 48, 55, 57, 43]
Agent 1: [63, 85, 76, 45, 85]
Agent 2: [53, 41, 50, 97, 71]
Agent 3: [93, 32, 58, 38, 5]
```

Let's allocate each of the 5 items to the agents:

1. **Agent 0**: We try to give them items with high personal valuation while considering others' valuations as well. Item 0 (valuation 65) is a good choice, as it is also not the highest valued by any other agent.
   
2. **Agent 1**: Item 1 (valuation 85) should be allocated to Agent 1 since it's their highest valued item and it ensures they don't envy others for that item.

3. **Agent 2**: Item 3 (valuation 97) is the highest valued item for Agent 2; giving them this item will maximize their satisfaction and decrease envy potential.

4. **Agent 3**: Item 0 is already allocated, so we look at Item 2 (valuation 58) for Agent 3, as it provides a good balance.

Now, we have not yet allocated Item 4. We observe that Agent 1 highly values Item 4 (valuation 85) and Agent 0 can be satisfied with their current allocation. So we allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 as well, since Agent 1 has a valuation of 85 for both Item 1 and Item 4, making them indifferent between the two.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is done in a way that minimizes envy among agents given their respective valuations.
