Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  40   1  37  92
1  54  66  38  53  90
2  45  68  94  49  39
3  40  77  88  60  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both efficiency (maximizing total value) and fairness (e.g., envy-freeness). However, given that envy-freeness might not be completely achievable in every scenario, we will aim to distribute items in a way that attempts to minimize envy and maximize each agent's valuation.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to find an allocation where each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 5.

### Valuations Table

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 2  | 40 | 1  | 37 | 92 |
| 1          | 54 | 66 | 38 | 53 | 90 |
| 2          | 45 | 68 | 94 | 49 | 39 |
| 3          | 40 | 77 | 88 | 60 | 89 |

### Strategy for Allocation

1. **Agent 0:** Has the highest valuation for item 4. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** After excluding item 4, the highest remaining value is for item 1. Assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** The highest value for agent 2 is item 2. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** The highest value for agent 3 is item 3. Assign item 3 to agent 3.

Now, we have assigned 4 items. We have remaining items and agents with no allocations yet.

5. **Remaining Item:** Item 0.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 among remaining agents. Assign item 0 to agent 1.

### Final Allocation

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and attempts to maximize each agent's valuation based on their preferences.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation is complete and ensures all items are allocated to the agents.
