Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  89  52  29  96
1  92  71  89  27  33
2  57  96  55  26  64
3  60  15  24  56  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 96 55 26 64]
 [60 15 24 56 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. Envy-freeness is a desirable property in fair division, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

The valuations for the agents are as follows:

- Agent 0: [61, 89, 52, 29, 96]
- Agent 1: [92, 71, 89, 27, 33]
- Agent 2: [57, 96, 55, 26, 64]
- Agent 3: [60, 15, 24, 56, 84]

To achieve a fair allocation, let's analyze the highest valuations and distribute items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (96) and item 1 (89). 
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 (92) and item 2 (89) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 (96) and item 4 (64) highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 (84) and item 3 (56) highly.

A potential fair allocation could be:

- Give **Agent 0** item 4, as it is their highest valued item.
- Give **Agent 1** item 0, since it is their highest valued item.
- Give **Agent 2** item 1, as it is their highest valued item.
- Give **Agent 3** item 3, which they value the most after item 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item 2:

- **Agent 1** values item 2 at 89, which is also a high valuation.

Thus, a fair allocation of the items can be:

- **Agent 0**: [4]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 2]
- **Agent 2**: [1]
- **Agent 3**: [3]

This allocation attempts to consider each agent's preferences and distribute items in a way that respects their highest valuations as much as possible. Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
