Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  49  60  87  63
1  37  58  79  96  26
2   2  24   7   2  66
3   6  47  37  14  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where no agent envies another based on their own valuations. Given the valuations, we need to carefully assign items to minimize envy and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to finding a fair allocation:

1. **List the valuations for each item by each agent:**

   - Item 0: (Agent 0: 6, Agent 1: 37, Agent 2: 2, Agent 3: 6)
   - Item 1: (Agent 0: 49, Agent 1: 58, Agent 2: 24, Agent 3: 47)
   - Item 2: (Agent 0: 60, Agent 1: 79, Agent 2: 7, Agent 3: 37)
   - Item 3: (Agent 0: 87, Agent 1: 96, Agent 2: 2, Agent 3: 14)
   - Item 4: (Agent 0: 63, Agent 1: 26, Agent 2: 66, Agent 3: 76)

2. **Assign each item to the agent that values it the most without creating envy:**

   - **Item 0**: Agent 1 (value 37 is the highest)
   - **Item 1**: Agent 1 (value 58 is the highest)
   - **Item 2**: Agent 1 (value 79 is the highest)
   - **Item 3**: Agent 0 (value 87 is the highest)
   - **Item 4**: Agent 3 (value 76 is the highest)

3. **Review and adjust allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item (if possible), and the total is 5 items:**

   - Since Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items 0, 1, and 2, we assign these items to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 as they have the highest valuation for it.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 as they have the highest valuation for it.
   - Agent 2 does not receive any items because their highest valuation (66 for Item 4) is still lower than Agent 3's valuation for the same item.

4. **Final Allocation**:

   - Agent 0: Item 3
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2
   - Agent 2: No items
   - Agent 3: Item 4

This allocation ensures each item goes to the agent who values it the most, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4]
}
```
