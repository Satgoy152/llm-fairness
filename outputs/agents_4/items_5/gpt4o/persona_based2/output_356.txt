Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  96  35  92   7
1   8   8  10  62  73
2  77  82  32  17  73
3  12  89  66  65  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to finding an envy-free allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: \(56 + 96 + 35 + 92 + 7 = 286\)
   - Agent 1: \(8 + 8 + 10 + 62 + 73 = 161\)
   - Agent 2: \(77 + 82 + 32 + 17 + 73 = 281\)
   - Agent 3: \(12 + 89 + 66 + 65 + 78 = 310\)

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Each item should ideally go to the agent who values it the most. This helps in reducing envy.

3. **Item Assignments Based on Maximum Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (77) > Agent 0 (56) > Agent 3 (12) > Agent 1 (8)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (96) > Agent 2 (82) > Agent 3 (89) > Agent 1 (8)
   - Item 2: Agent 3 (66) > Agent 0 (35) > Agent 2 (32) > Agent 1 (10)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (92) > Agent 1 (62) > Agent 3 (65) > Agent 2 (17)
   - Item 4: Agent 3 (78) > Agent 2 (73) = Agent 1 (73) > Agent 0 (7)

4. **Ensure Fair Distribution:**
   - Balance the allocation so that each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will end up with two items.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
   - Agent 1: Item [4]
   - Agent 2: Item [0]
   - Agent 3: Item [2]

This allocation ensures that each item is given to an agent who highly values it, aiming to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```
