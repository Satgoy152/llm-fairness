Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  98  10  12   3
1  37  55  20  37  28
2  44  20  89   7  20
3   3   1  94  94  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 98 10 12  3]
 [37 55 20 37 28]
 [44 20 89  7 20]
 [ 3  1 94 94 10]]
Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the five items to the four agents in a way that tries to achieve fairness, particularly focusing on the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent to their own. 

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  98  10  12   3
1  37  55  20  37  28
2  44  20  89   7  20
3   3   1  94  94  10
```

The goal is to assign each of the items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to one of the agents 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Here's an approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Item 0** is highly valued by agent 0, so we allocate **item 0 to agent 0**.
2. **Item 1** is also highly valued by agent 0, but it's optimal for fairness to allocate it to **agent 0** since they value it highest.
3. **Item 2** is highly valued by agent 2, so we allocate **item 2 to agent 2**.
4. **Item 3** is equally highly valued by agent 3, we allocate **item 3 to agent 3**.
5. **Item 4** does not have very high values but is valued more by agent 1 compared to other agents, so we allocate **item 4 to agent 1**.

This allocation attempts to maximize individual satisfaction and keep envy to a minimum by giving each agent at least one item they value relatively highly.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
