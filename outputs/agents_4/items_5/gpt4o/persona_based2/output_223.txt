Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  15  30  72  72
1  49  10  78  55   1
2  73  95  65  76  55
3   7  96  31  29  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 9 15 30 72 72]
 [49 10 78 55  1]
 [73 95 65 76 55]
 [ 7 96 31 29 49]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation, based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [9, 15, 30, 72, 72]
- Agent 1: [49, 10, 78, 55, 1]
- Agent 2: [73, 95, 65, 76, 55]
- Agent 3: [7, 96, 31, 29, 49]

We need to consider the total value each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the value each agent perceives in their allocation while minimizing envy.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 2 highly values item 1 (95) and item 3 (76).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (78).
   - Agent 0 highly values items 3 and 4 (both 72).
   - Agent 3 highly values item 1 (96).

2. **Initial Assignments:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value 95).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value 78).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value 72).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value 7, but low for others).

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 4 is left. Agent 0 values it highly at 72.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 two items, but they are low value for others.

### Final Allocation:

This allocation tries to distribute items such that agents receive items they value highly compared to others, minimizing potential envy:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4, both valued at 72 by them.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, valued at 78 by them.
- Agent 2 receives item 1, valued at 95 by them.
- Agent 3 receives item 0, which they value more than others. 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item that is among the most valued by them while trying to keep the distribution fair.
