Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  25  75  80  20
1  61  28  67  63  62
2  67  37  63  66  16
3  18  61  40  89  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to determine their preferences.
2. Try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Total Value |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 0     | 62     | 25     | 75     | 80     | 20     | 262         |
| 1     | 61     | 28     | 67     | 63     | 62     | 281         |
| 2     | 67     | 37     | 63     | 66     | 16     | 249         |
| 3     | 18     | 61     | 40     | 89     | 70     | 278         |

A potential allocation strategy:

- Assign each agent their most valued item among the available options, ensuring that no agent is envious of another's allocation.

Allocations:
- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (80).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (67).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (67).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (70).

After assigning the most valued items:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 4

Remaining item 1 can be assigned to Agent 3 as they have a relatively high valuation for it (61), minimizing overall envy.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 1, 4

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
