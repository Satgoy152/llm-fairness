Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  37  40   2   5
1  36  80  57  40  34
2  49  48   0  92  13
3  45  74  46   6   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82 37 40  2  5]
 [36 80 57 40 34]
 [49 48  0 92 13]
 [45 74 46  6  8]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we'll aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent given their valuations. This is a classic problem in fair division. One common approach is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar methods; however, given the constraints (integer items per agent), we will use a heuristic approach to allocate the items fairly.

First, let's summarize the problem using the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [82, 37, 40, 2, 5]
- Agent 1 values: [36, 80, 57, 40, 34]
- Agent 2 values: [49, 48, 0, 92, 13]
- Agent 3 values: [45, 74, 46, 6, 8]

Our goal is to allocate these 5 items to 4 agents. We will try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by giving each an item they value highly, while ensuring no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 0**: Valued highest by Agent 0 (82). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (80). Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (57). However, Agent 3 values it 46, which is almost as high as their highest value for Item 1 (74). To avoid envy, allocate to Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (92). Allocate to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (34), but Agent 2 values it 13, which is better than their next highest after Item 3. Allocate to Agent 2.

### Resulting Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1.
- Agent 2 gets Items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 gets Item 2.

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives, respecting their preferences and minimizing envy.

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets an integer number of items according to their preferences.
