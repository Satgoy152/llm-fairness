Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  14  68  98  77
1  69  19  96  53  77
2  91  30  55  25  72
3  33  45  17  28  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can utilize a fair division algorithm. One such algorithm is the "Greedy Allocation" algorithm, where items are allocated one by one to the agent who values the next unallocated item the most. This approach helps ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, thereby reducing potential envy.

Let's examine the table and make allocations:

1. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 98. So, allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 96. So, allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 91. So, allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 next highest at 77. So, allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values item 1 the most at 45. So, allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.
