Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  76  83  50  11
1  38  11  79  61  99
2  37  36   0  37  62
3  35  20  55  55  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation. However, since the problem involves integer allocations, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible, but we can aim for a fair distribution.

We have four agents and five items, and the goal is to allocate all five items. The valuations of each agent for each item are given, so we'll try to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 2 the most, with a valuation of 83.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 4 the most, with a valuation of 99.
3. **Agent 2**: Has relatively low valuations, but among the highest, item 4 is valued at 62.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 4 the most, with a valuation of 78.

Considering these preferences and aiming to distribute the items fairly, letâ€™s make the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Will be allocated item 2, which is their highest-valued item.
- **Agent 1**: Will be allocated item 4, which is their highest-valued item.
- **Agent 2**: Will be allocated item 0, which is their highest remaining valued item.
- **Agent 3**: Will be allocated item 3, which is their highest remaining valued item.

Now, we have one item left, item 1. To allocate this item, we observe the remaining preferences:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 at 76.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 at 11.
- **Agent 2** values item 1 at 36.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 at 20.

Given that Agent 0 values item 1 the highest among the remaining preferences, we'll allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the agents' highest preferences and fairly distributes the five items among the four agents.
