Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  75  46  83  70
1  35  33  68  78  95
2  14  49  94  24  25
3  17  13  95  62  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy by considering the valuations of each agent for the items. A common approach in fair division is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, where no agent should envy another agent's allocation after possibly removing one item from the envied agent's allocation.

The valuations matrix is given as follows:

```
Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4
-----------|----|----|----|----|----
0          | 77 | 75 | 46 | 83 | 70
1          | 35 | 33 | 68 | 78 | 95
2          | 14 | 49 | 94 | 24 | 25
3          | 17 | 13 | 95 | 62 | 48
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a simple heuristic such as the "maximum marginal utility" approach, where each agent picks the item that gives them the highest value relative to what they have already received, one by one, until all items are allocated. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest value for item 3 (83). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest value for item 4 (95). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest value for item 2 (94). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest value for item 2, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 3, also taken. Item 0 (17) is next highest among remaining items. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, only item 1 is left unallocated. Let's allocate it to the agent who values it the most and has the least total value so far:

- Agent 0 has item 3 (value 83).
- Agent 1 has item 4 (value 95).
- Agent 2 has item 2 (value 94).
- Agent 3 has item 0 (value 17).

Item 1 has a value of 75 for Agent 0, 33 for Agent 1, 49 for Agent 2, and 13 for Agent 3. The highest value for item 1 among those who haven't received high-value items is Agent 2 (49). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Final allocations:

- **Agent 0**: [3]
- **Agent 1**: [4]
- **Agent 2**: [2, 1]
- **Agent 3**: [0]

These allocations are made to ensure that agents receive items they value highly while adhering to the EF1 criterion.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [0]
}
```
