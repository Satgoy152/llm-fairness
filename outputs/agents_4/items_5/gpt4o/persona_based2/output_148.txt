Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24   4  26  90  45
1   3  38   1  85  18
2   8  75  27   6  56
3  72  57  71  49   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent receives items such that they value their allocation as highly as possible compared to other allocations. This is a challenging task and perfect envy-freeness is often hard to achieve. However, we can strive for a reasonable balance.

We'll examine each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (90), followed by item 2 (26).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (85), followed by item 1 (38).
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (75), followed by item 4 (56).
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most (72), followed by item 2 (71).

Considering these preferences, let's try to allocate items:

- **Item 3** is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 1. Allocating it to Agent 1, who has a high valuation for it and fewer high-value options, could improve fairness.
- **Item 0** is best allocated to Agent 3 since they value it the most.
- **Item 2** is highly valued by Agent 0 and Agent 3. To minimize envy, we allocate it to Agent 3.
- **Item 1** should go to Agent 2, who values it highly.
- **Item 4** can be allocated to Agent 0, providing them with another item they value moderately.

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while considering their preferences. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and we distribute all 5 items among the agents.
