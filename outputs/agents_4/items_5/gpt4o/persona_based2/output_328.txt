Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73   5  35   4  92
1  83  57  56   9   4
2   4  83  93  31  33
3  88  73  36  83  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73  5 35  4 92]
 [83 57 56  9  4]
 [ 4 83 93 31 33]
 [88 73 36 83 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations that each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [73, 5, 35, 4, 92]
Agent 1: [83, 57, 56, 9, 4]
Agent 2: [4, 83, 93, 31, 33]
Agent 3: [88, 73, 36, 83, 79]
```

We will attempt to allocate the items such that the total value for each agent is as high as possible given their preferences:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (83), followed by Agent 3 (88). However, Agent 3 values other items highly as well, so Agent 1 should receive it to balance allocations.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (83). Assign it to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (93). Assign it to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (83). Assign it to Agent 3.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (92). Assign it to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, aiming for an envy-free result as much as possible. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the total value they receive based on their preferences.
