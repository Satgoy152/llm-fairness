Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  90  53  70  66
1  32  19  54  10  43
2  77  38  81  72  69
3  70  47  82  70  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 90 53 70 66]
 [32 19 54 10 43]
 [77 38 81 72 69]
 [70 47 82 70 17]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for a solution that is Pareto efficient and tries to minimize envy. One common method used in fair division is the "Envy-free up to one good" (EF1) criterion, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent after removing at most one item from the other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [72, 90, 53, 70, 66]
Agent 1: [32, 19, 54, 10, 43]
Agent 2: [77, 38, 81, 72, 69]
Agent 3: [70, 47, 82, 70, 17]
```

We will assess the allocation by considering the highest value items for each agent first and then balancing the allocation to minimize envy or maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 1 (value 90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 2 (value 54).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 2 (value 81), but since item 2 is allocated to Agent 1, next is item 0 (value 77).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 2 (value 82), but since item 2 is allocated to Agent 1, next is item 0 (value 70), but since item 0 is allocated to Agent 2, next is item 3 (value 70).

Considering the above and adjusting to ensure all items are allocated:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 4 to the agent who values it the most without causing excessive envy. Agent 0 values item 4 at 66, which doesn't cause excessive envy.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share considering their preferences, and all items are allocated.
