Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  51  44  93  97
1  85  57  34  68  93
2  50  51  94  15  95
3  43  35  91  76  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among agents, we want to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes each agent's satisfaction. 

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent**: Each agent should ideally receive items that they value highly to minimize envy.

2. **Consider the values**: We need to ensure that the allocation is such that each agent feels they have a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's take a look at the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  51  44  93  97
1  85  57  34  68  93
2  50  51  94  15  95
3  43  35  91  76  96
```

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest (97), followed by item 3 (93).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the highest (85), followed by item 4 (93).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the highest (94), followed by item 4 (95).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 4 the highest (96), followed by item 2 (91).

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 (highest unique value for Agent 1).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 (second highest value for Agent 3).

This leaves us with one item unallocated (item 1). We need to ensure that all items are allocated.

5. **Assign item 1**: This item can go to Agent 0, who values it relatively higher than other unallocated items.

Now, each agent has been allocated an integer number of items, and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing potential envy and maximizing fairness in distribution.
