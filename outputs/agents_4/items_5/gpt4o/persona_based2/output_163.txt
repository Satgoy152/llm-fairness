Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  14   3  63  58
1  54  22  37  83  61
2  89  47  70  82  62
3   9  87  23  76  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can utilize a round-robin or a similar method that considers the preferences of each agent. Given the valuations, I'll attempt to allocate the items such that each agent has a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's analyze the problem:

The valuation matrix is as follows:

```
Agent \ Item |  0   1   2   3   4
---------------------------------
       0     | 55  14   3  63  58
       1     | 54  22  37  83  61
       2     | 89  47  70  82  62
       3     |  9  87  23  76  21
```

Aiming for a fair allocation, we should consider high-value items for each agent while ensuring equitable distribution. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1: Agent 1 values item 3 the most among their valuations (83).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2: Agent 2 values item 0 the most (89).
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3: Agent 3 values item 1 the most (87).
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0: Agent 0 values item 4 highly (58) after item 3.
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2: This item has the highest remaining value for Agent 2 (70) compared to other agents.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, which should help with perceived fairness.

Now, let's format this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation assigns all items and considers each agent's valuations to the best extent possible with integer item allocations.
