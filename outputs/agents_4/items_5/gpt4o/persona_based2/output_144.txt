Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  69  62  36  82
1  66  24   5  91  75
2  97  83  56   0  72
3  67  76  54  53  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Here is a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: Each agent's preference for items based on the given table:
   - Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 4 (82).
   - Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 3 (91).
   - Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 0 (97).
   - Agent 3's highest valuation is for item 1 (76).

2. **Initial allocation**: Allocate each agent their highest valued item if possible:
   - Agent 0 receives item 4.
   - Agent 1 receives item 3.
   - Agent 2 receives item 0.
   - Agent 3 receives item 1.

3. **Evaluate remaining items**: Item 2 remains unallocated.

4. **Allocate remaining items**: Since item 2 is left, we look for the agent with the lowest total valuation from their allocated items and give them item 2:
   - Agent 0: value 82 (for item 4)
   - Agent 1: value 91 (for item 3)
   - Agent 2: value 97 (for item 0)
   - Agent 3: value 76 (for item 1)

   Agent 3 has the lowest total valuation, so they will receive the remaining item 2.

5. **Final allocation**: 
   - Agent 0 receives item 4.
   - Agent 1 receives item 3.
   - Agent 2 receives item 0.
   - Agent 3 receives items 1 and 2.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
