Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  25  85  88  84
1  10  66  15  73  28
2  48  99  25  71  20
3   5  49  11  56  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their respective valuations. We will aim to either minimize envy or distribute the items as fairly as possible so every agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 0 (87), 2 (85), and 3 (88).
- Agent 1 values item 1 (66) and 3 (73) relatively high.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (99).
- Agent 3 has moderate valuations but not the highest for any item.

One potential allocation strategy is to assign items based on the highest unique valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item they value highly.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation (99).
2. **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 1, as they place a high value on it (73).
3. **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation among their choices (87).
4. **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest valuation (85).
5. **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 3, as it provides a fair allocation, ensuring they receive an item.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation attempts to maximize the value received by each agent based on their preferences.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation reflects the agents' preferences as closely as possible, while keeping the distribution fair.
