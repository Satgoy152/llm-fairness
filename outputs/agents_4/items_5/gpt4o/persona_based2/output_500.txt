Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  17  59   1  18
1  36  27  98  54  77
2  59  58  32   6  59
3  89  95   1  15  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 27 98 54 77]
 [59 58 32  6 59]
 [89 95  1 15 28]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels that their own allocation is at least as good as the allocation received by any other agent, using their own valuation.

The table of valuations is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 71     | 17     | 59     | 1      | 18     |
| 1     | 36     | 27     | 98     | 54     | 77     |
| 2     | 59     | 58     | 32     | 6      | 59     |
| 3     | 89     | 95     | 1      | 15     | 28     |

To find an envy-free allocation, we'll consider assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's examine each item:

- Item 0: Valuations are 71, 36, 59, and 89. Agent 3 values it the most.
- Item 1: Valuations are 17, 27, 58, and 95. Agent 3 values it the most.
- Item 2: Valuations are 59, 98, 32, and 1. Agent 1 values it the most.
- Item 3: Valuations are 1, 54, 6, and 15. Agent 1 values it the most.
- Item 4: Valuations are 18, 77, 59, and 28. Agent 1 values it the most.

Assigning items based on the highest valuation:

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 receives no items.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, which helps in achieving envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
