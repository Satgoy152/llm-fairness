Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  45  85  82  70
1  59  29  30  42  70
2  77  86  27  84  32
3  38  72  62  74  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[59 45 85 82 70]
 [59 29 30 42 70]
 [77 86 27 84 32]
 [38 72 62 74 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent's allocation is envy-free as much as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [59, 45, 85, 82, 70]
Agent 1: [59, 29, 30, 42, 70]
Agent 2: [77, 86, 27, 84, 32]
Agent 3: [38, 72, 62, 74, 87]
```

We'll try to assign items such that each agent's perceived value is maximized while minimizing envy. Let's consider the following allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (85) and item 3 (82).
2. **Agent 1** should be given item 4 (70) as it is their highest valued item.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 (86) and item 3 (84) the most.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 (87) the highest.

We can make the following allocation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

This allocation considers the highest valuations while aiming for fairness. Hereâ€™s how the allocation looks:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that have relatively high value to them, attempting to reduce envy across allocations.
