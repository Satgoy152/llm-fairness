Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  63  65  84  21
1  88  90  79  87  98
2  22   7  95  95  30
3  58  70  54  90  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents in a way that aims to achieve fairness, ideally minimizing envy among the agents. A common approach for such problems is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum value received by each agent, known as the max-min fairness, or to ensure envy-freeness if possible.

Letâ€™s evaluate the situation:

- Agent 0 values: [83, 63, 65, 84, 21]
- Agent 1 values: [88, 90, 79, 87, 98]
- Agent 2 values: [22, 7, 95, 95, 30]
- Agent 3 values: [58, 70, 54, 90, 94]

To achieve a fair allocation, we will try to allocate items such that each agent receives the highest possible value given the constraints, attempting to minimize the maximum envy.

Here's an allocation that balances the valuations:

1. **Agent 1:** This agent highly values items 1 and 4. Assign these items to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2:** This agent highly values items 2 and 3. Assign these items to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0:** Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by them.
4. **Agent 3:** This agent will not receive any items in this allocation.

Now, let's verify that all items are allocated:

- Items assigned: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] (all items)
- Agents with items: 0, 1, 2
- Agent without items: 3

Agent 3 does not receive any items, which is a limitation of having fewer items than agents, but the allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": []
}
```
