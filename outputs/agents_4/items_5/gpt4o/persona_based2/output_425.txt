Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2   3  77  90  37
1  45  35  89  54  39
2  32  88  25  45  56
3  90  33  73  25  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [90 33 73 25 25]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and distribute items in a manner that approximates an envy-free allocation as closely as possible.

1. **Agent Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [2, 3, 77, 90, 37]
   - Agent 1: [45, 35, 89, 54, 39]
   - Agent 2: [32, 88, 25, 45, 56]
   - Agent 3: [90, 33, 73, 25, 25]

2. **Strategy for Fair Allocation:**
   - Each agent should receive items that they value relatively higher to minimize envy.
   - Consider giving at least one highly valued item to each agent if possible.
   - Ensure that the total number of items allocated equals 5.

3. **Proposed Allocation:**
   - **Agent 0**: Prefers items 3 and 2, with values 90 and 77.
   - **Agent 1**: Prefers item 2, with a value of 89.
   - **Agent 2**: Prefers item 1, with a value of 88.
   - **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0, with a value of 90.

Given these preferences and the need for each agent to get at least one item, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 3 (90).
- Agent 1 receives item 2 (89).
- Agent 2 receives item 1 (88).
- Agent 3 receives item 0 (90).
- The remaining item, 4, can be assigned to Agent 0, as it is their next highest preference.

4. **Final Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation minimizes envy by ensuring each agent receives at least one of their highly valued items, and all items are allocated.
