Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  61  20  92  97
1  71  70  97  23  26
2  66  85  50  43  21
3   1  38  26   4  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents according to their valuations, we aim to minimize envyâ€”where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. This is a challenging task, especially given discrete allocations, but we can attempt a reasonable distribution.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [56, 61, 20, 92, 97]
Agent 1: [71, 70, 97, 23, 26]
Agent 2: [66, 85, 50, 43, 21]
Agent 3: [ 1, 38, 26,  4, 36]
```

One possible way to allocate the items is to attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction for the items they receive, thereby minimizing potential envy:

1. **Agent 0** seems to value item 4 the highest, so let's allocate this item to them.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest, so we allocate this item to them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest, so we allocate this item to them.
4. **Agent 3** has generally low valuations, but item 3 seems reasonable. We allocate this item to them.
5. Finally, item 0 can be considered for Agent 1, who values it second highest after item 2.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

- **Agent 0** gets item 4.
- **Agent 1** gets items 0 and 2.
- **Agent 2** gets item 1.
- **Agent 3** gets item 3.

By this allocation, we ensure each agent has at least one item, and we approximate a fair distribution based on their valuations. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
