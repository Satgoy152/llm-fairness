Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  45  78  16  89
1  37  19  11  77  27
2  11  84  74  79  89
3  94  20  26  86  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, although achieving complete envy-freeness for indivisible items might not be possible. We'll attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation based on their valuations.

**Valuations Table:**

- Agent 0: [77, 45, 78, 16, 89]
- Agent 1: [37, 19, 11, 77, 27]
- Agent 2: [11, 84, 74, 79, 89]
- Agent 3: [94, 20, 26, 86, 19]

**Approach:**

1. Prioritize the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Attempt to minimize envy by balancing high-value allocations across different agents.

**Allocation Steps:**

- **Agent 0**: Highly values item 4 (89) and item 2 (78). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 3 (77) the most. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 (89) equally with Agent 0 but since we have already allocated item 4, we allocate item 1 (84) to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 0 (94) the highest. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have items 2 and 4 unallocated. Since Agent 0 already has item 4, we will consider allocating item 2 to an agent who has received less value so far.

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 because they also highly value item 2.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of highly valued items while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.
