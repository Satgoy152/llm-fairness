Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  99  73  51  84
1  91  89  30  25   9
2  59  95  56  16  42
3  42  60  77  23  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to balance the valuations each agent has for the items they receive, while also ensuring that envy is minimized. One common approach to this problem is the "Envy-Free Allocation" method, where each agent should feel that they received at least as much value as any other agent's allocation.

Let's consider the valuations from the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 20     | 99     | 73     | 51     | 84     |
| 1     | 91     | 89     | 30     | 25     | 9      |
| 2     | 59     | 95     | 56     | 16     | 42     |
| 3     | 42     | 60     | 77     | 23     | 14     |

The goal is to allocate the 5 items to the 4 agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible.

1. **Agent 0** highly values Item 1 (99) and Item 4 (84).
2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 0 (91) and Item 1 (89).
3. **Agent 2** highly values Item 1 (95) and Item 2 (56).
4. **Agent 3** highly values Item 2 (77) and Item 1 (60).

To distribute these items fairly, let's try the following allocation:

- **Agent 0** should receive Item 1. This gives them the highest valued item from their perspective.
- **Agent 1** should receive Item 0. This is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 2** should receive Item 2. This gives them a high value item.
- **Agent 3** should receive Item 3. This is not their highest value, but it provides balance.
- **Agent 0** can also receive Item 4. This balances out their allocation with another high-value item.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 5 items among the 4 agents while considering high-value preferences for each agent, and attempts to minimize envy among them.
