Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  87  90  41  96
1  80   0  69  28  80
2  27  38   2  14  36
3  76  30   7  78  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an allocation that reflects their preferences as closely as possible. We will use the concept of envy-freeness as a guide, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, given their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** seems to highly value items 1, 2, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** values items 0 and 4 the most.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively low and even valuations, but values item 1 the most.
4. **Agent 3** values items 0 and 3 the most.

Considering these preferences, we'll aim to distribute the items to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0** will get item 4 (highest value item for them).
- **Agent 1** will get item 0 (highest value item for them).
- **Agent 2** will get item 1 (highest value item for them).
- **Agent 3** will get item 3 (highest value item for them).

This allocation leaves item 2, which we need to distribute. Since Agent 0 values item 2 equally to item 1, and Agent 1 values item 2 more than Agent 3, we should assign item 2 to Agent 0 to maximize overall satisfaction.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to optimize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations, aiming for a fair and envy-free distribution.
