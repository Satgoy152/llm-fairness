Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58   0  10  48  69
1   8   8  77  66  89
2  47  83  76  89  19
3  14  92   4  42  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents, we should aim for an allocation that ensures envy-freeness, where no agent prefers someone else's allocation more than their own. Given the valuations table, we will allocate items in such a way that each agent receives items that maximize their value while respecting the integer constraint of item distribution.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Analyze Valuations:** First, examine the valuations of each item by each agent. We will try to assign items such that the overall satisfaction is maximized.

2. **Initial Assignment:** Assign items based on the highest valuation to ensure that each agent receives their most valued item if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Make adjustments if necessary to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's analyze and decide on the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are item 4 (69), item 0 (58), and item 3 (48). 
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are item 4 (89), item 2 (77), and item 3 (66).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are item 3 (89), item 1 (83), and item 2 (76).
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are item 1 (92), item 4 (66), and item 3 (42).

Allocations based on the highest valuations:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (valuation of 89, highest overall).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (valuation of 89, next highest).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (valuation of 92, next highest).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (valuation of 58, highest available for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (valuation of 77, highest remaining).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.
- Agent 3 receives item 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, minimizing envy among agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
