Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  56  63  65  71
1  34  86  42  37  48
2  88  79  78  60  96
3  61  13  99  90  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[64 56 63 65 71]
 [34 86 42 37 48]
 [88 79 78 60 96]
 [61 13 99 90 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One common method to achieve this is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or using a round-robin approach based on valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [64, 56, 63, 65, 71]
Agent 1: [34, 86, 42, 37, 48]
Agent 2: [88, 79, 78, 60, 96]
Agent 3: [61, 13, 99, 90, 18]
```

Let's evaluate a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 at 96, which is the highest single valuation across all agents. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 at 99. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

3. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 at 86. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

4. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 at 65. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

5. The remaining item 0 can be assigned to **Agent 0** as they value it quite highly at 64.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, reducing the potential for envy.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items that they have high valuations for, aiming to create a fair division.
