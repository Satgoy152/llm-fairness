Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  41  73  11  90
1  22   0  10  26  10
2  43  29  47  11   8
3  29   4  91  81  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that maximizes overall satisfaction while attempting to minimize envy among agents. A common approach in such scenarios is to look for envy-free or Pareto-efficient allocations. Given the valuations, let's proceed with the allocation process.

### Step 1: Analyze the Valuations
1. **Agent 0** values items highly with notable emphasis on item 4.
2. **Agent 1** has very low valuations overall, valuing item 3 relatively higher than others.
3. **Agent 2** has moderate valuations, with item 2 being the highest.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the highest, followed by items 4 and 3.

### Step 2: Allocate Items Based on Valuations
To achieve a fair allocation:
- **Assign item 4 to Agent 0**: This item has the highest value for Agent 0, and no other agent values it as highly.
- **Assign item 3 to Agent 1**: This is the highest valued item for Agent 1, providing some utility given their low valuations.
- **Assign item 2 to Agent 3**: Agent 3 values this item the highest, which helps reduce their potential envy.
- **Assign item 0 to Agent 2**: This item has a moderate value for Agent 2, and Agent 0 already has the highly valued item 4.
- **Assign item 1 to Agent 0**: Given that Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 1, this allocation maximizes their utility without significantly affecting the others.

### Step 3: Check for Completeness
Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent is assigned an integer number of items. In this case, all 5 items are distributed, and each agent has at least one item, except for Agent 1, who gets only item 3.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations, giving each agent items that they value relatively highly while minimizing envy.
