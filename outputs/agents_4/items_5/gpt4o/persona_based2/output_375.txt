Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13   2  20  89  34
1  67  55  80   8  11
2  82   8  47  86  13
3  14  16  97  33  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [14 16 97 33 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that maximizes the minimum satisfaction for each agent or ensures envy-freeness to the extent possible. Given the valuations, let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 3 (value 89)
   - Next highest is Item 4, but agent 0 already gets a high-valued item.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (value 80)
   - Next highest is Item 0, but agent 1 already gets a high-valued item.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (value 82)
   - Next highest is Item 3, but we already assigned it to agent 0.
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (value 97) is taken by agent 1.
   - Next highest available: Item 4 (value 72).

Considering the above, we can finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 3.
- Agent 1 gets Item 2.
- Agent 2 gets Item 0.
- Agent 3 gets Item 4.
- Remaining item, Item 1, can be allocated to agent 0, as it increases their total value without causing envy.

The final allocation in JSON format is:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
