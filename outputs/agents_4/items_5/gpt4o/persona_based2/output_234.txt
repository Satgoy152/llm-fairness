Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  68  27  22  37
1  32  39  21  31  33
2   8  82  27  14  85
3  93  62  40   8  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 68 27 22 37]
 [32 39 21 31 33]
 [ 8 82 27 14 85]
 [93 62 40  8 85]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations from the table, we need to allocate the 5 items in a way that is as fair as possible.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 78 | 68 | 27 | 22 | 37 |
| 1            | 32 | 39 | 21 | 31 | 33 |
| 2            | 8  | 82 | 27 | 14 | 85 |
| 3            | 93 | 62 | 40 | 8  | 85 |

We will allocate the items considering each agent's preferences:

1. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (93), making it an ideal allocation to reduce potential envy.
2. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (85), which makes it a clear choice for them.
3. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (68), so we allocate this item to them.
4. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (31), so we allocate this item to them.
5. The remaining item (item 2) can be allocated to Agent 0 as they also value it (27) and it maximizes their overall satisfaction.

This allocation avoids envy as much as possible given the constraints and ensures each agent receives at least one item, except for Agent 2 who receives only one but their highest valued item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
