Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  54  91  67  55
1  37  75  47  36  98
2  55  50  84  60  49
3  66  78  92  62  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 54 91 67 55]
 [37 75 47 36 98]
 [55 50 84 60 49]
 [66 78 92 62 62]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering the valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. This implies that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other allocation given the other agents' allocations.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 2 (valued at 91). Allocating item 2 to agent 0 would maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the most (valued at 98). Allocating item 4 to agent 1 would maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a relatively high valuation for item 0 (valued at 55) compared to other items. Allocating item 0 to agent 2 would be beneficial.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 1 (valued at 78) and item 3 (valued at 62) relatively well compared to other agents. Allocating items 1 and 3 to agent 3 would be a good choice.

The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 1 and 3

This results in a total allocation of all 5 items, with each agent receiving items that maximize their respective valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
