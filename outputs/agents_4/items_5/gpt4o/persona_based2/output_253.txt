Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  61  15  83  19
1  15  15  75  70  30
2  29  93  10  94  79
3  66  56  76  36   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to allocate all 5 items in a way that considers the agents' preferences.

Here's a step-by-step approach to finding an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 with a valuation of 83. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 with a valuation of 75. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 3 with a valuation of 94, but it's already allocated. The next highest value is item 1 with a valuation of 93. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 2 with a valuation of 76, but it's already allocated. The next highest value is item 0 with a valuation of 66. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

5. Now, only item 4 is left unallocated. We must assign it to one of the agents. Agent 2 values item 4 at 79, which is the highest unallocated value among all agents for item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Following this strategy, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]
- Agent 3: [0]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
