Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  21   9  81  41
1  78  50  12  10  27
2  13  43  72  31   9
3  76  85  15  32  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the four agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to equalize the perceived value each agent receives. However, as we have integer constraints and only five items to allocate, it may not be possible to achieve complete envy-freeness. Nonetheless, we can strive for a reasonable distribution based on the given valuations.

Let's analyze the table and attempt to allocate items:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  21   9  81  41
1  78  50  12  10  27
2  13  43  72  31   9
3  76  85  15  32  13
```

1. Start with items that have clear high valuations for specific agents:
   - Item 0 has the highest value for agent 1 (78).
   - Item 1 has the highest value for agent 3 (85).
   - Item 2 has the highest value for agent 2 (72).
   - Item 3 has the highest value for agent 0 (81).

2. Allocate these items based on the highest valuation to minimize initial envy:
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 3.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

3. One item remains (item 4). Consider the valuations for this item:
   - Agent 0: 41
   - Agent 1: 27
   - Agent 2: 9
   - Agent 3: 13

   Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (41).

4. Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 1

The json format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation seeks to distribute the items in a way that respects the highest individual valuations, attempting to reduce envy as much as possible within these constraints.
