Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  20  28  78  24
1  76  23  10  91  84
2  31  47  91  98  37
3  86  75  70  56  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer to have the allocation of another agent given their own valuation of the items.

Let's calculate each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0: 60 + 20 + 28 + 78 + 24 = 210
- Agent 1: 76 + 23 + 10 + 91 + 84 = 284
- Agent 2: 31 + 47 + 91 + 98 + 37 = 304
- Agent 3: 86 + 75 + 70 + 56 + 18 = 305

Given these valuations, we will try to allocate items to maximize each agent's valuation of their own bundle, while trying to keep the allocation envy-free.

Let's examine the highest-valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (78).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (91).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (98).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (86).

Given this, let's start by allocating:
- Item 3 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for this item.
- Item 0 to Agent 3, as they have the highest valuation for this item.

Now, we'll allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 1 values item 4 highly (84), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (28), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- The last item 1 can be given to Agent 3, as they have a relatively high valuation for it compared to other remaining options.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [0, 1]

Now, let's present this in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some value, and we attempt to respect the highest individual valuations for the available items, while maintaining an integer allocation for all items.
