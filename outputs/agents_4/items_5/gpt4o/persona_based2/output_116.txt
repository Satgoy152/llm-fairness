Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  42  47  74  23
1  15  25  90  73  33
2  34  37  13  39  66
3  81  42  57  28  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [81 42 57 28 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate all items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a complex problem, but we can attempt to find a balanced allocation.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [5, 42, 47, 74, 23]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [15, 25, 90, 73, 33]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [34, 37, 13, 39, 66]
- Agent 3 values items as follows: [81, 42, 57, 28, 41]

We will try to allocate the items such that each agent receives at least one high-value item according to their own valuation, while considering the others' preferences.

### Initial Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 3 (74). Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2 (90). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 4 (66). Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 0 (81). Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now we have the following items allocated:
- Item 3 to Agent 0
- Item 2 to Agent 1
- Item 4 to Agent 2
- Item 0 to Agent 3

We have 1 item left to allocate, which is item 1.

### Final Allocation:

5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their second highest valued remaining item (42), which is reasonably high for them.

Now let's look at the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 1]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: Item [0]

This allocation considers the highest valued items for each agent and ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value.

### Final JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
