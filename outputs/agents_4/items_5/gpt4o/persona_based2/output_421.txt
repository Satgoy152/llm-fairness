Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  62   0  36  90
1   0   2  64   7  78
2  45  55  45  95  71
3  24  53  71  88  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0  2 64  7 78]
 [45 55 45 95 71]
 [24 53 71 88 10]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for a distribution that is envy-free or as close to it as possible, given the preferences of the agents. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuation matrix for each agent:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [81, 62, 0, 36, 90]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [0, 2, 64, 7, 78]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [45, 55, 45, 95, 71]
- Agent 3 values items as follows: [24, 53, 71, 88, 10]

We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and agent envy is minimized.

Given these valuations, let's make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest at 90, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the highest at 64, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the highest at 95, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the highest at 53, so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, with item 0 remaining. Let's allocate item 0 to the agent who values it the most and hasn't received their highest-valued item yet.

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest among the remaining options, so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 0]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and we try to minimize envy to the extent possible.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
