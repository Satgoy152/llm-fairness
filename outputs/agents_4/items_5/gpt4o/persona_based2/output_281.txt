Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  68  64  69  49
1  57  42  12  74  29
2  77  33  44  86  41
3  27  74   3  37  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents while aiming for a fair division, we can consider methods like maximizing the minimum utility (maximin) or achieving envy-freeness. Given the valuations, we want to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, ideally without envying another agent's allocation.

One approach to achieve this is to use an envy-free algorithm, such as the adjusted winner procedure or the maximum Nash welfare method. However, since we're dealing with discrete items and integer allocations, it might not be possible to achieve perfect envy-freeness or an exact equal division. Instead, we try to approximate fairness as closely as possible.

Let's examine the valuations and consider a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (76) and item 3 reasonably high (69).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (74).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (86).
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (74).

Based on this, we can attempt to allocate items with the aim of satisfying high valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (high valuation: 76).
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (highest valuation: 86).
- Assign item 1 to agent 3 (highest valuation: 74).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1, as it's the next highest available valuation (29).
- Assign item 2 to agent 0, as it gives them a reasonably high total valuation and ensures they get two items.

Here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1]

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations and reduces potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
