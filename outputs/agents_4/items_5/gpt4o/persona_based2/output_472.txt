Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  96   1  80  45
1   7   3  84  86  72
2  30  67   6  89  58
3   5  92  28  44  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that tries to reduce envy among the agents as much as possible. A common approach to find such an allocation is to use the "envy-free" criterion, where no agent should prefer another agent's bundle over their own.

Let's use the given valuations to try to find an envy-free or near envy-free allocation:

**Valuations:**
- Agent 0: [86, 96, 1, 80, 45]
- Agent 1: [7, 3, 84, 86, 72]
- Agent 2: [30, 67, 6, 89, 58]
- Agent 3: [5, 92, 28, 44, 86]

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3.
   - Agent 3 highly values items 1 and 4.

2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (96).
   - This allocation reduces potential envy towards Agent 3, who also values item 1 highly.

3. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (89).
   - This allocation reduces potential envy towards Agents 0 and 1, who also value item 3.

4. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 values item 4 the most (86).
   - This allocation minimizes envy as it is the highest valued item for Agent 3.

5. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0:**
   - Given Agent 0's high valuation of item 0 (86), this helps maintain fairness.

6. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (84).

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [4]

This allocation attempts to minimize envy based on the valuations provided.

**JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, considering the potential for envy.
