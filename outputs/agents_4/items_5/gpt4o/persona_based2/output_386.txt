Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  68  21  71  65
1  34   6  94  52  66
2  36  93  54  47  42
3  55   6  58  81   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 93 54 47 42]
 [55  6 58 81  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution where no agent feels envious of another. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other bundle assigned to another agent. Here, we will try to balance the total value each agent derives from their assigned items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [91, 68, 21, 71, 65]
- Agent 1 values: [34, 6, 94, 52, 66]
- Agent 2 values: [36, 93, 54, 47, 42]
- Agent 3 values: [55, 6, 58, 81, 3]

First, calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 91 + 68 + 21 + 71 + 65 = 316
- Agent 1: 34 + 6 + 94 + 52 + 66 = 252
- Agent 2: 36 + 93 + 54 + 47 + 42 = 272
- Agent 3: 55 + 6 + 58 + 81 + 3 = 203

Next, let's allocate the items in a way that attempts to balance these valuations and minimize envy. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 0 (value 91) and item 4 (value 65). Total value: 156
2. Agent 1 receives item 2 (value 94). Total value: 94
3. Agent 2 receives item 1 (value 93). Total value: 93
4. Agent 3 receives item 3 (value 81). Total value: 81

Each agent's allocation is the best possible based on the highest individual item value they can achieve from the unallocated items.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims for fairness by distributing the items such that each agent receives a bundle they highly value, minimizing potential envy among the agents.
