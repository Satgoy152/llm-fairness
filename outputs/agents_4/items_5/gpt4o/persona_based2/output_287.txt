Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  23   9  40  27
1  16  93  72  63  49
2  91  60  84  21  36
3  87  49  92  79  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 23  9 40 27]
 [16 93 72 63 49]
 [91 60 84 21 36]
 [87 49 92 79 81]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that seeks to minimize envy among agents and is as fair as possible given the valuations. This involves considering the preferences and values that each agent assigns to the items, and then distributing the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction and minimizes envy.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [81, 23, 9, 40, 27]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [16, 93, 72, 63, 49]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [91, 60, 84, 21, 36]
- Agent 3 values the items as: [87, 49, 92, 79, 81]

To find a fair allocation, we can use a method such as the "maximum weighted matching" in a bipartite graph, where agents and items are nodes and edges are weighted by the agents' valuations. However, for simplicity and given the constraints of the problem, let's proceed with a heuristic approach that provides a reasonable allocation.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is by Agent 2 (91), allocate to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (93), allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (92), allocate to Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (79), allocate to Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (81), allocate to Agent 3.

### Resulting Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets no items, as their highest valuation is 81 (item 0), which has already been allocated to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets items 2, 3, and 4.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation sum and minimizes potential envy, as each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
