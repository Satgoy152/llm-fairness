Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64   2  62  14  29
1   1  95   2  23  94
2  45  55  74  10  38
3  26  79  80  61  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[64  2 62 14 29]
 [ 1 95  2 23 94]
 [45 55 74 10 38]
 [26 79 80 61 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the valuations provided. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

Let's analyze the given table of valuations:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4
0  64   2  62  14  29
1   1  95   2  23  94
2  45  55  74  10  38
3  26  79  80  61  80
```

One possible approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuations while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. We'll allocate items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highest, with a value of 64.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highest, with a value of 95.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highest, with a value of 74.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highest, with a value of 61.

After assigning these items, the only item left is item 4. To minimize envy, allocate item 4 to the agent who values it highest among the remaining agents:

- Agent 0 values item 4 at 29.
- Agent 1 values item 4 at 94.
- Agent 2 values item 4 at 38.
- Agent 3 values item 4 at 80.

Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 94. However, since Agent 1 already received item 1, we will assign item 4 to the next highest bidder who hasn't received multiple items, which is Agent 3.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 4.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
