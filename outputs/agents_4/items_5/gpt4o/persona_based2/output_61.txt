Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  68  37  50  76
1  10  91  82  71  54
2  48  65  50  80  87
3  47   0   4  37  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [47  0  4 37 61]]
Output:
To allocate the items such that each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is as fair as possible, we can aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuation of the items. We will attempt to allocate items such that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent to their own allocation.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for Item 0 (98) and Item 4 (76).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for Item 1 (91) and Item 2 (82).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for Item 3 (80) and Item 4 (87).
4. **Agent 3** has low valuations compared to others, but Item 4 (61) is most valuable to them.

We need to ensure each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 5.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate Item 0 (value 98) to Agent 0 as it maximizes their utility.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate Item 1 (value 91) to Agent 1, as it's the highest value for them.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate Item 3 (value 80) to Agent 2 since it's their highest remaining value.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate Item 4 (value 61) to Agent 3 since it's their highest value.
- **Remaining Items**: We have one item left, Item 2. It can go to Agent 1 to maximize their utility since it's their second-highest valuation (value 82).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation should minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints of the problem.
