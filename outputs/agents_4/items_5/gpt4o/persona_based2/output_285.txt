Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  75  22  50  77
1  37  84  20  70  64
2  22  73  76  87  71
3   3   4  74  65  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1 75 22 50 77]
 [37 84 20 70 64]
 [22 73 76 87 71]
 [ 3  4 74 65 87]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents in a way that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while considering the constraints.

Given the table of agent valuations:

|     | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1  | 75 | 22 | 50 | 77 |
| 1 | 37 | 84 | 20 | 70 | 64 |
| 2 | 22 | 73 | 76 | 87 | 71 |
| 3 | 3  | 4  | 74 | 65 | 87 |

We can attempt a simple allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents to maximize their individual valuations while ensuring the total number of items equals the number of items available.
2. Check for envy-freeness by ensuring no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (77).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (84).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (87).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (87), but it's already allocated, so the next highest is item 2 (74).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets one item, except for agent 3, who might not be completely satisfied due to item 4 being allocated to agent 0. We need to adjust to ensure all items are allocated.

After some adjustments and ensuring all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items [4]
- Agent 1: Items [1]
- Agent 2: Items [3]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 0] (since they have a relatively lower valuation, they receive two items to balance total valuations)

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents. Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation aims to be as envy-free as possible under the given constraints.
