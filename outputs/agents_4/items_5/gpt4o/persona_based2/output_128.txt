Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  13   7  19  95
1  19  70  82  74  69
2  75  68  21  54   3
3  21  22  13  75  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate items such that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Here is one way to approach this problem:

1. **Identify the highest preference for each item.** Allocate the item to the agent who values it the most. This approach may not fully achieve envy-freeness but can serve as a starting point to ensure that highly valued items go to those who appreciate them most.

2. **Check for adjustments.** After initial allocations, check if any agent has a significantly lower total valuation than others and adjust if necessary to increase fairness.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Valuations: Agent 0 (26), Agent 1 (19), Agent 2 (75), Agent 3 (21).
  - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

- **Item 1**: 
  - Valuations: Agent 0 (13), Agent 1 (70), Agent 2 (68), Agent 3 (22).
  - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

- **Item 2**: 
  - Valuations: Agent 0 (7), Agent 1 (82), Agent 2 (21), Agent 3 (13).
  - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

- **Item 3**: 
  - Valuations: Agent 0 (19), Agent 1 (74), Agent 2 (54), Agent 3 (75).
  - Allocate to Agent 3 (highest valuation).

- **Item 4**: 
  - Valuations: Agent 0 (95), Agent 1 (69), Agent 2 (3), Agent 3 (82).
  - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute items based on the highest individual valuations. Further adjustments can be made if needed to address specific fairness criteria beyond envy-freeness, such as maximizing total valuations per agent or ensuring equitable share of total value.
