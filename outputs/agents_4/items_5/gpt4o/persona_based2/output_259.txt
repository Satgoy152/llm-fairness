Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  22  66  69  67
1  97  30  18  15  58
2  12  58  94  22   0
3  61  40  99  94  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly, aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation for each item and try to maximize their satisfaction while ensuring that all items are distributed. A common approach is to use an algorithm that seeks to minimize envy among the agents.

Here is one possible allocation strategy using the given table of valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 2, 3, and 4. However, to minimize envy, we can give them item 0, which is also highly valued by them.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 the most, but since it's already allocated, we can allocate item 4, which is the next highest-valued item for this agent.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 2, which is the highest among all agents for this particular item. Therefore, it makes sense to allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 the highest, so we can allocate this item to them. Additionally, since item 1 has not been assigned yet and agent 3 values it substantially more than agent 2 does, we can assign item 1 to agent 3 as well.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation should aim to reduce potential envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This distribution allocates all 5 items among the 4 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, which should help in minimizing envy given the valuation matrix.
