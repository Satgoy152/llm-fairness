Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  48   9  68  24
1  90  60  41  22  15
2  31  57  47  58  81
3  87  11   5   5  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that strives for envy-freeness. Here, we will make sure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's first examine the valuations:

```
Valuation Matrix:
    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  48   9  68  24
1  90  60  41  22  15
2  31  57  47  58  81
3  87  11   5   5  74
```

A reasonable approach is to allocate items in such a way that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while minimizing potential envy from others.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 3 (68).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 0 (90).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 4 (81).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 0 is already taken, next highest is item 3 (74), but item 3 is taken, so we choose item 4 (74), which is also taken, so next highest is item 2 (5), which is not ideal. Re-evaluate strategy.

Instead, let's resolve these conflicts:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (48).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 0 (90).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4 (81).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 2 (5).

Since items 0, 1, 2, and 4 are allocated, item 3 remains unallocated. Let's check if we can assign it to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 1, and item 3 is valued at 68, which is high.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 0, values item 3 at 22.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 4, values item 3 at 58.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 2, values item 3 at 5.

Thus, the least envy-inducing assignment for item 3 is to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and we attempt to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
