Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  51  70  57  29
1  18  66   2   6  56
2  81   7  53  32  84
3  75  28  83  93  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels another agent has received a more valuable collection of items than they have, based on their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent Preference Analysis:**
   - Agent 0: Highest value is for item 0 (78).
   - Agent 1: Highest value is for item 1 (66).
   - Agent 2: Highest value is for item 4 (84).
   - Agent 3: Highest value is for item 3 (93).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Preferences:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - The remaining item is item 2.
   - The highest remaining value for item 2 is held by Agent 3 (83).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 0.
   - Agent 1 receives item 1.
   - Agent 2 receives item 4.
   - Agent 3 receives items 3 and 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest preferences, which helps in achieving an envy-free division where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```
