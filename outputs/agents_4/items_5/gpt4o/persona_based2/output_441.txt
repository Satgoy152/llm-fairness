Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  21  98  83  26
1  14  68  30  47  30
2  10  89   8  69  78
3  10  91  90  93  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to use a strategy that maximizes the minimum satisfaction among the agents or to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy.

Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 93     | 21     | 98     | 83     | 26     |
| 1     | 14     | 68     | 30     | 47     | 30     |
| 2     | 10     | 89     | 8      | 69     | 78     |
| 3     | 10     | 91     | 90     | 93     | 53     |

### Strategy:
1. **High Valuation Preference:** Assign items to the agent who values them the most, if possible.
2. **Avoid Envy:** Try to ensure that no agent feels significantly envious of another by having a very imbalanced allocation.

### Allocation Plan:
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most (93). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 3 values item 1 the most (91). Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the most (98). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the most (93). Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values item 4 the most (78). Assign to Agent 2.

### Resulting Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives no items.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.
- Agent 3 receives items 1 and 3.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each item to the agent who values it most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least some share of the total value. Note that Agent 1 receives no items, which could be a point of contention if the process allowed for negotiation or compensation.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
