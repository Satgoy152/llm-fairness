Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50   2  81  64  76
1  94  92  30  73   8
2  87  67  90  68  68
3  39  46   7  64  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39 46  7 64 14]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to find a distribution that minimizes envy among the agents. A common approach is to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here are the valuations for each agent for each item:

```
Agent 0: [50, 2, 81, 64, 76]
Agent 1: [94, 92, 30, 73, 8]
Agent 2: [87, 67, 90, 68, 68]
Agent 3: [39, 46, 7, 64, 14]
```

To achieve a fair distribution, let's try to allocate items such that the total value perceived by each agent is as equal as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuation for items 2 (81) and 4 (76). Assign item 2 to Agent 0 to maximize their perceived value.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 (94) and item 1 (92). Assign item 0 to Agent 1 to give them a high value.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 highly (90) but it is already assigned, so assign item 3 (68) and item 4 (68) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: With lower valuations, and remaining items being 1 and 3, assign item 1 (46) to Agent 3.

### Final Allocation

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [4, 3]
- Agent 3: [1]

This allocation attempts to balance the values received by each agent as best as possible under envy-freeness constraints.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This distribution ensures each agent has at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 5, which is the total number of items available.
