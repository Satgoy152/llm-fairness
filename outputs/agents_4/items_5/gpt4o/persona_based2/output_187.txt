Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  11  44  94  88
1  71  80  52  34  47
2  87   4  19  91  40
3  15  66  32  42  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 11 44 94 88]
 [71 80 52 34 47]
 [87  4 19 91 40]
 [15 66 32 42 40]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. To achieve this, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum share or attempting to make the allocation envy-free (if possible).

Let's start by considering each agent's total valuation for all items and aim to allocate items in a way that provides each agent with a fair share according to their valuations.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: 28, 11, 44, 94, 88
- Agent 1: 71, 80, 52, 34, 47
- Agent 2: 87, 4, 19, 91, 40
- Agent 3: 15, 66, 32, 42, 40

### Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 28 + 11 + 44 + 94 + 88 = 265
- Agent 1: 71 + 80 + 52 + 34 + 47 = 284
- Agent 2: 87 + 4 + 19 + 91 + 40 = 241
- Agent 3: 15 + 66 + 32 + 42 + 40 = 195

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most while ensuring the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.
2. Attempt to distribute high-value items to the agents who value them the most.

### Proposed Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 4 (94, 88) - Total Value: 182
- Agent 1: Item 1 (80) - Total Value: 80
- Agent 2: Item 0 (87) - Total Value: 87
- Agent 3: Item 2 (32) - Total Value: 32

This allocation attempts to satisfy each agent according to their preferences and ensures all items are distributed. Agent 0 receives two items they highly value, while agents 1, 2, and 3 receive one item each that they value relatively highly.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value, and the total allocation of items is equal to 5.
