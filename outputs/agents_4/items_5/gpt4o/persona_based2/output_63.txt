Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  76  68   9   9
1  66  24  38   8  20
2  76  75  50  28   4
3  83  66  14  90  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers someone else's allocation to their own. Given the valuations, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Valuations**: First, observe the valuations of each agent for each item.

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This often helps in minimizing envy as each agent gets the items they value highly.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If this initial allocation results in any agent not getting any items, or if it creates significant envy, adjust by swapping items between agents to minimize the maximum envy.

Let's execute this approach:

- **Item 0**: Valuations are [32, 66, 76, 83]. Assign to Agent 3, as they have the highest valuation.
- **Item 1**: Valuations are [76, 24, 75, 66]. Assign to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation.
- **Item 2**: Valuations are [68, 38, 50, 14]. Assign to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation.
- **Item 3**: Valuations are [9, 8, 28, 90]. Assign to Agent 3, as they have the highest valuation.
- **Item 4**: Valuations are [9, 20, 4, 19]. Assign to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation.

Now let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items [0, 3]

This initial allocation gives two agents 2 items each and one agent 1 item, while Agent 2 receives no items. To make the distribution more balanced and possibly reduce envy, let's consider reallocating:

Reallocation:
- Swap Item 3 from Agent 3 to Agent 2, who values it second highest after Agent 3.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [0]

Now, each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation attempts to respect the highest valuations where possible while ensuring no agent is left without an item.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
