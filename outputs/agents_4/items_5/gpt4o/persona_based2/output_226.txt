Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  73   5  49  41
1  58  26   3  89  51
2   1  15  72  70  46
3  28  99  65  94  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 26  3 89 51]
 [ 1 15 72 70 46]
 [28 99 65 94 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, which means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [2, 73, 5, 49, 41]
Agent 1: [58, 26, 3, 89, 51]
Agent 2: [1, 15, 72, 70, 46]
Agent 3: [28, 99, 65, 94, 26]
```

We need to allocate the items to agents considering these values. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's assign each item based on the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0: 2
   - Agent 1: 58
   - Agent 2: 1
   - Agent 3: 28
   - **Allocate to Agent 1 (58)**

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0: 73
   - Agent 1: 26
   - Agent 2: 15
   - Agent 3: 99
   - **Allocate to Agent 3 (99)**

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0: 5
   - Agent 1: 3
   - Agent 2: 72
   - Agent 3: 65
   - **Allocate to Agent 2 (72)**

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0: 49
   - Agent 1: 89
   - Agent 2: 70
   - Agent 3: 94
   - **Allocate to Agent 3 (94)**

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0: 41
   - Agent 1: 51
   - Agent 2: 46
   - Agent 3: 26
   - **Allocate to Agent 1 (51)**

Now, let's assign the items according to these allocations, ensuring each agent is represented in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation assigns the items to the agents who value them the most, attempting to achieve a fair and envy-free distribution.
