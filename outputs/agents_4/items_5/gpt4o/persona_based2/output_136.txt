Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  55  65  90  56
1  39  87  95  56  11
2  52   1  67  84  30
3  60  98  98  85  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[48 55 65 90 56]
 [39 87 95 56 11]
 [52  1 67 84 30]
 [60 98 98 85 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This approach helps in reaching a kind of envy-freeness where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
     0   1   2   3   4
0:  48  55  65  90  56
1:  39  87  95  56  11
2:  52   1  67  84  30
3:  60  98  98  85  31
```

### Possible Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 1 (value 98) is highly valued. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 as no other agent values it as highly as Agent 3 does.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2 (value 95) is highly valued. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it the most.

3. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 3 (value 90) is highly valued by Agent 0. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

4. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0 (value 52) is valued highest by Agent 2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4:**
   - This item is least valued across all agents, but we need to allocate it. Based on remaining preferences:
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, who values it at 56, which is relatively high for this item.

This allocation maximizes the minimum satisfaction for each agent based on their individual preferences.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuations while keeping the allocation as fair as possible.
