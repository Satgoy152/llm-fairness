Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  93  10  89   6
1  11  19  72  67  10
2  55  86  17  67  60
3   6  77  23  32  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To tackle this fair division problem, we should aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent more than their own.

First, let's look at the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 65     | 93     | 10     | 89     | 6      |
| 1     | 11     | 19     | 72     | 67     | 10     |
| 2     | 55     | 86     | 17     | 67     | 60     |
| 3     | 6      | 77     | 23     | 32     | 50     |

We need to assign each item to one of the agents in a way that tries to minimize envy.

One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation, or at least minimize envy, is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. So, let's go through each item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 65, which is the highest among all agents.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 93, which is again the highest.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 72, which is the highest.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 89, which is the highest.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it at 60, which is the highest.

Now, let's allocate these items based on the maximum value approach:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, and 3 (valuations: 65, 93, 89)
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (valuation: 72)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (valuation: 60)
- **Agent 3**: No items

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most. Let's put this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by prioritizing each agent's top-valued items.
