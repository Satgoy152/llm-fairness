Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  56  37  55  79
1  35  11  64  52   9
2  99  45  58   4   6
3  55  74  78  26  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, or at least minimize envy. Here's a possible approach to achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 94 + 56 + 37 + 55 + 79 = 321
   - Agent 1: 35 + 11 + 64 + 52 + 9 = 171
   - Agent 2: 99 + 45 + 58 + 4 + 6 = 212
   - Agent 3: 55 + 74 + 78 + 26 + 98 = 331

2. **Highest Valuation per Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (99)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (56)
   - Item 2: Agent 3 (78)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (55)
   - Item 4: Agent 3 (98)

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation:
     - Item 0 to Agent 2
     - Item 1 to Agent 0
     - Item 2 to Agent 3
     - Item 3 to Agent 0
     - Item 4 to Agent 3

4. **Adjustments for Fairness:**
   - Agent 0 has two items: 1, 3
   - Agent 3 has two items: 2, 4
   - Agent 2 has one item: 0
   - Agent 1 has no items.
   
   To ensure each agent gets a fair share, we can swap one item between agents:
   - Swap Item 1 (from Agent 0) with Item 0 (Agent 2) because Agent 2 values Item 1 fairly (45) and Agent 0 values Item 0 highly (94). This swap ensures Agent 1 gets an item next.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (as no swaps leave 1 unallocated, we need to reallocate)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 
   - Agent 3: Item 4

Given the adjustments, the final allocation can be made as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with some consideration to the agents' preferences while trying to minimize envy.
