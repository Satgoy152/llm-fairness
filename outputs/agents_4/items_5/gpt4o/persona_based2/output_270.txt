Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  27  73  80  55
1  96  28  42  64  62
2  57  20   0  47  15
3  35  72  49  92  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 28 42 64 62]
 [57 20  0 47 15]
 [35 72 49 92 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. This approach attempts to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as highly as possible given the constraints. Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

### Valuations Table
```
| Agent/Item |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|     0      | 58  | 27  | 73  | 80  | 55  |
|     1      | 96  | 28  | 42  | 64  | 62  |
|     2      | 57  | 20  |  0  | 47  | 15  |
|     3      | 35  | 72  | 49  | 92  | 53  |
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 highly (80).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the most (96).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most (57); however, item 0 is better suited for Agent 1 given their higher valuation.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 and 1 highly, but after assigning item 3 to Agent 0, item 1 is the next best option (72).

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (value: 80).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 (value: 96).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (value: 15), as other higher priority items have been allocated.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 1 (value: 72) and item 2 (value: 49).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the individual preferences of the agents based on the given constraints.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide a fair distribution while considering the individual valuations of the items by each agent.
