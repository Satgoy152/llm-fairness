Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  11  66  20  41
1  26  49  49   0  31
2  69  10  69  26  84
3  84  94  31  34  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 49 49  0 31]
 [69 10 69 26 84]
 [84 94 31 34 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total satisfaction and minimizing envy among agents. One common approach is to use the "envy-free" allocation principle, which ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

First, let's consider the valuations table:

```
   0   1   2   3   4
0  30  11  66  20  41
1  26  49  49   0  31
2  69  10  69  26  84
3  84  94  31  34  23
```

We want to allocate each item to one agent such that the overall distribution is as fair as possible. We'll use a heuristic approach to minimize envy and maximize total valuation by considering each agent's highest-valued items.

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most with a value of 66.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most with a value of 49.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most with a value of 84.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most with a value of 94, but since item 1 has the highest valuation by Agent 1, we consider the next highest value for Agent 3, which is item 0 with a value of 84.

Now, let's allocate these items:
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

This leaves us with item 3, which needs to be allocated next based on the highest remaining valuations:
- Agent 2 values item 3 next highest with a valuation of 26.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 4 and 3
- Agent 3: Item 0

Finally, the allocations can be presented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraint of integer allocations and the valuations provided.
