Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93   9  65  21  67
1   3  67  81  73  31
2  43  14  12  45  30
3  72  69  17  76  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for an envy-free distribution if possible. However, given that each agent receives an integer number of items and there are only five items, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible. We'll aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible under these constraints.

Let's start by examining the valuation matrix and find a suitable allocation:

```
Valuation Matrix:
    0   1   2   3   4
0  93   9  65  21  67
1   3  67  81  73  31
2  43  14  12  45  30
3  72  69  17  76  37
```

One approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. **Assign Item 0:** Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (93). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Assign Item 1:** Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (67). Assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Assign Item 2:** Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (81). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
4. **Assign Item 3:** Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (76). Assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Assign Item 4:** Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (67). Assign item 4 to agent 0.

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent given their preferences:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 4].
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 2].
- Agent 2 gets no items.
- Agent 3 gets item [3].

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint of distributing all 5 items while trying to balance fairness according to the given valuations.
