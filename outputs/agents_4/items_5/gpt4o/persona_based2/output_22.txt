Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  11  38  10  70
1  52  48  87   7  79
2  86  36  12  81  94
3  94  87  60  25  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 11 38 10 70]
 [52 48 87  7 79]
 [86 36 12 81 94]
 [94 87 60 25 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. We aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their valuations.

### Valuations Matrix:
| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 68     | 11     | 38     | 10     | 70     |
| 1     | 52     | 48     | 87     | 7      | 79     |
| 2     | 86     | 36     | 12     | 81     | 94     |
| 3     | 94     | 87     | 60     | 25     | 48     |

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuations for Item 0 and Item 1.
2. **Agent 1** values Item 2 the highest and will get this item.
3. **Agent 2** values Item 4 the highest and will get this item.
4. **Agent 2** also highly values Item 3, so they will receive this item as well.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: No items.
- Agent 1: Item 2.
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3: Items 0 and 1.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while trying to satisfy the preferences of each agent to the best extent possible given the constraints.
