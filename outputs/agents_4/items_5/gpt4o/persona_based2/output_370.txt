Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  71  26  37  27
1  89  59  92  35  84
2  38  85  62  69  71
3  37  88  90  55  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 71 26 37 27]
 [89 59 92 35 84]
 [38 85 62 69 71]
 [37 88 90 55 95]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we'll aim to achieve an allocation where the distribution of items minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer their allocation over the allocation of any other agent. Given the valuations in the table, we will seek a balance in the allocation process.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [81, 71, 26, 37, 27]
Agent 1: [89, 59, 92, 35, 84]
Agent 2: [38, 85, 62, 69, 71]
Agent 3: [37, 88, 90, 55, 95]
```

To allocate the items fairly:

1. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 1 (89). Assign it to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 3 (88). Assign it to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 1 (92), but since Agent 1 already has an item, consider Agent 3 (90). Assign it to Agent 3.
4. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 2 (69). Assign it to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4** has the highest value for Agent 3 (95), but since Agent 3 has two items, consider Agent 1 (84). Assign it to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and each item is assigned, minimizing potential envy. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 5 items, adhering to the constraints of integer allocations, and is aimed at minimizing envy based on the given valuations.
