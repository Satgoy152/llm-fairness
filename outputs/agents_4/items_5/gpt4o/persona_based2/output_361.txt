Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  35  65  14  98
1  79  40  23  29  33
2  57  43  10  60  26
3  58  48  27  90  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [79 40 23 29 33]
 [57 43 10 60 26]
 [58 48 27 90 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation whenever possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuation.

The given valuations are:

```
Agent 0: [64, 35, 65, 14, 98]
Agent 1: [79, 40, 23, 29, 33]
Agent 2: [57, 43, 10, 60, 26]
Agent 3: [58, 48, 27, 90, 43]
```

A possible allocation strategy is to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they get, while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. We can use the following approach:

1. Assign the highest valued item from each agent's perspective in a way that balances overall satisfaction.

A possible allocation based on this strategy is:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4 (98).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (79).
- Agent 2 highly values item 3 (60).
- Agent 3 highly values item 1 (48).

Now, we have allocated four items. We still need to allocate one more item. Agent 0 and Agent 3 have received one item each, while Agent 2 and Agent 1 have also received one item each. Let's allocate the remaining item to the agent with the next highest valuation among the remaining items:

- Item 2 is unallocated, and Agent 0 values it highly at 65.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is reasonably balanced based on their highest valuations.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
This allocation gives each agent a set of items that are among their higher preferences, achieving a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
