Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  76  61  87  50
1  15  55  77  90  28
2  59  92  11  62  30
3  35  91  79  67  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, to the extent possible given the constraints. The goal is to make sure that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations.

We have the following valuations matrix for the agents and items:

```
   0   1   2   3   4
0  81  76  61  87  50
1  15  55  77  90  28
2  59  92  11  62  30
3  35  91  79  67  77
```

A common approach to achieve a fair division is to maximize the minimum valuation each agent receives, also known as the "max-min" strategy. We can try to assign items such that each agent's lowest perceived value is as high as possible.

Here's a possible allocation that considers the valuations and tries to balance them:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them (90).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for them (92).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them (81).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 3, as it has a relatively high value for them (79), and this item is not as valuable to the others.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as it complements their allocation and balances the distribution.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and tries to respect the highest preferences of each agent. Note that it is not perfectly envy-free because achieving complete envy-freeness with integer allocations is difficult, but it aims to minimize potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
