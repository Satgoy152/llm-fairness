Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  30  95  34  62
1  26  37  42  54  25
2  64  78  26  82  58
3  58  96  83   4  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value. We need to ensure that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's start by examining each agent's valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [3, 30, 95, 34, 62]
- Agent 1 values items as: [26, 37, 42, 54, 25]
- Agent 2 values items as: [64, 78, 26, 82, 58]
- Agent 3 values items as: [58, 96, 83, 4, 84]

To find a fair allocation, we can use a method that prioritizes giving each agent their highest-valued item, and then proceed in descending order of value, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

1. Agent 0's highest-valued item is item 2 (value 95).
2. Agent 1's highest-valued item is item 3 (value 54).
3. Agent 2's highest-valued item is item 3 (value 82), but since item 3 is already taken by Agent 1, we consider the next highest, which is item 1 (value 78).
4. Agent 3's highest-valued item is item 1 (value 96), but since item 1 is already taken by Agent 2, we consider the next highest, which is item 4 (value 84).

Now let's ensure all items are allocated:

- Item 0 is not yet allocated. Agent 2 has a reasonable value for item 0 (value 64), so we can allocate it to Agent 2.
  
Now, let's compile the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 3 receives item 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest valuation while all items are allocated. 

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
