Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  59  63  18  63
1  28  31  40  14  15
2  23  80   3  81  21
3  41  71  88  67   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation given their own valuations. We can aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated matches the number of items available.

Let's calculate the total perceived value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 77 + 59 + 63 + 18 + 63 = 280
- Agent 1: 28 + 31 + 40 + 14 + 15 = 128
- Agent 2: 23 + 80 + 3 + 81 + 21 = 208
- Agent 3: 41 + 71 + 88 + 67 + 5 = 272

We will use a greedy approach, trying to allocate items to the agent who values them the most until all items are assigned. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 77 by Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 80 by Agent 2.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 88 by Agent 3.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 81 by Agent 2.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 63 by Agent 0.

Now, let's write down the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 2.

Here's the allocation in the json format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are assigned and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
