Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  34  93  16  43
1  77  14  97  17  68
2  30  97   1  76  37
3  22  79  12  70  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A fair division aims to be as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent should not prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations to determine a fair allocation:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 58     | 34     | 93     | 16     | 43     |
| 1     | 77     | 14     | 97     | 17     | 68     |
| 2     | 30     | 97     | 1      | 76     | 37     |
| 3     | 22     | 79     | 12     | 70     | 56     |

A potential fair allocation could be achieved by giving each agent an item that they value highly, while trying to minimize envy.

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the highest at 93.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the highest at 97, but since it's already taken by Agent 0, we'll consider the next highest.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 the highest at 97.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the second highest at 79, so we'll find an alternative as item 1 goes to Agent 2.

To ensure all items are allocated, let's distribute them as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (next highest after 2)
- **Agent 2**: Item 1
- **Agent 3**: Items 3 and 4 (to maximize their valuation given the remaining items)

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 valued at 93.
- Agent 1 gets item 0 valued at 77.
- Agent 2 gets item 1 valued at 97.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 4 valued at 70 and 56 respectively.

This distribution considers high valuation allocations and ensures each agent is getting items that maximize their utilities based on their available options.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
