Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  14  32  57  66
1  98  25  95  22  53
2  80  51   3  37   8
3  93  54  78  13  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 14 32 57 66]
 [98 25 95 22 53]
 [80 51  3 37  8]
 [93 54 78 13 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their valuations. This typically involves ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value more than or equal to any other bundle they could have received.

To solve this, we'll analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items to maximize perceived fairness:

### Valuations Table

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 91     | 14     | 32     | 57     | 66     |
| 1     | 98     | 25     | 95     | 22     | 53     |
| 2     | 80     | 51     | 3      | 37     | 8      |
| 3     | 93     | 54     | 78     | 13     | 85     |

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 1** highly values Item 0 (98) and Item 2 (95). Assigning both items to Agent 1 gives them a high total value.
2. **Agent 3** values Item 4 the most (85) among all items for them, thus they should receive Item 4.
3. **Agent 0** values Item 3 (57) significantly compared to other items. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 2** can be assigned Item 1, which they value the most (51) among the remaining items.

### Final Allocations

1. **Agent 1**: Items [0, 2]
2. **Agent 3**: Item [4]
3. **Agent 0**: Item [3]
4. **Agent 2**: Item [1]

This allocation aims to satisfy each agent based on their highest preferences, making it as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

### JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and that each agent receives items aligned with their preferences while minimizing envy.
