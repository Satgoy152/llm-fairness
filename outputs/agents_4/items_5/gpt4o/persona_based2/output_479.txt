Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  18  35  29   9
1  13  65  68  51  30
2   9  52  76  99  22
3  56  39  23  34  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should not prefer another agent's allocation over their own. In this context, with only 5 items and 4 agents, not all agents can receive items, but we can try to distribute the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [87, 18, 35, 29, 9]
- Agent 1: [13, 65, 68, 51, 30]
- Agent 2: [9, 52, 76, 99, 22]
- Agent 3: [56, 39, 23, 34, 28]

We aim to distribute the items to maximize their total valuation, ensuring that no agent feels envious of another's allocation if possible. Let's try to allocate items based on each agent's highest preferences:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (value 87).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (value 68).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (value 99).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (value 56), but it is already allocated to Agent 0.

Since Agent 3 cannot receive their highest-valued item, we check the next best option for Agent 3:

- Agent 3's next highest valuation is item 1 (value 39).

Now let's allocate based on these preferences:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1

We have 4 items allocated, and we need to allocate one more item. The remaining unallocated item is item 4. To decide who should receive this item, we look at who values it most:

- Agent 0 values item 4 at 9.
- Agent 1 values item 4 at 30.
- Agent 2 values item 4 at 22.
- Agent 3 values item 4 at 28.

The highest value for item 4 is by Agent 1 (value 30). Therefore, we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest preferences, given the constraints.
