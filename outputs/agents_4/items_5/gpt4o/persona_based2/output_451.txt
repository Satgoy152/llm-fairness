Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  76  88   3  49
1  69  32  79  40  68
2  10  97  85  16  63
3  63   3  45  69  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, ensuring a fair division that aims to reduce envy among the agents. We'll look for an allocation that maximizes each agent's minimum satisfaction.

Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Assign Item 1**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 97. No other agent values it as highly, so allocate item 1 to agent 2.

2. **Assign Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 88. Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

3. **Assign Item 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the most at 69. Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

4. **Assign Item 4**: Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 68. Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

5. **Assign Item 0**: This is the remaining item. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 at 69. Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

With this allocation, each agent has received at least one item, and we've aimed to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
