Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  95  55  68  56
1  15  65  87  16  37
2  16  34  28  64  54
3  73  82  13  95  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that considers the valuations given by each agent, we can utilize the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. While this problem is complex, especially with discrete items, one practical method is to use a heuristic approach to minimize potential envy and ensure each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Calculate the total value for each agent if they were to receive all items:**

   - Agent 0: 83 + 95 + 55 + 68 + 56 = 357
   - Agent 1: 15 + 65 + 87 + 16 + 37 = 220
   - Agent 2: 16 + 34 + 28 + 64 + 54 = 196
   - Agent 3: 73 + 82 + 13 + 95 + 87 = 350

2. **Rank the items by each agent's preference:**  
   This helps identify which items are most valuable to each agent. 

3. **Allocate items to maximize individual satisfaction and minimize envy:**  
   This can be done by ensuring that items that are particularly valuable to one agent are allocated to that agent, especially when such items are less valuable to others.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable allocation is:

- Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 0.
- Agent 3 highly values items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 values item 2 more than others.

Let's allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0 and 1
- **Agent 1:** Item 2
- **Agent 3:** Items 3 and 4
- **Agent 2:** No items (unfortunately, due to the constraint of integer allocations and total of five items, one agent will not receive any items)

Here's the allocation presented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the agents' preferences given the integer and total item constraints.
