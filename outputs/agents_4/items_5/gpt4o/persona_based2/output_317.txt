Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  12  74   1  32
1  73  92  92  14   6
2  44  20   2  44  23
3  69  53  22  83   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a simple method to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. This involves attempting to distribute items in such a way that each agent receives items that they value highly, and the allocation is as equitable as possible.

Let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   (Items)
0  70  12  74   1  32
1  73  92  92  14   6
2  44  20   2  44  23
3  69  53  22  83   6
```

A strategic approach is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Item 0 is most valued by agent 1 (73).
2. Item 1 is most valued by agent 1 (92).
3. Item 2 is most valued by agent 1 (92).
4. Item 3 is most valued by agent 3 (83).
5. Item 4 is most valued by agent 0 (32).

However, we need to allocate items evenly and consider all agents. Let's try another distribution more balanced:

- Assign item 1 to agent 1, who values it the highest.
- Assign item 2 to agent 0, who values it the highest.
- Assign item 0 to agent 3, who values it nearly as much as agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to agent 3, who values it the highest.
- Assign item 4 to agent 2, who doesn't have strongly preferred items.

This allocation is not perfect in terms of envy-freeness, but it is a reasonable attempt to balance the allocations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
