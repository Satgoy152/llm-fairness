Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  73  29  31  89
1  91  76  43  61  23
2  63  24  56  99  57
3  99  22   6  99  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [63 24 56 99 57]
 [99 22  6 99 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This can be complex, but we'll attempt a simple allocation that considers the valuations to minimize potential envy.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0: [49, 73, 29, 31, 89]
- Agent 1: [91, 76, 43, 61, 23]
- Agent 2: [63, 24, 56, 99, 57]
- Agent 3: [99, 22, 6, 99, 57]

One way to proceed is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each item goes to the agent who values it the most. This simple method can help reduce envy but may not eliminate it entirely.

Let's allocate based on this principle:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (99)
2. Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (73)
3. Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (43)
4. Item 3: Highest valuation is tied between Agent 2 and Agent 3 (99). Let's allocate it to Agent 2 to balance allocations.
5. Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (89)

Allocations based on this method:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 0

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed. This allocation may not be perfectly envy-free, but it considers maximizing individual agent valuations for each item.
