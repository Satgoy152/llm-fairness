Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75   2  78  34  57
1   6  71  46  34  83
2  86  10  64  42   5
3  58  30  25  48  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [58 30 25 48 61]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy among the agents by considering their individual valuations for each item. In this problem, we have 4 agents and 5 items, and we need to allocate all items such that each agent may get an integer number of items, and the total number of assigned items is exactly 5.

We can use a method that tries to reduce envy by looking at the highest valuations first. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 78.
2. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 71.
3. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 86.
4. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the most at 48.
5. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 4 highly at 83 and already has item 1, which results in a strong collection.

This allocation considers each agentâ€™s highest preferences while ensuring all items are allocated and minimizing potential envy in a straightforward manner.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
