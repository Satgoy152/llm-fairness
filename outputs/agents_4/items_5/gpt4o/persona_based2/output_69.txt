Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  65  26  99   9
1  23  94  18  71  79
2   5  78  11  72  54
3  72  78  97  36  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[12 65 26 99  9]
 [23 94 18 71 79]
 [ 5 78 11 72 54]
 [72 78 97 36 12]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the integer constraint on the number of items each agent can receive. Envy-freeness means no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4
-----------|-------------------
     0     | 12  65  26  99   9
     1     | 23  94  18  71  79
     2     |  5  78  11  72  54
     3     | 72  78  97  36  12
```

We need to find an allocation of the 5 items (indexed 0 through 4) to the 4 agents (indexed 0 through 3) such that each agent receives an integer number of items (either 0, 1, or more, but not fractional).

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 0: 99. Allocating item 3 to Agent 0 seems reasonable as it gives them a high-valued item.

2. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 1: 94. Allocating item 1 to Agent 1 makes sense.

3. **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 3: 97. Allocating item 2 to Agent 3 is a good choice.

4. **Item 4** has a relatively high value for Agent 1: 79. However, since Agent 1 already has item 1, let's consider Agent 2, who values item 4 at 54, which is relatively high compared to their other valuations. Allocating item 4 to Agent 2 is a reasonable choice.

5. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 3: 72. Allocating item 0 to Agent 3 would be fair since it complements their allocation of item 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, minimizing potential envy.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation respects the integer item assignment and aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
