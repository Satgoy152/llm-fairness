Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  70  49  91  87
1   8  48   0  49  17
2  85  19  83  59  99
3  80  40  69  81  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the items to agents in such a way that the allocation is as fair as possible. A common criterion for fairness is envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle. However, with indivisible items and a small number of items relative to agents, achieving strict envy-freeness may not be possible, but we can aim for a solution that minimizes envy.

We can approach this by considering each agent's total valuation and attempting to balance the distribution of high-value items across agents. Letâ€™s examine the table to guide the allocation:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  70  49  91  87
1   8  48   0  49  17
2  85  19  83  59  99
3  80  40  69  81  33
```

A strategy is to allocate items such that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuation relative to the overall distribution. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 3 (91) and item 4 (87).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 1 (48) and item 3 (49).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 4 (99) and item 0 (85).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 (80) and item 3 (81).

Given these preferences, let's allocate items while trying to balance overall satisfaction:

- **Allocate item 4 to Agent 2**: This is the most valued item for Agent 2 and one of the highest across all agents.
- **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values this item (91).
- **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**: This is the most valued item for Agent 1.
- **Allocate item 0 to Agent 3**: This is highly valued by Agent 3.
- **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This is a secondary preference for Agent 0 but can't be given to others without significantly decreasing their valuation compared to others.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest preferences while ensuring each item is allocated exactly once.
