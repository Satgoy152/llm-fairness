Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  76  65  95  60
1  37  10  82   7  79
2  67   9  85  78  37
3  69  12  90  28  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent is satisfied with the items they receive based on their valuations. We'll use a simple heuristic to achieve approximate envy-freeness: assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This method doesn't guarantee perfect envy-freeness but often results in a fair distribution.

Let's examine each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 39
  - Agent 1 values it at 37
  - Agent 2 values it at 67
  - Agent 3 values it at 69
  - **Assign to Agent 3** (value: 69)

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 76
  - Agent 1 values it at 10
  - Agent 2 values it at 9
  - Agent 3 values it at 12
  - **Assign to Agent 0** (value: 76)

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 65
  - Agent 1 values it at 82
  - Agent 2 values it at 85
  - Agent 3 values it at 90
  - **Assign to Agent 3** (value: 90)

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 95
  - Agent 1 values it at 7
  - Agent 2 values it at 78
  - Agent 3 values it at 28
  - **Assign to Agent 0** (value: 95)

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 60
  - Agent 1 values it at 79
  - Agent 2 values it at 37
  - Agent 3 values it at 70
  - **Assign to Agent 1** (value: 79)

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3
- Agent 1 receives item 4
- Agent 2 receives no items
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 2

The final allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
