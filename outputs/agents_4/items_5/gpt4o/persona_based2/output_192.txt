Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  17  58  88  71
1  46  88  34   2  88
2  17  15  27   0  58
3  53  54   5  68  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1 17 58 88 71]
 [46 88 34  2 88]
 [17 15 27  0 58]
 [53 54  5 68 45]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to ensure that each agent finds their allocation fair given their valuations. One approach to achieve envy-free allocations is to use the method of maximizing the minimum utility or using a round-robin allocation strategy, considering each agent's highest valued item that has not been allocated yet. 

Let's analyze the valuation table and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (88), followed by item 2 (58), item 4 (71), item 1 (17), and item 0 (1).
- Agent 1 values item 1 and item 4 the most (88 each), followed by item 0 (46), item 2 (34), and item 3 (2).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (58), followed by item 2 (27), item 0 (17), item 1 (15), and item 3 (0).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (68), followed by item 1 (54), item 0 (53), item 4 (45), and item 2 (5).

Let's proceed with a round-robin allocation starting with the agent with the highest value for any available item, and continue until all items are allocated.

1. Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 88).
2. Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 88).
3. Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 58).
4. Agent 3 gets item 0 (value 53).
5. Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 58), since it's their next highest available item.

Now, let's compile the results into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, attempting to minimize envy.
