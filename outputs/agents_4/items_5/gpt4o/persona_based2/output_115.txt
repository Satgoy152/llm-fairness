Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  72  27  33  78
1  16  32  26  58  85
2  63  74  48  12  52
3  70  17  78  94  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 72 27 33 78]
 [16 32 26 58 85]
 [63 74 48 12 52]
 [70 17 78 94 85]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures a balanced distribution of total valuations. Given the valuations matrix:

```
   0   1   2   3   4
0  71  72  27  33  78
1  16  32  26  58  85
2  63  74  48  12  52
3  70  17  78  94  85
```

We want to assign items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is as envy-free as possible. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy.

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 71, highest for Agent 0).
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 58, highest remaining for Agent 1).
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (value 74, highest remaining for Agent 2).
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 3 (value 78, highest for Agent 3).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (value 85, highest remaining for Agent 1).

The items are allocated as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 0
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 4
- Agent 2 gets item 1
- Agent 3 gets item 2

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is fairly balanced according to the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
