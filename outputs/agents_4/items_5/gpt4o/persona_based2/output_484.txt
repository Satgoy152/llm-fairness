Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  81  96   6  20
1  21  66  45  36  90
2  98  67  82  39  45
3  90  82  54  83  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 66 45 36 90]
 [98 67 82 39 45]
 [90 82 54 83 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free solution as much as possible under the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

The given valuations table is:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  81  96   6  20
1  21  66  45  36  90
2  98  67  82  39  45
3  90  82  54  83  77
```

We need to distribute these 5 items across 4 agents. A simple approach is to assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations in a way that reduces overall envy.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (96).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (90).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (98).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (83).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (item 1) in a way that minimizes envy. Given the remaining options:
- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1 (81).
- Agent 3 also values item 1 (82).

Assigning item 1 to Agent 0 would increase their total value significantly and is a reasonable choice given that Agent 3 already has a high-value item (item 3).

Thus, the allocations can be as follows:

- Agent 0: items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: item [4]
- Agent 2: item [0]
- Agent 3: item [3]

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
