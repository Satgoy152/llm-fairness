Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  97   4  62  70
1   0  40  28  52  64
2  75  30  95  61  63
3   2   5  71  73  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, also known as the max-min fair allocation. We will try to allocate items so that each agent receives an item or combination of items that they value reasonably high relative to others.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 3, and 4.
2. Agent 1 has moderate valuations, with the highest for item 4.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most.
4. Agent 3 values items 3 and 4 highly.

Given this, a reasonable allocation could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it is one of their highest valued items.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 to further balance their allocation.

This allocation attempts to give each agent an item they value highly, reducing envy. Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, aiming for fairness by maximizing the minimum value each agent receives.
