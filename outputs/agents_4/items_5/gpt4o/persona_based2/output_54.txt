Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  80  69  49  72
1  28  62  42  89  78
2  36  88  78  82  15
3  81  56  71  38  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free division where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We will use the valuations table provided to make informed decisions about who should receive each item.

Given the valuations:

```
         0   1   2   3   4
Agent 0  94  80  69  49  72
Agent 1  28  62  42  89  78
Agent 2  36  88  78  82  15
Agent 3  81  56  71  38  48
```

We need to allocate the 5 items to the 4 agents in a way that aims to maximize their individual satisfaction while considering overall fairness. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 94.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 88.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 69, but Agent 2 values it slightly higher at 78.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 89.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4 at 78, followed by Agent 0 at 72.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

The allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value highly, which should minimize envy. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation assigns:
- Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.
- Items 1 and 2 to Agent 2.
- No items to Agent 3, as their highest-valued items were allocated to others.
