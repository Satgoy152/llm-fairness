Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  56  45   2  60
1  80   3  88  90  36
2  87  73  64  73  14
3   5  61  44  22  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while considering the agents' valuations, we can use an envy-free criterion where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuation of the items.

The following is a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 0 the most (70). Allocating item 0 to Agent 0 ensures they get an item they highly value.
   
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 3 the most (90). Allocating item 3 to Agent 1 gives them an item of high value to them.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 2 (64). Allocating item 2 to Agent 2 would be beneficial for them.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 4 the most (95). Allocating item 4 to Agent 3 ensures they receive an item they value highly.

After the above allocations, item 1 remains unallocated. We need to assign it to one of the agents. By examining the remaining valuations, Agent 2 values item 1 the highest among the remaining options, with a valuation of 73. Therefore, we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item(s) they value highly, aiming for a fair division based on their preferences.
