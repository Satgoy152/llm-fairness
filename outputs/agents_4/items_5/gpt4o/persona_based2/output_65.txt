Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  22  34  13  40
1  43  50  70  61  47
2  52  51  67  42  75
3  79  13  34  88  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we must ensure that each agent receives items such that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items to minimize envy, even though achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible due to the discrete nature of the items and differing valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [40, 22, 34, 13, 40]
Agent 1: [43, 50, 70, 61, 47]
Agent 2: [52, 51, 67, 42, 75]
Agent 3: [79, 13, 34, 88, 93]
```

To find a reasonable allocation, we can use a strategy such as the maximum marginal utility or a greedy approach to allocate items based on highest valuations.

1. **Agent 3** values item 4 the highest (93) and item 3 second highest (88). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (67) and item 4 second highest (75). Since item 4 is already assigned, assign item 2 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest (70) but it's assigned. The next highest is item 3 (61). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** values item 0 and item 4 equally (40), but item 4 is assigned. So, assign item 0 to Agent 0.
5. Now, assign the remaining item 1. Agent 1 values item 1 highly (50), but since Agent 1 already has an item, consider next highest. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (51).

The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [1, 2]
- Agent 3: [4]

Each agent has at least one item, and we have allocated all five items. Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent an item they value highly.
