Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  98  52  72  22
1  74   6  71  92  51
2  33   1  60  86  85
3  76  61  54  20  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 98 52 72 22]
 [74  6 71 92 51]
 [33  1 60 86 85]
 [76 61 54 20 66]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we can use methods from fair division theory, such as the envy-free allocation. Our goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuation of the items, and no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [81, 98, 52, 72, 22]
Agent 1: [74, 6, 71, 92, 51]
Agent 2: [33, 1, 60, 86, 85]
Agent 3: [76, 61, 54, 20, 66]
```

A straightforward approach is to assign items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 81.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 98.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 71.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 92.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 85.

Let's allocate the items based on the above analysis:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Agent 3 will not receive any items, but this allocation maximizes the total valuation and tries to ensure fairness by giving each item to the agent who values it the most highly.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": []
}
```
