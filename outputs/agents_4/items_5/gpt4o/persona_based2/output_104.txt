Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  95  45  26  95
1  84  70  74  58   9
2   7   0  61  11  65
3  28  14  66  54  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other. We also need to allocate all items, and each agent can receive an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 and item 4 the highest (95 each), so we could allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (84), so we could allocate this item to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (61), so we could allocate this item to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest (54), so we could allocate this item to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item they value highly, and thus reduces envy.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 0, which they value the highest.
- Agent 2 receives item 2, which they value the highest.
- Agent 3 receives item 3, which they value the highest.

All items are allocated, and each agent gets an allocation that they consider fair given their valuations.
