Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  36  51  47  95
1  28  29  51  17  61
2  70   6  13  57  23
3  73  12  63  99  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 29 51 17 61]
 [70  6 13 57 23]
 [73 12 63 99 77]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy and ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given that there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will end up without an item.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4
0          51  36  51  47  95
1          28  29  51  17  61
2          70   6  13  57  23
3          73  12  63  99  77
```

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 95, which is the highest single valuation overall.

2. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3:** Agent 3 values item 3 the most at 99. This is the highest remaining valuation after item 4 has been allocated.

3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2:** Among the remaining items, Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 70.

4. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:** Among the remaining items, Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 51.

5. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3:** Agent 3 already has item 3, but he also has a non-zero valuation for item 1. Although Agent 0 values it more, since Agent 0 already received item 4, we allocate it to Agent 3 to minimize envy.

After this allocation, each agent except Agent 0 has at least one item. Agent 0 receives the item they value most and Agent 3 receives two items, aligning with their highest valuations. This distribution aims to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
