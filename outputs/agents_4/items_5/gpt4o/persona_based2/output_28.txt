Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  80  95  54  40
1  61  60  55  36  79
2  56  48  41  37  80
3  20  75  12  90  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations provided, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among agents and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach in such scenarios is the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns selecting their highest-valued available item. However, we must ensure that the final allocation respects the constraint of distributing all 5 items among the 4 agents.

Let's evaluate the values:

- Agent 0 values: 61, 80, 95, 54, 40
- Agent 1 values: 61, 60, 55, 36, 79
- Agent 2 values: 56, 48, 41, 37, 80
- Agent 3 values: 20, 75, 12, 90, 68

The items are allocated as follows:

1. **First Round of Picks:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 95).
   - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 79).
   - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 80), but it's already taken, so they pick item 0 (value 56).
   - Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 90).

2. **Second Round of Picks:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 80).
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 61), but it's already taken, so they pick item 1 (value 60), but it's already taken, so they pick item 3 (value 36), but it's already taken. They pick item 1 (value 60).
   - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 80), but it's already taken, so they pick item 1 (value 48), but it's already taken, so they pick item 3 (value 37), but it's already taken. They pick item 4 (value 80).
   - Agent 3 has already picked.

Since all items are allocated, let's ensure the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 1
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
