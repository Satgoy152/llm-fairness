Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  92  46  34  51
1  32  88   4   5  79
2  54  89  98  51  53
3  36  32  50   9  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 88  4  5 79]
 [54 89 98 51 53]
 [36 32 50  9 65]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation and attempt to distribute the items so that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we will aim to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly, while keeping the allocations balanced.

### Valuations Table
```
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4
0          29  92  46  34  51
1          32  88   4   5  79
2          54  89  98  51  53
3          36  32  50   9  65
```

### Steps to Allocate Items

1. **Analyze Valuations**: Identify the items each agent values the most.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by assigning items to the agents who value them the highest.
3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Reallocate if needed to minimize envy.

### Allocation Process

1. **Item 2 (Value: 98 for Agent 2)**: Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1 (Value: 92 for Agent 0)**: Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 4 (Value: 79 for Agent 1)**: Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 0 (Value: 54 for Agent 2)**: Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 3 (Value: 65 for Agent 3)**: Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocation

The above allocation ensures each agent receives the items they value most, minimizing envy. Agent 2 receives two items, as they have the highest individual value for item 2, which is significantly higher than other values.

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items considering the agents' preferences and aims to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible with the given valuations.
