Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  21  62  54  79
1  82  16  45   3  50
2  58  58  87  50  24
3  55  37  91  16  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 16 45  3 50]
 [58 58 87 50 24]
 [55 37 91 16 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations, we can use an envy-free algorithm such as the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) method or a simple round-robin approach to achieve a fair distribution.

First, let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [58, 21, 62, 54, 79]
Agent 1: [82, 16, 45, 3, 50]
Agent 2: [58, 58, 87, 50, 24]
Agent 3: [55, 37, 91, 16, 29]
```

To minimize envy, we can allocate each item to the agent that values it the most. Let's assign items based on the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (82)
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (58, tied with Agent 0, but Agent 2 will be chosen to balance allocation)
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (91)
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (54)
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (79)

Next, we need to ensure each agent receives at least one item or balance the allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
2. Agent 1: Item 0
3. Agent 2: Item 1
4. Agent 3: Item 2

This allocation ensures that:

- Each agent receives at least one item.
- The total number of items allocated is 5.
- The allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each item to the agent who values it the highest, ensuring a balance based on initial ties.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly across all agents based on their valuations.
