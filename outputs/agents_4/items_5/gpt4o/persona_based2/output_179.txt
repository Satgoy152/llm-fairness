Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  46  28  45  11
1  20  81   6  10  70
2   4   1  35  11  73
3  93  16  95  75  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 46 28 45 11]
 [20 81  6 10 70]
 [ 4  1 35 11 73]
 [93 16 95 75 96]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ideally moves towards envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's evaluate the given valuations and propose an allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (99), so it would be beneficial to allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (81), so it makes sense to allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (73), so we should allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (95), so we can allocate item 2 to agent 3.

Now, we have only one item left, item 3. We'll allocate item 3 to the agent who would benefit the most from it:

- Agent 0 values item 3 at 45.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 10.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 11.
- Agent 3 values item 3 at 75.

Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (75), so it would be fair to allocate item 3 to agent 3, thereby maximizing their satisfaction.

Thus, the final allocation is:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
