Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  86  22  90  32
1   7  75  52  32   0
2  82  23  18  45  60
3  77  32  22  40  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 75 52 32  0]
 [82 23 18 45 60]
 [77 32 22 40 28]]
Output:
In order to allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuations for the items. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

The agents' valuations for the items are as follows:

- Agent 0: [3, 86, 22, 90, 32]
- Agent 1: [7, 75, 52, 32, 0]
- Agent 2: [82, 23, 18, 45, 60]
- Agent 3: [77, 32, 22, 40, 28]

We will try to allocate items such that each agent gets at least one of their higher-valued items if possible, and the total allocation covers all items.

A possible allocation strategy is:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for Agent 2).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (second-highest valuation for Agent 2).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (Agent 3 has the same valuation as Agent 0 for this item, but Agent 3 will remain with no items otherwise).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated fairly based on the highest available valuations for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the agents' preferences while ensuring all items are distributed among them.
