Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  63  89  61  70
1  77  75  11  57  90
2  39  38  73  23  27
3  22  31  64  50  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to satisfy envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations from each agent's perspective and try to allocate items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (89).
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (90).
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (73), but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest valuation is for item 1 (38).
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (64), but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest is item 3 (50).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Final Item Allocation**:
   - Item 0 is left unallocated.
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0 (84).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 0].
- Agent 1 receives item [4].
- Agent 2 receives item [1].
- Agent 3 receives item [3].

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items. While perfect envy-freeness may not be possible in all cases, this allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest available valuations.
