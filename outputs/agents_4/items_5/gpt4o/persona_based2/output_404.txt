Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  40  23  89  40
1  50  40  31  37  72
2  57  45  94   7  28
3  11  85  98  91  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 40 31 37 72]
 [57 45 94  7 28]
 [11 85 98 91 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations and attempt to achieve an envy-free distribution. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a relatively fair share based on their preferences.

Let's begin by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0: [16, 40, 23, 89, 40]
- Agent 1: [50, 40, 31, 37, 72]
- Agent 2: [57, 45, 94, 7, 28]
- Agent 3: [11, 85, 98, 91, 83]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (value of 89).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4 (value of 72).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most (value of 94).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (value of 98), but since agent 2 also values it highly, we will consider item 1 (value of 85) for agent 3 as a second choice due to conflicts.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 as it has the highest value for them.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 since it is their highest-valued item.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 because it is their most valued.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1 to Agent 3, as it is the next highest value item that is not contested by others with a higher bid.

Since there are 5 items, we need to allocate the final item (item 0).

- **Agent 1** also has a reasonable valuation for item 0 (value of 50), and it would enhance their allocation without causing envy from others, as no other agent has a higher preference for it.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that agents receive items they highly value and minimizes potential envy among the agents.
