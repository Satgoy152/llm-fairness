Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5   8  68  12  99
1   2  42  41  23  69
2  93  61  54  12  28
3   2  58  89  82   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 5  8 68 12 99]
 [ 2 42 41 23 69]
 [93 61 54 12 28]
 [ 2 58 89 82  6]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0:  
  - Item 0: 5  
  - Item 1: 8  
  - Item 2: 68  
  - Item 3: 12  
  - Item 4: 99  

- Agent 1:  
  - Item 0: 2  
  - Item 1: 42  
  - Item 2: 41  
  - Item 3: 23  
  - Item 4: 69  

- Agent 2:  
  - Item 0: 93  
  - Item 1: 61  
  - Item 2: 54  
  - Item 3: 12  
  - Item 4: 28  

- Agent 3:  
  - Item 0: 2  
  - Item 1: 58  
  - Item 2: 89  
  - Item 3: 82  
  - Item 4: 6  

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (99), so let's allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1 (42), so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (93), so allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (89), so allocate item 2 to agent 3.
5. Item 3 is left, and it has the highest valuation by **Agent 3** (82), so allocate item 3 to agent 3.

This allocation considers the highest individual preferences and attempts to minimize envy.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
