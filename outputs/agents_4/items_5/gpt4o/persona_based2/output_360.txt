Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  50  57  11  61
1   6  16  24  16  22
2  40  52  96  66  68
3  10  37  59  76  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy between agents, such as the Envy-Free allocation method. In this context, we will try to distribute the items so that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [49, 50, 57, 11, 61]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [6, 16, 24, 16, 22]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [40, 52, 96, 66, 68]
- Agent 3 values the items as follows: [10, 37, 59, 76, 28]

A suitable approach is to allocate items based on the preferences, ensuring each agent gets one or more items and attempting to minimize envy.

Let's consider the following allocation:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as it's the highest valued item for Agent 2.
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it's the highest valued remaining item for Agent 0.
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3, as it's the highest valued remaining item for Agent 3.
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it's the next highest valued item for Agent 0.
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as it's the least valued item overall but highest relative remaining value for Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to give each agent their top choice or one of the top remaining choices, thus minimizing envy.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives at least one item and minimizes potential envy, given their valuations.
