Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  79  51  86  33
1   6  42  26  81  21
2   5  88  85  56  82
3  81  22  92  92  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness is a property where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the table of valuations, we can use a strategy such as the "maximum Nash welfare" approach, which tries to maximize the product of the utilities of the agents.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Determine the total valuation of each agent for all items to understand their overall preferences.

2. **Determine Potential Allocations**: Consider various combinations of item allocations that satisfy the condition that each agent receives an integer number of items.

3. **Maximize Nash Welfare**: Choose the allocation that maximizes the product of the utilities (valuations) of the allocated items for each agent.

4. **Check for Envy-freeness**: Verify if the allocation is envy-free or close to it by ensuring no agent has a higher valuation for another agent’s bundle than their own.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Total Valuation |
|-------|-----------------|
| 0     | 306             |
| 1     | 176             |
| 2     | 316             |
| 3     | 332             |

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (86), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly as well (81) but given Agent 0's preference, Agent 1 will benefit from item 1, which is the next highest (42) for them.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (88), but since it's allocated to Agent 1, we allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (82).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (92), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

This leaves item 0 unallocated. We can give this to the agent who values it the most among those who have not received many high-value items.

- Agent 3 also values item 0 highly (81), so allocating item 0 to Agent 3 balances the distribution.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [0, 2]

This allocation aims to be as fair and envy-free as possible under the circumstances.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
