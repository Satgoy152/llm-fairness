Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  24   2  97  55
1  39  51   2  85  38
2  84  20  84  84  87
3  74   4  74  85  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair division, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their individual valuations. In this context, a simple approach is to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation given their valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (97), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: After allocating item 3 to agent 0, we notice agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1 (51) compared to others, so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values items 0, 2, and 4 equally high (84, 84, 87). Since item 0 is also highly valued by agent 0, let's allocate item 4 to agent 2 as it's the highest value for this agent.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0 and 2 (74, 74). Since item 0 is still available and highly valued, we allocate item 0 to agent 3.

5. **Remaining item (2)**: This leaves item 2, which has relatively equal lower valuations across agents. We allocate it to agent 2, as agent 2 has no items yet and values item 2 at 84.

This allocation takes into account the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring each agent gets an item or an item they highly value. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their reported valuations.
