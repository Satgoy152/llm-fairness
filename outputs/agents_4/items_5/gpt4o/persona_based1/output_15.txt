Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  33  59  75  35
1  82  77  70  95  13
2  27  57  75  37  15
3  98  18  19  85  41
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation of items to agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. Given the valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's satisfaction given the constraints.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values items 3 and 2 highly. These items are also valued by other agents, but we will consider allocations that maximize the sum of agent values.
   
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 3 the most, followed by item 0. Given their high valuations, we should try to allocate one of these items.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 the most, followed by item 1. Since item 2 is highly preferred, we will consider allocating it to this agent if possible.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 the most, followed by item 3. Since item 0 is highly preferred, we will consider this in the allocation.

By analyzing the valuations and ensuring an envy-free approach, here is a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Item [3]
- **Agent 2**: Item [2]
- **Agent 3**: Item [0]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that aims to maximize their personal valuations, while distributing the items fairly across agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
