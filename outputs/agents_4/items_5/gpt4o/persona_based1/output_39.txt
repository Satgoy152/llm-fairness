Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53   9  69  23  58
1  90  90  53  81  70
2  97  99   4  77  56
3  78  42  53  14  80
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 99  4 77 56]
 [78 42 53 14 80]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, while considering envy-freeness, we want to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations. One approach to achieve this is to use the "Envy-Free Item Allocation" method, which tries to minimize envy among agents.

First, let's examine the agents' preferences for each item:

- Agent 0: Values items as [53, 9, 69, 23, 58]
- Agent 1: Values items as [90, 90, 53, 81, 70]
- Agent 2: Values items as [97, 99, 4, 77, 56]
- Agent 3: Values items as [78, 42, 53, 14, 80]

A possible approach is to use a round-robin selection based on highest valuations. Each agent selects their most valued available item in turn until all items are allocated.

We'll proceed with the allocation:

1. Round 1:
   - Agent 2 selects item 1 (99)
   - Agent 1 selects item 0 (90)
   - Agent 3 selects item 4 (80)
   - Agent 0 selects item 2 (69)

2. Round 2:
   - Only item 3 remains. The highest valuation for item 3 is by Agent 1 (81), but since Agent 1 already received an item, we can allocate it to the next highest valuation among agents who haven't received an item yet. Agent 2 values it at 77.

Thus, the allocations are:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1, 3]
- Agent 3: [4]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy according to the given valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible.
