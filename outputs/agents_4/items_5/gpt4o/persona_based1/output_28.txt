Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  52  50  78  21
1  54  64  22   7  33
2  95  99   2  10  91
3   6  72  32  82  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible, though a completely envy-free allocation might not be achievable given the constraints of integer allocations and the distribution of valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent places on all the items combined, which will help us understand each agent's preference profile and guide our allocation.

- Agent 0: \(17 + 52 + 50 + 78 + 21 = 218\)
- Agent 1: \(54 + 64 + 22 + 7 + 33 = 180\)
- Agent 2: \(95 + 99 + 2 + 10 + 91 = 297\)
- Agent 3: \(6 + 72 + 32 + 82 + 30 = 222\)

Next, we will try to assign the items in a way that balances the total value received by each agent, attempting to minimize envy. Given that each agent must receive an integer number of items, we will need to make compromises.

Let's consider a potential allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 3. This item has a low value for Agent 2 and Agent 3 values it decently.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2. This item is most valuable to Agent 2 compared to others.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1. This item is highly valued by Agent 1.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0. This item is highly valued by Agent 0.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1. This item is valued fairly by Agent 1 and less so by others.

With these assignments, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (Value = 78)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4 (Value = 64 + 33 = 97)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (Value = 95)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (Value = 32)

This allocation gives each agent a significant item or items they value, balancing the total perceived value to some extent:

- Agent 0: 78
- Agent 1: 97
- Agent 2: 95
- Agent 3: 32

This isn't perfectly envy-free, but it's a reasonable compromise given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```
