Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  19  57  42  88
1  93  67  13  22  70
2  93  16  75  15  84
3  58  34  18  97  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free division, we can consider maximizing the total utility each agent derives from their allocated items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible given the constraints of integer allocations.

Given the valuations, let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest at 88.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the highest at 93.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the highest at 75.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the highest at 97.

Assigning each agent their highest valued item:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, only item 1 is left unallocated. We need to allocate it to ensure that all items are distributed:

- Item 1 is valued second highest by Agent 1 (67), making it reasonable to assign it to Agent 1 as well.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to reflect their preferences as much as possible. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to achieve fairness by considering each agent's highest preferences while also ensuring all items are distributed.
