Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  76  32   2  36
1  57  56  38  50  18
2   5  12  19  41  77
3  33  48  57  99  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, one approach is to use a method such as the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW), which tries to maximize the product of the utilities of all agents. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we aim for a reasonable allocation that reduces envy as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 61     | 76     | 32     | 2      | 36     |
| 1     | 57     | 56     | 38     | 50     | 18     |
| 2     | 5      | 12     | 19     | 41     | 77     |
| 3     | 33     | 48     | 57     | 99     | 71     |

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 3 (99), so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
2. **Item 4** has the highest value for Agent 2 (77), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 0 (76), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 0 (61), but Agent 1 values it almost as much (57). To balance, give item 0 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 3 (57), but to ensure Agent 3 doesn't get too many high-value items and considering Agent 1's need for more items, give item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to balance envy while ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
