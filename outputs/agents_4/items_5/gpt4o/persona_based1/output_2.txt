Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  92  95  38  47
1  90   2  32  43  21
2  22  49  78  43  69
3  26  36  18  28   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, if possible. Given that there are 4 agents and 5 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each. 

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (95) and 1 (92).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (90).
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (78) and 4 (69).
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (36).

A possible fair allocation strategy is to first assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has, then adjust to ensure fairness and envy-freeness.

**Allocations:**

- **Agent 0**: Receives item 2 (highest valuation for agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Receives item 0 (highest valuation for agent 1).
- **Agent 2**: Receives items 4 and 3 (second and third highest valuations for agent 2, considering agent 0 already has item 2).
- **Agent 3**: Receives item 1 (highest valuation for agent 3).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one of their top preferred items, minimizing envy.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
