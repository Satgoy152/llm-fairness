Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  18  16  91  90
1  88  27  40  56  89
2  75  22  97  42  25
3  83  42  28  12  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[57 18 16 91 90]
 [88 27 40 56 89]
 [75 22 97 42 25]
 [83 42 28 12 78]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which means that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  18  16  91  90
1  88  27  40  56  89
2  75  22  97  42  25
3  83  42  28  12  78
```

Let's aim to distribute the items in a way that balances valuations as much as possible across agents. 

To achieve this, we can consider a heuristic approach that attempts to assign items based on maximizing total valuation for each agent while trying to avoid large valuation differences between agents:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as they value it the most (97).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as they value it the most (91).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as they highly value it (90).
4. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as they highly value it (88).
5. Assign item 1 to agent 3, as it's one of their higher valued items (42) and ensures they get at least one item.

This allocation should minimize envy to a reasonable extent given the constraints. The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
