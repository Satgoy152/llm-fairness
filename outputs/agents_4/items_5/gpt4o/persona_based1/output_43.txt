Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  22  41  63  53
1  23  60   4  75  73
2   9  63  41  61  76
3  40  28  73  27  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that they value as much as possible, given their preferences and the constraints of the problem.

We have 4 agents and 5 items. The goal is to allocate all items such that each agent feels that they have received a fair share according to their valuations. One approach to achieve this is by using the method of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy, where possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items in a way that maximizes fairness:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 63, so we can start by allocating item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly as well, but since agent 0 already has item 3, we will give agent 1 their next highest-valued item, which is item 4 (valued at 73).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 76, but since agent 1 has item 4, we will give agent 2 their next highest-valued item, which is item 1 (valued at 63).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 73, so we will allocate item 2 to agent 3.
- The remaining item is item 0. Agent 0 values item 0 at 23, which is the highest among agents who haven't yet received two items. Hence, we can allocate item 0 to agent 0.

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives items:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 0
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives their fair share based on their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
