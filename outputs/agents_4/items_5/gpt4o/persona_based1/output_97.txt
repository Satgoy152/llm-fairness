Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  93  31  73  19
1  93  66  19   4  58
2  42  56  35  11  93
3  59  12  23  34  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or, at the very least, minimizes envy. Given the valuations of each agent for the items, we can proceed with the following steps:

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 highly (93).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highly (93).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 highly (93).
   - Agent 3 values item 4 highly (81).

2. **Greedy Allocation:**
   - Allocate high-value items to agents who value them the most and consider remaining items to minimize envy.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 93 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 93 for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 93 for Agent 2).
   - For the remaining items, 2 and 3, check preferences:
     - Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0 (31), but Agent 3 will have no items if we don't assign this to them.
     - Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 0 (73).
     - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
     - Assign item 2 to Agent 3 to ensure every agent gets at least one item.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [1, 3]
   - Agent 1: [0]
   - Agent 2: [4]
   - Agent 3: [2]

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that every agent receives at least one item, thus aiming to minimize overall envy.
