Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  44  39  41   6
1  15  93  52  67  11
2   5   7  26   7  38
3  98  30  30  83  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [98 30 30 83 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must consider the concept of envy-freeness and attempt to maximize fairness in distribution.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 14 + 44 + 39 + 41 + 6 = 144
- Agent 1: 15 + 93 + 52 + 67 + 11 = 238
- Agent 2: 5 + 7 + 26 + 7 + 38 = 83
- Agent 3: 98 + 30 + 30 + 83 + 77 = 318

To achieve a fair allocation, we can utilize the following strategy: allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to individual items, ensuring no agent has an incentive to envy another agent's allocation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 3 highly values item 0 (98), so let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (93), so let's allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 1 also values item 3 highly (67), so let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly (77), so let's allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. Remaining item 2 has the highest value for Agent 1 (52), but since Agent 1 already has two items, we need to consider others:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 39, and Agent 3 values it at 30.
   - Allocating item 2 to Agent 0 would maintain balance, as Agent 0 hasn't received any item yet.

The allocations can be summarized as follows:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0, 4]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
