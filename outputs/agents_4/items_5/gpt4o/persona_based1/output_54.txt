Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  43  35  39  64
1  87  90  86  68  97
2  34  88   2  37  35
3  85  61  36  28  41
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use various fair division algorithms. One basic approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where we iteratively assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as it doesn't create an unbalanced allocation.

Let's evaluate the valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0: 62
   - Agent 1: 87 (highest)
   - Agent 2: 34
   - Agent 3: 85

   Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 43
   - Agent 1: 90 (highest)
   - Agent 2: 88
   - Agent 3: 61

   Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 35
   - Agent 1: 86 (highest)
   - Agent 2: 2
   - Agent 3: 36

   Assign item 2 to Agent 1. (Agent 1 has reached maximum items, but let's ensure fairness by examining other options)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 39
   - Agent 1: 68
   - Agent 2: 37
   - Agent 3: 28

   Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0: 64 (highest)
   - Agent 1: 97
   - Agent 2: 35
   - Agent 3: 41

   Assign item 4 to Agent 1. (Re-assess allocation as Agent 1 has 4 items)

To balance the distribution, we can try to reallocate items to achieve a more balanced and fair allocation. A possible allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [2]

This allocation gives each agent at least one item except Agent 2, balancing the distribution given the constraints. 

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2]
}
```
