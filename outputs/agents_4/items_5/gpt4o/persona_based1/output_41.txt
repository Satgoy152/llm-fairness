Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  49   8  87  25
1  78  92  48  40  69
2  14  97  13  16  90
3  81  99  30  28  98
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 97 13 16 90]
 [81 99 30 28 98]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum valuation each agent has for their allocated items. This approach aims to create an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible given the constraints.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 3 (87), 0 (56)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 1 (92), 0 (78)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 1 (97), 4 (90)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 1 (99), 4 (98)
   - Allocate item 0 and 2 to Agent 3.

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one item they highly value, considering their top preferences without conflicts, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
