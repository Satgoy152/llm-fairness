Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  57  70  64  47
1  24  96  88  14  57
2  98  68  15   3  29
3  87  62  57  40  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total utility or finding an allocation that ensures envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations in the table, we can attempt to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (70), followed by item 3 (64).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (96), followed by item 2 (88).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (98), followed by item 1 (68).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (87), followed by item 1 (62).

To achieve a fair allocation, we can aim to allocate the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (next highest available item for Agent 0 and fairly valued by Agent 3).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest available item for Agent 0).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and ensures all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
