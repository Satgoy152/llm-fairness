Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  11   0  69  47
1  99   7   9  27  43
2  88  23  28  91  47
3  84  68  90  53  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy among the agents. A common approach is to use methods like the "Envy-Free up to One Good" (EF1) allocation, where each agent may envy another agent but the envy can be eliminated by removing one item from the other agent's bundle.

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

```
        0   1   2   3   4
    0  17  11   0  69  47
    1  99   7   9  27  43
    2  88  23  28  91  47
    3  84  68  90  53  47
```

To allocate items fairly, we should consider the highest valued items for each agent and try to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of their preferred items. Here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 and 4. Allocating item 4 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest. Allocating item 0 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest. Allocating item 3 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 2 the highest. Allocating item 2 to agent 3.
- The last item, item 1, can be allocated to agent 2 as it maximizes their total value.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and provides a distribution that is fair and envy-free up to one good.
