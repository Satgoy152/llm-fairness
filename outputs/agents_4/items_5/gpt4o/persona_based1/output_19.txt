Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  61  45  14  15
1  42  94  10   1  52
2  72  80  21  36   1
3  51  19  37  79   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 19 37 79  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a simple heuristic method. Given the valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. This approach does not guarantee perfect envy-freeness, but it can help achieve a fair allocation.

Let's analyze and assign the items:

1. **Analyze each agent's highest valued items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (62).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (94).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most (80).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (79).

2. **Assign each agent their highest valued item if possible, while making sure each item is only assigned once:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it more than Agent 2).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

3. **Distribute the remaining items:**
   - Items left: 2, 4.
   - Agent 2 has no items yet and values item 2 the most (21). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Item 4 can be assigned to Agent 1, who values it more than others, increasing their total value.

4. **Verify that all items are allocated and each agent is considered:**
   - Agent 0: [0]
   - Agent 1: [1, 4]
   - Agent 2: [2]
   - Agent 3: [3]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
