Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78   0  32  42  61
1  25  88  94  18   4
2  73  79  54  71  43
3  29  23  44  62  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, ideally minimizing envy.

Here is a step-by-step approach for this allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuations:**  
   Look at each agent's highest-valued items, as this could help minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives something they value highly.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Valuations:**  
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value 78).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (value 94).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most (value 79).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (value 62).

3. **Allocate Remaining Item:**  
   - Item 4 is left after the initial allocation.
   - Agent 0 has the second-highest valuation for item 4 (value 61).

Given these considerations, the allocations can be made as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Item [3]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their highly-valued items, which should help to reduce envy. Now, I will present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
