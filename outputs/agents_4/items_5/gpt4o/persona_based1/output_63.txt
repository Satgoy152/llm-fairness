Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  41  77  97  80
1  90  17  10  67   0
2  80  25  69  96  67
3  36  13  96  59  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [80 25 69 96 67]
 [36 13 96 59 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, given their valuations.

Here are the valuations provided:

| Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 95 | 41 | 77 | 97 | 80 |
| 1          | 90 | 17 | 10 | 67 | 0  |
| 2          | 80 | 25 | 69 | 96 | 67 |
| 3          | 36 | 13 | 96 | 59 | 83 |

To achieve a fair and potentially envy-free allocation, we will consider the highest valuations and try to allocate items such that each agent gets the item they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4. The highest is item 3.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most, but since item 3 is already assigned to Agent 0, we look at item 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the most, but since item 2 is assigned to Agent 2, we allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Following the above analysis, let's allocate the items as follows:
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to respect the highest preferences possible while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
