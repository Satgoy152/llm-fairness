Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16   3  64  47  65
1  40  68  38  71  47
2  51  63  28  37  27
3  14  77  30  49  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [14 77 30 49 49]]
Output:
To solve this allocation problem, we aim to distribute the items among the agents in a fair manner, ideally achieving envy-freeness where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We have four agents and five items, and each agent has a different valuation for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item while maximizing the total valuation for each agent.

Let's summarize the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0: [16, 3, 64, 47, 65]
- Agent 1: [40, 68, 38, 71, 47]
- Agent 2: [51, 63, 28, 37, 27]
- Agent 3: [14, 77, 30, 49, 49]

To allocate items fairly, we can use the following approach:

1. Start by allocating the item with the highest individual valuation to each agent if possible.
2. Ensure that every agent ends up with at least one item, and no item is left unallocated.
3. Adjust allocations to minimize envy, if possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (item 4) to minimize envy:

- Item 4 has high valuations for both Agent 0 and Agent 1. Since Agent 1 already has a high-value item (item 3), we can allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items [2, 4]
- Agent 1 gets item [3]
- Agent 2 gets item [0]
- Agent 3 gets item [1]

This allocation is reasonably fair and aims to minimize envy.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```
