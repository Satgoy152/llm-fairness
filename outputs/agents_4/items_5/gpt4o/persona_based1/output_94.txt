Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  26  72  45  53
1  97  42  66  95   3
2  75  86   8  59  60
3  86  95  49  75  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62 26 72 45 53]
 [97 42 66 95  3]
 [75 86  8 59 60]
 [86 95 49 75 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that attempts to minimize envy among the agents by considering their valuations and the constraints that each agent should receive at least one item.

Let's consider the valuation table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 62     | 26     | 72     | 45     | 53     |
| 1     | 97     | 42     | 66     | 95     | 3      |
| 2     | 75     | 86     | 8      | 59     | 60     |
| 3     | 86     | 95     | 49     | 75     | 29     |

A possible way to allocate the items fairly is to use a method called the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) which balances the product of utilities. For simplicity, I'll manually assign items in a manner that attempts to balance the high valuations across agents.

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 97 is the highest available for Item 0).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 3 (value 95 is the highest available for Item 1).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 72 is the highest available for Item 2).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 95 is the highest available for Item 3).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 60 is the highest available for Item 4).

With these assignments, each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 5.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
