Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  98  69  51  59
1  64  40  42  89  13
2  23  33   6  70  87
3  96  54   0  66  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 33  6 70 87]
 [96 54  0 66 63]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations provided, let's attempt to find such an allocation.

1. **Agent 0** prefers item 1 (value 98), then item 2 (value 69).
2. **Agent 1** prefers item 3 (value 89), then item 0 (value 64).
3. **Agent 2** prefers item 4 (value 87), then item 3 (value 70).
4. **Agent 3** prefers item 0 (value 96), then item 3 (value 66).

A possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (value 98)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 89)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value 87)
- **Agent 3**: Item 0 (value 96)

This leaves item 2 unallocated. To determine who should receive it without causing envy, we need to compare the leftover item with the existing allocations.

- **Agent 0** values it at 69.
- **Agent 1** values it at 42.
- **Agent 2** values it at 6.
- **Agent 3** values it at 0.

Given this, assigning item 2 to **Agent 0** would maximize their utility without causing significant envy, as they already have the highest value item (1) and would not envy others with this additional item.

Thus, the allocation would be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 2
- **Agent 1**: Item 3
- **Agent 2**: Item 4
- **Agent 3**: Item 0

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
