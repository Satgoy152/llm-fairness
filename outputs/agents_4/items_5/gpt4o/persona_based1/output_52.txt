Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64   4   2  22  26
1  75  62  54  47  20
2  63  10  61  48  60
3  86  43  85  22  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the constraints, we want to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

To find a fair allocation, we can use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" approach, which balances both fairness and efficiency by maximizing the product of agents' utilities.

Let's evaluate the best way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values the items as follows: [64, 4, 2, 22, 26]
2. Agent 1 values the items as follows: [75, 62, 54, 47, 20]
3. Agent 2 values the items as follows: [63, 10, 61, 48, 60]
4. Agent 3 values the items as follows: [86, 43, 85, 22, 46]

After evaluating different combinations, here is a potential allocation that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy:

- Agent 0 receives item 0
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4
- Agent 2 receives item 3
- Agent 3 receives item 2

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and provide each agent with a satisfactory allocation based on their valuation of the items.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```
