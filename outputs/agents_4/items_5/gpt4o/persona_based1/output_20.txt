Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  30  56  73   8
1  61  48  52  25   2
2  56  43  60  86  36
3  20  74  27  13  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should receive a bundle of items at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle according to their own valuation.

Let's determine an allocation through a method that tries to minimize envy by considering each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (99). We'll allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 1 (74). We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (86). We'll allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, let's look at the remaining unallocated items: 2 and 4.

4. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 60, which is the highest among the remaining agents. We will allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 36, which is the highest among the remaining agents. We will allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

After examining these preferences and making allocations based on maximum valuations, here's the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by allocating items to agents who value them most, while ensuring all items are distributed.
