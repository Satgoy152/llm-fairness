Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  48  79   5  89
1  92  10  72  78   3
2  59  33  24   6   5
3  49  28  39  29  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach to achieving fairness is to maximize the total utility or value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Given the valuations, let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: Look at the highest individual item valuations for each agent as a starting point to ensure that agents get items they highly value.

2. **Allocate Items**: Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: Adjust allocations if necessary to minimize any potential envy, where one agent prefers another agent's allocation more than their own.

Let's analyze the table and come up with an allocation:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 and 4.
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0.
- **Agent 2** has relatively lower valuations, but item 0 is their highest.
- **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 2.

Based on the above observations, let's try to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value: 92).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value: 48).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value: 39).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 78).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value: 89).

This allocation seeks to maximize total valuation and minimize envy, given the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2]
}
```
