Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  51   5  87  89
1  94  70  11   0  80
2  33  35  97  56  42
3  80  36  10  48  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among agents, we will follow the concept of maximizing the minimum envy, which aims to minimize the maximum amount of envy any agent feels for another agent's allocation. We'll try to distribute the items in such a way to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Let's examine the values each agent assigns to each item and then allocate the items accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step process to determine the allocation:

### Agent Valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Values are [36, 51, 5, 87, 89]
- **Agent 1**: Values are [94, 70, 11, 0, 80]
- **Agent 2**: Values are [33, 35, 97, 56, 42]
- **Agent 3**: Values are [80, 36, 10, 48, 74]

### Initial Consideration:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (value 94), so it makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (value 97), so it makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (value 89), so it makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 0** also highly values item 3 (value 87), so it makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 3** highly values item 0, but it has been allocated. Agent 3's next highest value is item 4, but it is also allocated. Therefore, we can allocate item 1 to Agent 3, as they value item 1 with 36, which is their next highest available value.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: Item [1]

This allocation ensures that each agent has a set of items that they value relatively highly, and no more than one item is allocated to more than one agent.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation has been designed with the goal of minimizing envy and maximizing individual satisfaction based on the given valuations.
