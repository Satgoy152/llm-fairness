Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  26  49  17   1
1  88  93  58  27  73
2  69  57  64  39  34
3  24   6   4  89  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what any other agent received, according to their own valuations.

Let's summarize the problem:

1. We have 4 agents and 5 items.
2. Each agent has a different valuation for each item.
3. Our goal is to allocate all 5 items such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible.

Let's look at the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [88, 26, 49, 17, 1]
Agent 1: [88, 93, 58, 27, 73]
Agent 2: [69, 57, 64, 39, 34]
Agent 3: [24, 6, 4, 89, 44]
```

A potential approach to solve this problem is to use a round-robin method or to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's valuation given the remaining items, attempting to minimize envy. In this case, we will consider each agent's highest valued item that is still available.

Let's start allocating the items:

- **Item 0** has a high value for both Agent 0 and Agent 1, but Agent 0 values it equally to Agent 1. However, if Agent 1 doesn't get Item 0, they can still get high value from Item 1. Let's give **Item 0** to **Agent 0**.

- **Item 1** is most valuable to Agent 1. So, allocate **Item 1** to **Agent 1**.

- **Item 2** is most valuable to Agent 2. So, allocate **Item 2** to **Agent 2**.

- **Item 3** is most valuable to Agent 3. So, allocate **Item 3** to **Agent 3**.

- **Item 4** is not highly valued by any agent, but Agent 1 values it the highest among the remaining agents. So, allocate **Item 4** to **Agent 1**.

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
