Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  71  75  95   9
1  11  31  25  99  48
2  82  94  61   0  95
3   4  65  64  27   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is the product of the utilities each agent derives from their allocated bundle. This often helps in balancing fairness and efficiency.

In this problem, each agent should receive at least one item since there are 5 items and 4 agents. Let's analyze the values and allocate items to balance the fairness:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 highly (95) and item 0 (78). 
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 highly (99) and item 4 (48).
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 highly (94) and item 0 (82) and item 4 (95).
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 (65) and item 2 (64).

Based on this, a promising allocation could be:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, given their high valuation.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they have a high valuation and it's not the highest for Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3, given their high valuation.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it's their second-highest valuation.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to balance the overall satisfaction:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences and minimizes envy among them.
