Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  24  37  66  78
1  10  38  83  42  43
2  21  91  65  57  19
3  55  10  40  66  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 38 83 42 43]
 [21 91 65 57 19]
 [55 10 40 66 92]]
Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. One common method for this is the envy-free allocation, where each agent prefers their allocation over that of any other agent.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items fairly:

```
Valuations Table:
    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  24  37  66  78
1  10  38  83  42  43
2  21  91  65  57  19
3  55  10  40  66  92
```

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (87) and also values item 4 highly (78).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (83).
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (91).
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most (92).

Given these observations, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 or 3, considering both have moderate valuations here.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1: Item 2.
- Agent 2: Item 1.
- Agent 3: Item 4.

This allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
