Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  51  73  48  58
1  19  22  20  67  63
2  20  31  55  31  90
3  43  75  39  35  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20 31 55 31 90]
 [43 75 39 35 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives, ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation given their own valuations.

Letâ€™s first analyze the agents' valuations to find a fair allocation of items:

```
Valuations:
Agent 0: [6, 51, 73, 48, 58]
Agent 1: [19, 22, 20, 67, 63]
Agent 2: [20, 31, 55, 31, 90]
Agent 3: [43, 75, 39, 35, 84]
```

By inspecting these values, we can attempt to allocate items such that each agent gets the most value possible while minimizing envy. A straightforward way is to allocate items where each agent has a relatively high valuation, ensuring no agent is left with significantly less value compared to others.

Here's a potential fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 2 (value = 73)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value = 67)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value = 90)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value = 75)

Now, we have one remaining item, item 0. We need to allocate this item to ensure all agents have at least one item and attempt to maintain fairness:

- **Agent 0** receives item 0 as well, since it has a lower value for other agents compared to what they have already received.

### Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item they highly value, with agent 0 receiving two items due to the lower valuation others have on item 0. All items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item, achieving a reasonable level of fairness in the division.
