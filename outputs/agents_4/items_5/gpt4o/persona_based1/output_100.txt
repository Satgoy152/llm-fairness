Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  97  83  27  89
1  78  36  52  96  35
2   2  44   8  19  97
3  28  65  74  52  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach to achieve this is using the Envy-Free or Max-Min Fairness allocation methods, but given the discrete nature and small scale of this problem, we will use a simple heuristic based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent.

Let's analyze the valuations of each agent for each item:

```
Agent 0: [88, 97, 83, 27, 89]
Agent 1: [78, 36, 52, 96, 35]
Agent 2: [2, 44, 8, 19, 97]
Agent 3: [28, 65, 74, 52, 72]
```

We can make allocations trying to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring everyone gets at least one item if possible, which often aligns with fairness considerations:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent if possible**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 (97) and item 4 (89), but prefers item 1.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3 (96).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 4 (97).
   - Agent 3 highly values item 2 (74).

2. **Allocate items based on these preferences**:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

3. **Distribute the remaining item (item 0)**:
   - Item 0 has high value for Agent 0 (88), but since Agent 0 already has item 1, we consider the next highest:
   - Item 0 is of moderate value to Agent 1 (78), so it will be assigned to Agent 1.

After this allocation, the distribution is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent's highest or next highest valued item is allocated to them. Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
