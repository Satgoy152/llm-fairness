Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  32  62  76  51
1  81  73  30  36  76
2  68  12  35  13  58
3  28  83  38  47  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible. This means each agent should not prefer any other agent's allocation over their own. One common approach to achieve this is the "Adjusted Winner" procedure, but given the discrete and small number of items, a manual approach might be more practical.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 95.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 76.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 68.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 96.

We will attempt to distribute the items based on maximizing individual satisfaction while ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The most valuable item for Agent 0 is item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The most valuable item for Agent 1 is item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 3**:
   - The most valuable item for Agent 3 is also item 4, but since it's already assigned, we look at the next highest, which is item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

4. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2, which is their second-highest after item 0.

Now, we have one remaining item (item 3). We should allocate it to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 has item 0.
- Agent 1 has item 4.
- Agent 3 has item 1.
- Agent 2 has item 2.

Agent 3 values item 3 at 47, which is his second-highest remaining value. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest preferences, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and none is left unallocated.
