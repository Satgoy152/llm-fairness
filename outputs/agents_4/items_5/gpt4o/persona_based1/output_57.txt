Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96   7  75  82  55
1  32  73   1  64  33
2  24  22  34  55  63
3  70   1  99   4  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70  1 99  4 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here's a possible allocation using a method that aims to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (96), so we allocate item 0 to them.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest (73), so we allocate item 1 to them.
3. **Agent 3** values item 2 the highest (99), so we allocate item 2 to them.
4. We have items 3 and 4 left to allocate, considering the next best valuations:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 as 82, which is higher than any valuation by other agents for this item, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (63), so we allocate item 4 to them.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, minimizing potential envy among them.
