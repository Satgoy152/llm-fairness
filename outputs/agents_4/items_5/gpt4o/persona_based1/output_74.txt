Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  13  40  95   4
1  24  59  90   1   5
2  19  70  28  44  51
3  19  11  17  73  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [19 70 28 44 51]
 [19 11 17 73 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free or nearly envy-free allocation where possible, considering the agents' valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation Per Agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 3 (value 95).
   - Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 2 (value 90).
   - Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 1 (value 70).
   - Agent 3's highest valuation is for item 3 and 4 (value 73).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items remaining: 0, 4
   - Agent 3 does not have any items yet, and their highest valuation is tied for items 3 and 4, but since item 3 is already taken, item 4 can be assigned to Agent 3.
   - Item 0 remains, and since Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 0 (value 46), assign item 0 to Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure that each agent is included in the allocation, even if they receive no items.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the individual preferences as much as possible, given the constraints, and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, totaling exactly 5 items.
