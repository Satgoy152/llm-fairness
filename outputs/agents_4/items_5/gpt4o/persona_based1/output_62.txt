Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  22  86  76  91
1  82  79  55  27  92
2  37  14  69  78   6
3  94  65  39  66  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method inspired by the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction. This involves ensuring that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged by the allocation. We'll start by selecting allocations that give each agent a reasonable share based on their valuations.

Here's the approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 86).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 92).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 78).
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 94).

We need to assign the last item (item 1) to ensure fairness. We can allocate item 1 to the agent who would benefit the most from an additional item, which in this case, based on maximizing their total value, could be:

- **Agent 1**, who has a valuation of 79 for item 1.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- **Agent 0** receives item 2.
- **Agent 1** receives items 4 and 1.
- **Agent 2** receives item 3.
- **Agent 3** receives item 0.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations, ensuring that each agent receives items that are of relatively high value to them and minimizes potential envy among agents.
