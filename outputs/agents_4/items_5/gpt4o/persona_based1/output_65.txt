Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  38  28  58  88
1  44  26  45  97   6
2  21   9  21   1  95
3  55  43  34  90  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 26 45 97  6]
 [21  9 21  1 95]
 [55 43 34 90 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent. The goal is to assign the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their own valuations.

The valuations table is as follows:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  38  28  58  88
1  44  26  45  97   6
2  21   9  21   1  95
3  55  43  34  90  46
```

Let's attempt a fair allocation by considering each agent's highest valued items and trying to minimize envy.

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 the most (value 88).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (value 97).
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (value 95), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 2 (value 21).
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the most (value 90), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 0 (value 55).

Let's check the assignment:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** has items: [4] (Value: 88)
- **Agent 1** has items: [3] (Value: 97)
- **Agent 2** has items: [2] (Value: 21)
- **Agent 3** has items: [0] (Value: 55)

Items left for allocation: 1

Since Agent 1's next highest preference is item 1 with a value of 26, and Agent 0 has already received high value from item 4, we can assign item 1 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 1** receives item 1.

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [4]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 1]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: [0]

This allocation aims to minimize envy among the agents based on their valuations.

Final JSON allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
