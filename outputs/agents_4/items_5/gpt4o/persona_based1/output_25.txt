Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  88  74  26  49
1   8  96  19  22  67
2  44  72  42  38  85
3  92  38  37  12  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes satisfaction. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent to their own.

We have the following valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [74, 88, 74, 26, 49]
- Agent 1: [8, 96, 19, 22, 67]
- Agent 2: [44, 72, 42, 38, 85]
- Agent 3: [92, 38, 37, 12, 79]

A common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as this doesn't lead to a highly uneven distribution where one agent gets significantly more items than others. This method might not always result in a perfectly envy-free allocation due to the integer constraint, but it's a practical starting point.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (92).
2. Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (96).
3. Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (74).
4. Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (26), but to balance items, consider Agent 2 (38).
5. Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (85).

Let's ensure all agents get at least one item and allocate accordingly while maximizing total satisfaction:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 0

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the number of items each agent receives while considering their valuations.
