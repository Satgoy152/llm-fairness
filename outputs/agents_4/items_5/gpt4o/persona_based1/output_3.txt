Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  50  18  44  16
1  54  74  15  44  71
2  94  72  33  26   8
3  12  62  62  96  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure a balanced distribution based on their valuations. Given the constraints, we'll apply a simple heuristic approach to achieve an envy-free allocation as best as possible.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [16, 50, 18, 44, 16]
- Agent 1: [54, 74, 15, 44, 71]
- Agent 2: [94, 72, 33, 26, 8]
- Agent 3: [12, 62, 62, 96, 99]

The heuristic approach involves:

1. Assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.
2. Adjusting the allocations to minimize envy.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 2 (94).
2. **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 1 (74).
3. **Item 2** is equally valued by Agents 3 and 0 (62). Assign to Agent 3 since Agent 0 has other high-value options.
4. **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 3 (96).
5. **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 3 (99).

After the initial assignment, Agent 3 has three items, while Agents 0, 1, and 2 have fewer. To balance this:

- Reassign **Item 0** from Agent 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 2 has a high valuation on only one item.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0 (16).
- Agent 1 gets Item 1 (74).
- Agent 2 gets Item 2 (33).
- Agent 3 gets Items 3 and 4 (96, 99).

This allocation aims to minimize envy and ensure all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
