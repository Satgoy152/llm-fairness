Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  80  61   1  95
1  12  35  37  10  35
2  39   2  66  85   0
3  95  54  16  20  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach to this problem is to use the Envy-Free up to one item (EF1) criterion, which ensures that no agent envies another agent's allocation after potentially removing one item.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 63     | 80     | 61     | 1      | 95     |
| 1     | 12     | 35     | 37     | 10     | 35     |
| 2     | 39     | 2      | 66     | 85     | 0      |
| 3     | 95     | 54     | 16     | 20     | 95     |

An allocation strategy that minimizes envy and distributes all items is as follows:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 3: This item has a high valuation for Agent 3 (95).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0: This item has a high valuation for Agent 0 (80).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2: This item has a high valuation for Agent 2 (66).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2: This item has a high valuation for Agent 2 (85).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0: This item has a high valuation for Agent 0 (95).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and makes use of the highest valuations to minimize potential envy.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation assigns items based on the highest relative values, which helps in achieving a fair and envy-minimized distribution.
