Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  85  58  11   1
1  62  88  52  58  96
2  97  57  57  53  15
3  16  29  78   7  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free division where each agent feels satisfied with their allocation. One way to approach this problem is to use an algorithm like the "round robin" method or to evaluate possible allocations to minimize envy based on the agents' valuations. Let's consider the valuations and make an allocation decision:

Here's the valuation matrix for clarity:
```
       Items
       0   1   2   3   4
    0  9  85  58  11   1
    1 62  88  52  58  96
Agents
    2 97  57  57  53  15
    3 16  29  78   7  83
```

A potential allocation strategy based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction can be:
- Agent 0 highly values item 1.
- Agent 1 highly values item 4.
- Agent 2 highly values item 0.
- Agent 3 highly values item 2.

Now, let's allocate based on maximum valuations for each agent:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have one item left (item 3). We can allocate it to the agent who values it the most among those who have not yet been fully satisfied or have the lowest total valuation of their allocated items. By inspection, Agent 1 values item 3 the most among the unallocated items.

Thus, the final allocation is:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```
This allocation should help minimize envy and distribute the items fairly based on the given valuations.
