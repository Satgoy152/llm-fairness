Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  36   3  23  14
1  19  23  33  23  97
2  15  51  51  31  79
3  45   0  70  66  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider methods that aim to achieve envy-freeness or at least minimize envy. Given the valuations, one approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that any envy can be eliminated by removing at most one item from someone else's allocation. 

To achieve this, we can start by considering each agent's highest-valued item and try to distribute the items in a way that balances these preferences.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 45, which is also the highest value among all agents for item 0. We will allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 97, which is the highest value among all agents for item 4. We will allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values both items 2 and 4 highly but item 2 is not as highly valued by others. We will allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the most at 66, which is the highest value among all agents for item 3. We will allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 out of 5 items. We need to allocate one more item:

- Agent 0 can take item 1, which they value at 36. This is a reasonable choice given their remaining valuations.

Finally, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that agents receive items they highly value, thus minimizing potential envy and aligning with EF1 principles.
