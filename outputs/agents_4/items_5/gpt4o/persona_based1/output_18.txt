Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  28  36  81  31
1  78  92  49  81  45
2  59  69  15  35  23
3  84  54  98  80   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, the goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their valuations. This is a challenging problem, especially with integer constraints, but we can attempt to provide an equitable distribution based on the given valuations.

### Valuations Matrix:
```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4
-----------|-------------------
     0     | 55  28  36  81  31
     1     | 78  92  49  81  45
     2     | 59  69  15  35  23
     3     | 84  54  98  80   8
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Identify the item each agent values the most and try to allocate it to them if possible.
2. Consider each agent's overall valuation spread to ensure the allocations are balanced.
3. Aim for envy-freeness, i.e., no agent preferring another agent's allocation over their own.

### Allocation Process:
- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (81).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (92).
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly (69) but less than Agent 1, so we look for another high-value item for Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (98).

Based on these observations, let's attempt an allocation:
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 (highest value).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (second-highest value after item 2).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (highest remaining value).

This leads to the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

Each item is allocated once, and each agent is considered for their highest value items. This allocation attempts to balance the distribution while considering the preferences of the agents.
