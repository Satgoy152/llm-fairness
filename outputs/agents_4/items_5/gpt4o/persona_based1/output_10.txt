Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  60  56  40  75
1  71  67  69  57  38
2  36  99  39  11  31
3  86  74  28  71  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure an equitable distribution according to their valuations. We'll consider the following steps:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items so that the total valuation is balanced among agents.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(62 + 60 + 56 + 40 + 75 = 293\)
- Agent 1: \(71 + 67 + 69 + 57 + 38 = 302\)
- Agent 2: \(36 + 99 + 39 + 11 + 31 = 216\)
- Agent 3: \(86 + 74 + 28 + 71 + 72 = 331\)

Now, let's proceed with the allocation trying to balance valuations while minimizing envy:

1. Agent 3 highly values item 0 and item 3, and they have the highest total valuation, so let's allocate item 0 and item 3 to Agent 3.
2. Agent 2 highly values item 1, so let's allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
3. Agent 0 has a relatively high value for item 4, so let's allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
4. The remaining item, item 2, will be allocated to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0: Item 4 - Value = 75
- Agent 1: Item 2 - Value = 69
- Agent 2: Item 1 - Value = 99
- Agent 3: Item 0 + Item 3 - Value = 86 + 71 = 157

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and balance the total value received by each agent. Finally, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
