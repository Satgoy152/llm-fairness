Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  86  96  74   3
1  84  38  72  59  25
2  75  70  56  78  60
3  70  95  73  34  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [70 95 73 34 94]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach or similar fair division methods. However, given that this is a discrete allocation problem with integer constraints, perfect envy-freeness may not be achievable. Instead, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [74, 86, 96, 74, 3]
Agent 1: [84, 38, 72, 59, 25]
Agent 2: [75, 70, 56, 78, 60]
Agent 3: [70, 95, 73, 34, 94]
```

We want to allocate 5 items among 4 agents. Let's try to allocate items to maximize each agent's utility and minimize envy.

### Suggested Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [2]
   - Highest valuation for item 2 (96).

2. **Agent 1**: Items [0]
   - Highest valuation for item 0 (84).

3. **Agent 2**: Items [3]
   - Highest valuation for item 3 (78).

4. **Agent 3**: Items [1, 4]
   - Highest valuation for item 1 (95) and item 4 (94).

### Resulting Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.
- Agent 3 receives items 1 and 4.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item they highly value and aims to minimize the overall envy among agents.

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 5 items among the agents while attempting to consider their preferences based on the given valuations.
