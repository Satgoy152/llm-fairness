Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  42  75  60  84
1  20  87  91  72  50
2  26  87  34   3   1
3  74  84  35  74  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, we can use a process that tries to maximize each agent's total value from their allocated items. Since there are 4 agents and 5 items, one agent will receive 2 items and the others will receive 1 item each. Hereâ€™s an allocation that tries to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values items [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] as [52, 42, 75, 60, 84]. The highest value is for item 4.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values items [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] as [20, 87, 91, 72, 50]. The highest value is for item 2.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values items [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] as [26, 87, 34, 3, 1]. The highest value is for item 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values items [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] as [74, 84, 35, 74, 74]. The highest value is for item 1, but since it's already taken, the next highest are item 0, 3, and 4 equally valued.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Finally, we have one item remaining, which is item 3. We need to assign it to an agent. Evaluating the remaining unassigned items based on the remaining agents' valuations, item 3 could go to Agent 3 or another agent, whichever results in the most envy-free allocation.

- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 as they also valued it highly.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
