Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  94  41  72  14
1  44   3  14  47  65
2  11  13   5  83  45
3  10  62  76  49  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and aim for a distribution that maximizes fairness and potentially achieves envy-freeness. Envy-freeness is a state where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (94), which is significantly more than the other agents value it. This item should be allocated to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4 (65), so it is reasonable to allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 (83) the most among all agents, so item 3 should be allocated to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 2 (76), so item 2 should be allocated to Agent 3.
5. The remaining item, item 0, is valued the highest by Agent 1 (44), so it can also be allocated to Agent 1.

This allocation considers each agent's highest-valued items where possible while aiming to minimize envy.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and no items are left unallocated.
