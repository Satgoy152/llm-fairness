Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  59   8  76  77
1  38  89  34   0  96
2  15  83  55  42   3
3   9  55  25  78  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the integer constraint on item allocation. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**  
   Calculate the sum of each agent's valuations for all items. This provides insight into each agent's overall preferences and can guide the allocation process.

2. **Greedy Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**  
   Start allocating items based on the highest individual valuations to minimize envy. An agent should receive the item they value most among the unallocated items.

3. **Check for Envy and Adjust if Necessary:**  
   After an initial allocation, check if any agent envies another for the items they have. If envy is detected, attempt to swap items or reallocate to improve fairness.

4. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:**  
   Since there are five items and four agents, ensure that all items are allocated. This might result in some agents receiving more items than others.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- **Agent 0:** Valuations: [85, 59, 8, 76, 77]
  - Highest valuation is for item 0 (85).
  
- **Agent 1:** Valuations: [38, 89, 34, 0, 96]
  - Highest valuation is for item 4 (96).

- **Agent 2:** Valuations: [15, 83, 55, 42, 3]
  - Highest valuation is for item 1 (83).

- **Agent 3:** Valuations: [9, 55, 25, 78, 57]
  - Highest valuation is for item 3 (78).

At this point, each agent has been allocated one item based on their highest valuation. Only item 2 is left unallocated. Since agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for item 2 (55), we will allocate item 2 to agent 2.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
