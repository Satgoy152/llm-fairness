Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  17  59  60  34
1  11  75  81  60  45
2  86  44  31   3  87
3  78  96  63  88  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and aim for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences.

One possible approach to this problem is to use the "maximum envy-free" allocation, which seeks to minimize the maximum envy among agents. This involves considering each agent's preferences and attempting to allocate items in a way that minimizes the envy of the least satisfied agent.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the most (81), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the most (81), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the most (87), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the most (96), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have one item left to allocate (item 3). Let's allocate item 3 to the agent who would benefit the most from receiving an additional item while attempting to minimize overall envy. 

- Agent 0 values item 3 at 60.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 60.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 3.
- Agent 3 values item 3 at 88.

The highest valuation for item 3 is by Agent 3. Since Agent 3 already has item 1, which they value highly, giving them item 3 could be seen as increasing their satisfaction greatly. However, since they value item 3 above other agents, it is reasonable to allocate item 3 to Agent 3 as well.

Therefore, the allocation is as follows:
- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 3.

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
