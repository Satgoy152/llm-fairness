Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  87  63  64  89
1  67  76  70  98  28
2  96   9  54  42   8
3  68  85  35  66  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[14 87 63 64 89]
 [67 76 70 98 28]
 [96  9 54 42  8]
 [68 85 35 66 52]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly and ensure envy-freeness, we can use an approach based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. To start, let's list the valuations of each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [14, 87, 63, 64, 89]
- Agent 1: [67, 76, 70, 98, 28]
- Agent 2: [96, 9, 54, 42, 8]
- Agent 3: [68, 85, 35, 66, 52]

To achieve an allocation that is envy-free, we will assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This will minimize the potential for envy because each agent receives items they value highly.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (96)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (87)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (63)
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (98)
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (89)

Let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: No items

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, thereby ensuring that each agent should feel satisfied with their allocation, which is a step towards achieving envy-freeness.
