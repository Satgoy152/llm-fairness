Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  35  88  71  78
1  54  16  26  36   2
2  95  29  77  28  85
3  81  35  14   0  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a method that ensures envy-freeness, which means no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we can use a simple approach to allocate items such that each agent derives a high value from their allocation. Here's a detailed step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has very high valuations for items 2 and 3. Allocating these items to Agent 0 ensures they get maximum value.
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for item 0 compared to other items. Allocating item 0 to Agent 1 gives them a good value.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4. Since item 0 is already allocated, and item 2 is allocated to Agent 0, item 4 is a good choice for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 0, but since it's allocated, item 1 is the next best choice for them.

Following this logic, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 1

This allocation aims to maximize individual satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible. Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
