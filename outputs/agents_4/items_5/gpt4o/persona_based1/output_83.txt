Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  84  34  37  87
1  79  32  89   9  96
2  26  99  24  76  66
3   7   9  98  23  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent perceives their allocation as fair. One potential method is to use a Maximum Nash Welfare approach, which aims to maximize the product of the utilities of all agents. However, given the small number of items and agents, we can also try to allocate items in a way that intuitively minimizes envy and fairly distributes high-valued items according to the agents' valuations.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by determining which items are most valued by each agent and try to allocate them accordingly.
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.

Let's examine the valuations and make an allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4 (87).
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (96) but agent 0 already highly values it. Agent 1 also values item 2 (89).
- Agent 2 values item 1 (99).
- Agent 3 values item 2 (98).

To balance the allocations:
- Let Agent 0 take item 4.
- Let Agent 1 take item 2.
- Let Agent 2 take item 1.
- Let Agent 3 take item 3.
  
Now, Agent 0 and Agent 1 both have fewer items, so we will allocate the remaining item 0 to Agent 0 to balance the number of items each agent has. This gives:

- Agent 0: items 0, 4
- Agent 1: item 2
- Agent 2: item 1
- Agent 3: item 3

Now, let's present the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 5 items, and each agent receives at least one item, aiming to respect the most preferred items of each agent as much as possible.
