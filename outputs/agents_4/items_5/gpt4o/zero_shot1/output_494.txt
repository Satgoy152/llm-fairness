Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  83  69  96   9
1  11  35  99  74  61
2  84  86  23  81  94
3  12  52  17  78  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a reasonable allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (96).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (99).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (94).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (78).

2. **Assign each agent their highest value item if possible:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 cannot get item 3 as it is already assigned to Agent 0.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Items 0 and 1 are left to assign.
   - Agent 3 should get an item. The second highest valuation for Agent 3 is for item 1 (52).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Finally, assign item 0 to Agent 2 since Agent 2 values it quite highly (84).

This allocation ensures each item is allocated, and the agents receive items based on their preferences while trying to maximize overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [1]
}
```
