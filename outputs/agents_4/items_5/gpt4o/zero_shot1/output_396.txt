Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  50  19  27  43
1  94  48  27  59   8
2  84  64  15  93  99
3  48   0   4  67  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 64 15 93 99]
 [48  0  4 67 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. We can use a simple greedy approach by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 94 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 64 by Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 27 by Agent 1. However, since Agent 1 already has an item, we need to consider other agents. The next highest value is 19 by Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 93 by Agent 2. However, since Agent 2 already has an item, we need to consider other agents. The next highest value is 67 by Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 99 by Agent 2. However, since Agent 2 already has an item, we need to consider other agents. The next highest value is 47 by Agent 3.

Now, let's ensure all agents get at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 3 and 4

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are assigned based on the highest valuations possible given the constraints.
