Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  72  93  40  88
1  85  32  14  75  52
2   2  95  17  67  57
3  62  62  66  44  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing the total valuation across all agents. One straightforward approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can do it based on the given table:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Agent 2 Value | Agent 3 Value | Assigned to Agent |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 0    | 52            | 85            | 2             | 62            | 1                 |
| 1    | 72            | 32            | 95            | 62            | 2                 |
| 2    | 93            | 14            | 17            | 66            | 0                 |
| 3    | 40            | 75            | 67            | 44            | 1                 |
| 4    | 88            | 52            | 57            | 36            | 0                 |

Based on the highest valuation for each item, the allocation is as follows:

- Item 0 is assigned to Agent 1.
- Item 1 is assigned to Agent 2.
- Item 2 is assigned to Agent 0.
- Item 3 is assigned to Agent 1.
- Item 4 is assigned to Agent 0.

Therefore, the allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": []
}
```
