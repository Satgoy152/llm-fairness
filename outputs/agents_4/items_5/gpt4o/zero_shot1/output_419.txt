Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  12  89  57  76
1  91  59  49  17  13
2  52  36  78  34  26
3  10  73   3  50   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[29 12 89 57 76]
 [91 59 49 17 13]
 [52 36 78 34 26]
 [10 73  3 50  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that the total value perceived by each agent is maximized.

Let's evaluate each item and assign it to the agent who has the highest valuation for that item:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 29
  - Agent 1 values it at 91
  - Agent 2 values it at 52
  - Agent 3 values it at 10
  - **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for Item 0.

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 12
  - Agent 1 values it at 59
  - Agent 2 values it at 36
  - Agent 3 values it at 73
  - **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for Item 1.

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 89
  - Agent 1 values it at 49
  - Agent 2 values it at 78
  - Agent 3 values it at 3
  - **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 2.

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 57
  - Agent 1 values it at 17
  - Agent 2 values it at 34
  - Agent 3 values it at 50
  - **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 3.

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 76
  - Agent 1 values it at 13
  - Agent 2 values it at 26
  - Agent 3 values it at 9
  - **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 4.

Now, we allocate the items based on these evaluations:

- Agent 0 receives Items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.
- Agent 3 receives Item 1.
- Agent 2 receives no items.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1]
}
```
