Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  85  40  77  90
1  39  72  66  92  91
2  11  55  96  88  55
3  11  45  85  47  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 45 85 47 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. We can approach this problem by considering the highest valued items for each agent and assigning them accordingly. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are: Item 4 (90), Item 1 (85), and Item 3 (77).
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are: Item 3 (92), Item 4 (91), and Item 1 (72).
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are: Item 2 (96), Item 3 (88), and Item 1 (55).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 3 are: Item 2 (85), Item 1 (45), and Item 3 (47).
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated four items. The remaining item (Item 0) should be assigned to the agent who benefits most without exceeding fairness. 

5. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values Item 0 at 53, which is the highest remaining unassigned item value for any agent.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible.
