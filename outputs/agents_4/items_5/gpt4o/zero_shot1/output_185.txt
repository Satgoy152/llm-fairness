Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56   8  81  96  42
1  85  41  77  17  66
2  46  16  81  29  85
3  99  23  27  13   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56  8 81 96 42]
 [85 41 77 17 66]
 [46 16 81 29 85]
 [99 23 27 13  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. We should aim for a balanced allocation of value, not just quantity.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate items based on the highest preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is for item 3 with a valuation of 96.
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value is for item 0 with a valuation of 85.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value is for item 4 with a valuation of 85.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value is for item 0 with a valuation of 99, but since item 0 is already taken, we look at the next highest which is item 1 with a value of 23.

Now, we have items 2 and 4 left to allocate. We can allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as it complements their high value on item 3. However, since item 4 is already given to Agent 2, we need to adjust:

Re-evaluation:
- **Agent 0**: Keep item 3
- **Agent 1**: Keep item 0
- **Agent 2**: Keep item 4
- **Agent 3**: Keep item 1

Items left unallocated: 2

For item 2, Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it at 81. Since Agent 0 already has a high-value item, giving it to Agent 2 would balance the allocation:

- **Agent 2**: Add item 2

Final allocations:
- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Items 4, 2
- **Agent 3**: Item 1

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
