Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  56  98  43  99
1  93  11  74  61  18
2  67  88  16   2  48
3  46  12  72  12  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 11 74 61 18]
 [67 88 16  2 48]
 [46 12 72 12 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4 and item 2, with values of 99 and 98 respectively.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0, with a value of 93.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 1, with a value of 88.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3, with a value of 12.

Allocating based on these values ensures each agent receives at least one item, and we maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
