Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  45  11  78  91
1  25   5  36  31  55
2  41  43  88  94  75
3  97  78  41  44  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[19 45 11 78 91]
 [25  5 36 31 55]
 [41 43 88 94 75]
 [97 78 41 44 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations given. One way to do this is by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 97.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 45.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 88.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 94.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.

With these assignments, each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0 goes to Agent 3.
- Item 1 goes to Agent 0.
- Item 2 goes to Agent 2.
- Item 3 goes to Agent 2.
- Item 4 goes to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
