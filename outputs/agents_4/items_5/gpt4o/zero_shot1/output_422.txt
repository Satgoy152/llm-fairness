Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  76  57  27  75
1  78  45  98  38   7
2  80  86  65  56  60
3  85  90  31  26  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 76 57 27 75]
 [78 45 98 38  7]
 [80 86 65 56 60]
 [85 90 31 26 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can look at the valuations each agent has for each item and attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. We can use a method that aims to ensure that agents receive items for which they have relatively high valuations.

Let's evaluate a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 3 since agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 (90).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1 since agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (98).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 2 since agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0 (80).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2 since agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (56).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0 since agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 4 (75).

With this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
