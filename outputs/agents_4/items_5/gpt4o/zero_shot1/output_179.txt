Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  98  21  65  83
1  43  55  52  62  53
2  36  61  93  33  54
3  42  82  63  54  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (98).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (62).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (93).
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the highest (82).

Next, we can assign the remaining item (item 0). The highest valuation for item 0 is by Agent 0 (86). However, since Agent 0 already has item 1, we will consider the next highest valuation for item 0:

1. **Agent 2** has the second highest valuation for item 0 (36).

With that, the allocation can look like this:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [2, 0]
- Agent 3: [4]

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
