Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  50  47  77  99
1  89  60  57  32  19
2  44   6  25  85  21
3  44  43  62  84  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 60 57 32 19]
 [44  6 25 85 21]
 [44 43 62 84 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of the items. A common approach is to ensure that each agent receives the item(s) they value the most, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's examine the items and choose allocations that maximize total satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: 54, 50, 47, 77, 99
   - Highest value: Item 4 (99)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: 89, 60, 57, 32, 19
   - Highest value: Item 0 (89)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: 44, 6, 25, 85, 21
   - Highest value: Item 3 (85)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: 44, 43, 62, 84, 54
   - Highest value: Item 2 (62)

Now, assign the items based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 gets Item 4.
- Agent 1 gets Item 0.
- Agent 2 gets Item 3.
- Agent 3 gets Item 2.

This leaves Item 1, which must be allocated. The highest remaining valuation for Item 1 is by Agent 1 (60). However, since Agent 1 already has an item, we look for the next highest valuation that hasn't been allocated yet:

- Agent 3 has the second-highest valuation for Item 1 (43).

So, allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
