Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  15  74  33  10
1  89  60  88  34  79
2  48  44  84  32  43
3  74  67  78  66  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[59 15 74 33 10]
 [89 60 88 34 79]
 [48 44 84 32 43]
 [74 67 78 66 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. We will assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual preferences, ensuring each item is allocated exactly once.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [59, 15, 74, 33, 10]
Agent 1: [89, 60, 88, 34, 79]
Agent 2: [48, 44, 84, 32, 43]
Agent 3: [74, 67, 78, 66, 32]
```

We can allocate items as follows:

1. **Item 0** has the highest value to Agent 1 (89).
2. **Item 1** has the highest value to Agent 3 (67).
3. **Item 2** has the highest value to Agent 1 (88).
4. **Item 3** has the highest value to Agent 3 (66).
5. **Item 4** has the highest value to Agent 1 (79).

Now we see that Agent 1 is currently over-allocated. We need to adjust to ensure all agents have a fair distribution. Let's adjust:

- Assign **Item 0** to Agent 1.
- Assign **Item 1** to Agent 3.
- Assign **Item 2** to Agent 0.
- Assign **Item 3** to Agent 2.
- Assign **Item 4** to Agent 3.

This allocation provides a balanced distribution while respecting individual preferences.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This ensures each agent receives at least one item based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.
