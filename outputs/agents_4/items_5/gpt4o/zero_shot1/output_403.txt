Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  83  93  19  70
1  82  36  87  81   4
2  95   5  22  62   1
3  12  93   7  77  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 5. In this scenario, a typical approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations of the items for each agent.

Let's consider the allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Values: [10, 83, 93, 19, 70]

2. Agent 1:
   - Values: [82, 36, 87, 81, 4]

3. Agent 2:
   - Values: [95, 5, 22, 62, 1]

4. Agent 3:
   - Values: [12, 93, 7, 77, 22]

A possible allocation strategy could be to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 93.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it second highest at 70 (Agent 0 now has two items, but this maximizes total valuation).

Now, each item is allocated based on the highest valuation by the agents, and we ensure only 5 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value of the items for the agents based on the given valuations.
