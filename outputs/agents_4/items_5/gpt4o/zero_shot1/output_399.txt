Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  98  78  26  29
1  99  87  75  57  29
2  71  23  71   3  79
3  95  51  90  81  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[23 98 78 26 29]
 [99 87 75 57 29]
 [71 23 71  3 79]
 [95 51 90 81 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We'll use a simple approach to assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has for an item.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [23, 98, 78, 26, 29]
   - Highest value: 98 for item 1

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [99, 87, 75, 57, 29]
   - Highest value: 99 for item 0

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [71, 23, 71, 3, 79]
   - Highest value: 79 for item 4

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [95, 51, 90, 81, 60]
   - Highest value: 95 for item 0 (already assigned), next highest is 90 for item 2

Let's allocate items based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0 gets item 1
- Agent 1 gets item 0
- Agent 2 gets item 4
- Agent 3 gets item 2

Now, we have 1 item left to allocate (item 3). We will allocate it to the agent with the highest remaining value for that item:

- Agent 0 has value 26 for item 3
- Agent 1 has value 57 for item 3
- Agent 2 has value 3 for item 3
- Agent 3 has value 81 for item 3

Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3, so we will allocate item 3 to agent 3.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
