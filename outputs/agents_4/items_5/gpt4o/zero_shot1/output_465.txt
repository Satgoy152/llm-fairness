Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  11  93  79  65
1  41  28  89  17  53
2  45  61  38  42  69
3  26  88  45  84  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [26 88 45 84 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will aim to distribute the items based on the highest valuations per agent.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (93), Item 3 (79), Item 0 (69)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (89), Item 4 (53), Item 0 (41)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (69), Item 1 (61), Item 3 (42)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (88), Item 3 (84), Item 2 (45)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate one more item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

5. **Remaining Item**:
   - The remaining item is Item 0.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 as they have the next highest valuation for any remaining item (69).

By following this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, and we maximize the overall satisfaction based on the highest possible valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
