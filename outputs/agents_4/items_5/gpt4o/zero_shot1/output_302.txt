Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  50  49  63  84
1  40  22  51  90  88
2  96  44  73  65  81
3  38  34  37  40  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [38 34 37 40 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the agents' valuations and try to maximize the total perceived value while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's look at the valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 84.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 90.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 96.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 at 59, which is the highest among the remaining items after the highest-valued items are considered for each agent.

Now let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Assign item 0 to agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (as they have the next highest valuation for this item).
- Assign item 2 to agent 2 (as they have the next highest valuation for this item).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value the most, while also distributing all 5 items fairly. Now, let's format this into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value perceived by the agents based on their item valuations and ensures each item is allocated to only one agent.
