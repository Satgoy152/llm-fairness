Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  14  79  12  78
1  20  36  60  53  43
2  31  57  83  19   2
3  44   6  69  26  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 14 79 12 78]
 [20 36 60 53 43]
 [31 57 83 19  2]
 [44  6 69 26 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated to one agent only. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [58, 14, 79, 12, 78]
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (79), Item 4 (78)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [20, 36, 60, 53, 43]
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (60), Item 3 (53)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [31, 57, 83, 19, 2]
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (83), Item 1 (57)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [44, 6, 69, 26, 62]
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (69), Item 4 (62)

Considering these valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate Item 4 (78) to Agent 0 because it's one of their highest valued items.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate Item 3 (53) to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate Item 2 (83) to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate Item 0 (44) to Agent 3.

Now we have allocated 4 items. The remaining item, Item 1, has the highest value for Agent 2 among those not yet assigned, so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
