Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  97  84  63  28
1  28  21  99   5  17
2  45  66  51  18  54
3  53   9  22   8  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 97 84 63 28]
 [28 21 99  5 17]
 [45 66 51 18 54]
 [53  9 22  8 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Since there are 4 agents and 5 items, one agent will not receive any items. We will use a greedy approach to assign items based on the highest valuations per agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [27, 97, 84, 63, 28]
- Agent 1: [28, 21, 99, 5, 17]
- Agent 2: [45, 66, 51, 18, 54]
- Agent 3: [53, 9, 22, 8, 20]

First, we will assign the highest valued item to each agent if possible, then allocate the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (99).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 second highest (66), but item 1 is already assigned to agent 0, so assign item 0 (45).
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (53), but item 0 is already assigned to agent 2, so assign item 3 (8).

2. Check remaining items and assign them:
   - Items 3 and 4 are left. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (54) as it's the next highest valuation available for agent 2.
   - Item 3 remains and cannot be assigned to agent 3 as agent 3 has the lowest remaining valuations. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (63).

3. Final allocation:
   - Agent 0: [1, 3]
   - Agent 1: [2]
   - Agent 2: [0, 4]
   - Agent 3: []

The allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": []
}
```
