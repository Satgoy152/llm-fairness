Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  30  38  11  73
1  46  35  51  83  48
2  34  87  46  55   3
3  89  17  55   0  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 30 38 11 73]
 [46 35 51 83 48]
 [34 87 46 55  3]
 [89 17 55  0 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the valuations given in the table. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Item 0:** The values for item 0 are [35, 46, 34, 89]. Agent 3 values this item the most.
2. **Item 1:** The values for item 1 are [30, 35, 87, 17]. Agent 2 values this item the most.
3. **Item 2:** The values for item 2 are [38, 51, 46, 55]. Agent 1 values this item the most.
4. **Item 3:** The values for item 3 are [11, 83, 55, 0]. Agent 1 values this item the most, but since agent 1 already has item 2, we consider the next highest, which is agent 2.
5. **Item 4:** The values for item 4 are [73, 48, 3, 46]. Agent 0 values this item the most.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item:
- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.

For item 3, since agent 2 already has an item, we need to reallocate to maintain fairness:
- Since agent 1 also values item 3 highly, they can take it, but they already have item 2. So, we can give item 3 to agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and we have allocated all 5 items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```
