Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  71  32  17  84
1  25  70  53  41  88
2  54  97  48  53  62
3   7  57  81  27  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes total satisfaction. One approach is to consider the highest valuation for each item and assign that item to the corresponding agent, ensuring that each agent can receive at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 54.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 97.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 81.

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 41.

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 88.

By allocating based on these highest valuations, we ensure that each item goes to the agent who values it the most. Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 3 receives item 2.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned and maximizes total value across all agents.
