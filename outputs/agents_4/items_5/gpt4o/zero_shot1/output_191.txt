Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  87  76  53  65
1  25  59  25  51  28
2   9  63  55  85  52
3  30  83  61  41  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation based on the agents' preferences. One common approach is the "maximum sum allocation," which seeks to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes the total valuation. This approach doesn't necessarily ensure individual fairness in terms of equal distribution of items or individual satisfaction but helps maximize overall efficiency.

Here's a step-by-step method to perform the allocation:

1. List all the valuations and their corresponding agent-item pairs.
2. Sort these pairs in descending order based on the valuation.
3. Allocate items to agents starting from the highest valuation, ensuring that each item is only allocated once and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's perform this allocation:

1. Create a list of all valuations with their corresponding agent-item pairs:
   - (87, 0, 1)
   - (83, 3, 1)
   - (85, 2, 3)
   - (76, 0, 2)
   - (68, 3, 4)
   - (65, 0, 4)
   - (63, 2, 1)
   - (61, 3, 2)
   - (59, 1, 1)
   - (55, 2, 2)
   - (53, 0, 3)
   - (52, 2, 4)
   - (51, 1, 3)
   - (41, 3, 3)
   - (30, 3, 0)
   - (28, 1, 4)
   - (25, 1, 2)
   - (25, 1, 0)
   - (18, 0, 0)
   - (9, 2, 0)

2. Sort this list in descending order based on valuation:
   - (87, 0, 1)
   - (85, 2, 3)
   - (83, 3, 1)
   - (76, 0, 2)
   - (68, 3, 4)
   - (65, 0, 4)
   - (63, 2, 1)
   - (61, 3, 2)
   - (59, 1, 1)
   - (55, 2, 2)
   - (53, 0, 3)
   - (52, 2, 4)
   - (51, 1, 3)
   - (41, 3, 3)
   - (30, 3, 0)
   - (28, 1, 4)
   - (25, 1, 2)
   - (25, 1, 0)
   - (18, 0, 0)
   - (9, 2, 0)

3. Allocate items to agents:
   - Assign item 1 to agent 0 (valuation: 87)
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2 (valuation: 85)
   - Assign item 4 to agent 3 (valuation: 68)
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0 (valuation: 76)
   - Assign item 0 to agent 3 (valuation: 30)

Now, each item has been allocated, and the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total valuation is reasonably high.
