Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  81  68  81  30
1  89  54  11  65  48
2  42  29  81  38   8
3  50  22  66  10  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can employ a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations, the goal is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent gets at least zero items.

Let's break down the valuations for each item by agent:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0: 27
  - Agent 1: 89
  - Agent 2: 42
  - Agent 3: 50
  - Highest value: Agent 1

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 81
  - Agent 1: 54
  - Agent 2: 29
  - Agent 3: 22
  - Highest value: Agent 0

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 68
  - Agent 1: 11
  - Agent 2: 81
  - Agent 3: 66
  - Highest value: Agent 2

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 81
  - Agent 1: 65
  - Agent 2: 38
  - Agent 3: 10
  - Highest value: Agent 0

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0: 30
  - Agent 1: 48
  - Agent 2: 8
  - Agent 3: 38
  - Highest value: Agent 1

From this analysis, we can assign items to agents as follows based on the highest valuation for each item, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: No items

Now, let's format these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": []
}
```
