Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  38  76  45  20
1  77  79  39  42  52
2  18  93  77  56  30
3  84   1  49  56  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 38 76 45 20]
 [77 79 39 42 52]
 [18 93 77 56 30]
 [84  1 49 56 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent considering they get at least one item. Hereâ€™s one approach to do that:

1. List the agents and their valuations:
   - Agent 0: [8, 38, 76, 45, 20]
   - Agent 1: [77, 79, 39, 42, 52]
   - Agent 2: [18, 93, 77, 56, 30]
   - Agent 3: [84, 1, 49, 56, 52]

2. We can start by assigning the item with the highest valuation to each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. Allocate remaining items to maximize total valuations while ensuring fairness.

Let's proceed with this allocation plan:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most with 76.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most with 79.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most with 93, but it is already taken by Agent 1, so we assign item 2 valued at 77.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most with 84.

Now we have:
- Agent 0 with item 2.
- Agent 1 with item 1.
- Agent 2 with item 3.
- Agent 3 with item 0.

Only one item, item 4, remains unallocated:
- Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for item 4 with 52.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [0]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
