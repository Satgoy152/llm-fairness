Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  18  61  47  36
1  26  91  32  76  54
2  39   0  31   3  35
3  30  52  28  45  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent derives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent receives a fair chance at obtaining valuable items. Given the valuation matrix, one common approach is to use a method that considers maximizing the sum of values, such as the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, but since the goal here is a fair allocation (and not purely value maximization), we will attempt a different approach.

Here's a step-by-step attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0 has a high value of 74 for Agent 0, which is the highest value for this item across all agents. 
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1 has a value of 91 for Agent 1, which is the highest among all agents for this item.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items 2 and 4 are relatively close in value for Agent 2 (31 and 35), but since item 2 has a unique high value for Agent 1 (32, which is not higher than Agent 1's value for item 1), we can prioritize item 4.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - For Agent 3, item 3 has a value of 45, which is the highest value for this agent across all items.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Revisiting unallocated items**:
   - Item 2 remains unallocated. It has a relatively high value for Agent 0 (61).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, given Agent 0's high valuation for it.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the value they derive from their allocations as fairly as possible given the constraints.
