Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  60  21  74  16
1  61  81  28  88  59
2  74  81  72   9  25
3  76  64  87  47  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 60 21 74 16]
 [61 81 28 88 59]
 [74 81 72  9 25]
 [76 64 87 47 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total value or ensuring that each agent gets at least one item they value highly. One way to approach this is by assigning items to the agents such that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is maximized while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. 

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [55, 60, 21, 74, 16]
Agent 1: [61, 81, 28, 88, 59]
Agent 2: [74, 81, 72, 9, 25]
Agent 3: [76, 64, 87, 47, 56]
```

We will allocate the items based on maximizing the individual agent's highest valuations for available items:

1. **Item 3** is the highest valued by Agent 1 with a valuation of 88.
2. **Item 2** is the highest valued by Agent 3 with a valuation of 87.
3. **Item 1** is highly valued by both Agent 1 and Agent 2. We assign it to Agent 2 as Agent 1 already got item 3, and Agent 2 values item 1 at 81.
4. **Item 0** is highly valued by Agent 2 with a valuation of 74, but because Agent 2 has already received item 1, we assign item 0 to Agent 0 with a valuation of 55.
5. **Item 4** is the remaining item. We allocate it to Agent 3, who values it at 56.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects the condition that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing satisfaction with available items.
