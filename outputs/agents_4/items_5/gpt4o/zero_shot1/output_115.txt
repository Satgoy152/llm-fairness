Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  28  53  38  97
1  28  22  37  90  80
2  62  25  91  86  34
3  21  13  39  92   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Initial Maximum Valuations**:
   - Find the highest value each agent has for any item.

2. **Allocate the Highest Value Items**:
   - Assign each agent the item they value the most, provided no two agents have the same highest value for the same item.

3. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   - If two or more agents have the highest value for the same item, allocate the item to the agent who has fewer items assigned so far or who would have the lowest total value without that item.

4. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Allocate any remaining items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent has at least one item.

Applying this strategy to the provided table:

- Agent 0: Values item 4 the most (97).
- Agent 1: Values item 3 the most (90).
- Agent 2: Values item 2 the most (91).
- Agent 3: Values item 3 the most (92) but this conflicts with agent 1.

Let's resolve the conflict for item 3:
- Agent 3 has a slightly higher valuation (92) for item 3 compared to Agent 1 (90), but Agent 1 would have a very low total value without item 3.

Therefore, let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1 and find another suitable item for Agent 3.

Here's a fair allocation:
- Agent 0: Gets item 4 (value 97).
- Agent 1: Gets item 3 (value 90).
- Agent 2: Gets item 2 (value 91).
- Agent 3: Now take item 0 (value 21, since it has some value to Agent 3 and no other agent highly values it).
- The remaining item 1 can be allocated to Agent 1, who has room for one more item.

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their individual valuations given the constraints.
