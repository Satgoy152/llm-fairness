Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8   2  79   1  88
1  65  82  24  21  41
2   1  35  68  34  22
3  20  77  23  85  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will consider maximizing the overall value that agents derive from the items they receive. A common approach is to use a method that takes into account the preferences of each agent and tries to maximize total utility while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's examine the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0 values: 8, 2, 79, 1, 88
- Agent 1 values: 65, 82, 24, 21, 41
- Agent 2 values: 1, 35, 68, 34, 22
- Agent 3 values: 20, 77, 23, 85, 91

We should try to allocate items such that the highest total valuation is achieved while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items (between 0 and the total number of items available).

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (88) and item 2 (79).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (82) and item 0 (65).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (68) and item 3 (34).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (91) and item 3 (85).

Considering these preferences, we can allocate as follows to maximize overall satisfaction:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (highest value for agent 0).
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (highest value for agent 1).
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (relatively high value for agent 2).
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (highest value for agent 3).

This leaves item 0, which has relatively high value for agent 1 compared to others.

Final allocation will be:
- Agent 0 receives item 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has items assigned based on their preferences and maximizes the overall utility given the constraints.
