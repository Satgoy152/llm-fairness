Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  97  18  32  63
1   8  92   1  77  43
2  25  23  91  70   7
3  41  55  83  82  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 55 83 82 74]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Given there are 4 agents and 5 items, one agent will end up with two items. Let's consider the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value for item 1: 97

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value for item 1: 92
   - Second highest value for item 3: 77

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value for item 2: 91

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value for item 3: 82
   - Second highest value for item 4: 74

Considering these values, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (83)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (92)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (91)
- **Agent 3**: Item 3 (82)

Since one agent can receive two items, and Agent 3 has the highest remaining value for item 4, we assign:

- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (74)

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
