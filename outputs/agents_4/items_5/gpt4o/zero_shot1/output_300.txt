Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  60  81  39  38
1  75  46  87  58  54
2  43  63  38   0  22
3  37  39  37  47  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75 46 87 58 54]
 [43 63 38  0 22]
 [37 39 37 47 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the total valuation or ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. We'll try to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly, if possible.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Receives item 2 (Value: 81)
2. **Agent 1:** Receives item 0 (Value: 75)
3. **Agent 2:** Receives item 1 (Value: 63)
4. **Agent 3:** Receives item 4 (Value: 85)
5. **Agent 0:** Receives item 3 (Value: 39)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the values provided.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
