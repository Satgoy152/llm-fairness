Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  34  43  88  36
1  15  96  26  91  51
2  28  85  47  54  43
3  88  72  51  19  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 72 51 19 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

To achieve this, we will consider the values each agent has for the items and try to give each agent the items they value the most while ensuring that all items are distributed fairly.

Let's analyze the table:

Agent 0:
- Values: [17, 34, 43, 88, 36]

Agent 1:
- Values: [15, 96, 26, 91, 51]

Agent 2:
- Values: [28, 85, 47, 54, 43]

Agent 3:
- Values: [88, 72, 51, 19, 38]

From the table, we can see that:

1. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (96).
2. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (88).
3. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (88).
4. Agent 2 values item 1 quite highly as well (85), but since Agent 1 values it more, we should consider other items for Agent 2.
5. Agent 2 values item 2 decently (47).
6. Agent 3 values item 0 highly, but since Agent 0 values item 3 more, we consider item 0 for Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 also values item 4 relatively highly).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item they value reasonably well, with no item left unallocated.

The allocation can be presented in the requested JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

Each agent has received an integer number of items, and all items have been allocated.
