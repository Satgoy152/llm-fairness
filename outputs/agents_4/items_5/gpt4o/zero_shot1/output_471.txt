Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1   7  61  75  30
1   4  63  23  90  29
2  12  48  54  28  44
3  88  82  46  81  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can utilize a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction or total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given that there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the others receive 1 item each. Here's one potential allocation approach based on maximizing valuations:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuations overall and particularly high values for item 0 and item 3. Allocating item 0 and item 3 to agent 3 maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1. Allocating item 1 to agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction with their highest-valued item.

3. **Agent 2** has a fair valuation for item 2 compared to other items. Allocating item 2 to agent 2 ensures they get a reasonable value.

4. **Agent 0** can be allocated item 4, which is the remaining item. This allocation ensures every agent gets at least one item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed among the 4 agents with a focus on maximizing total satisfaction based on their valuations.
