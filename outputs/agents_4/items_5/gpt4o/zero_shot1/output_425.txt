Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  91   2  78  27
1  66  53  10  94   3
2  96  88  67  20  10
3  62  86  72  93   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 53 10 94  3]
 [96 88 67 20 10]
 [62 86 72 93  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's consider the highest valuation each agent has for the items and allocate accordingly.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest value: Item 1 (91)

- Agent 1:
  - Highest value: Item 3 (94)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest value: Item 0 (96)

- Agent 3:
  - Highest value: Item 3 (93)

Given these values, we can try to allocate the items to maximize the satisfaction (total value) for each agent while ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Let's make the allocations based on maximizing each agent's high-value preferences:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value for Item 0 is by Agent 2).
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Item 1 is by Agent 0).
3. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Item 3 is by Agent 1).
4. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3 (next highest value for an unallocated item is by Agent 3 for Item 2).
5. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest value for an unallocated item is by Agent 0 for Item 4).

Now we have an allocation that respects each agent's highest available preferences and ensures all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their valuations under the constraint of allocating all items and each agent receiving integers of items.
