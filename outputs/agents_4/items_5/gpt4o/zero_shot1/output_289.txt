Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  42   9  27  33
1  76  43  25  49  87
2  96  94  53  88  95
3  59  59  93  73  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that every item is assigned to exactly one agent and each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations provided, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

Let's consider each agent's highest valuation items and allocate them accordingly:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (45).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 (87).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (53).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuations for items 2 and 3, but since item 2 is already taken, we allocate item 3 to agent 3 (73).

Now, we have allocated four items: 0, 2, 3, and 4. We have one item left to allocate, which is item 1.

Since item 1 has not been allocated and agent 2 has already received item 2, we can allocate item 1 to agent 0, who also has a significant valuation for it (42), and it balances their allocation.

Now, every agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
