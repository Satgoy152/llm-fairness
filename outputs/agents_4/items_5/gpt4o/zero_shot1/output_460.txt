Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  53  69  54  58
1  93  78  89  11  53
2   3  21   8  11  44
3  88  23  55  44  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents. This can be achieved by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. However, we must ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of allocated items does not exceed 5.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **List all items with their respective values for each agent.**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 (12), Agent 1 (93), Agent 2 (3), Agent 3 (88)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (53), Agent 1 (78), Agent 2 (21), Agent 3 (23)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (69), Agent 1 (89), Agent 2 (8), Agent 3 (55)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (54), Agent 1 (11), Agent 2 (11), Agent 3 (44)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (58), Agent 1 (53), Agent 2 (44), Agent 3 (46)

2. **Allocate each item to the agent that values it the most.**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (93)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (78)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (89)
   - Item 3: Agent 3 (44)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (58)

3. **Check allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2
   - Agent 2: No items
   - Agent 3: Item 3

4. **Ensure only 5 items are allocated in total.**

Now, presenting the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed considering the highest value for each item and meets the condition of allocating exactly 5 items.
