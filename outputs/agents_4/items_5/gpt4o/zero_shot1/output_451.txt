Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59   6  84   4  87
1  40  74  80   7  44
2  52  82  17  32   4
3  26  67  33  90  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 82 17 32  4]
 [26 67 33 90 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will aim to allocate the items such that the overall value assigned is balanced and no agent is disproportionately favored.

Let's review the data:

- Agent 0 values: [59, 6, 84, 4, 87]
- Agent 1 values: [40, 74, 80, 7, 44]
- Agent 2 values: [52, 82, 17, 32, 4]
- Agent 3 values: [26, 67, 33, 90, 40]

We'll allocate based on the highest value an agent assigns to an item, while trying to distribute the items as evenly as possible:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 59.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 82.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
4. Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 90.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 87.

Now, let's adjust to ensure all agents get a fair allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it at 80.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences while distributing items fairly. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
