Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  85  33  32  16
1  44  82  25  39  28
2  64  86  35  93  87
3   1  74   5  25  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, while also maximizing the overall satisfaction. A common approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum weighted matching" in a bipartite graph where agents and items are nodes.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (93), so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 2** also has a high valuation for item 1 (86), but let's see if others have higher relative valuations.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (85), so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** has a reasonable valuation for item 0 (44), so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
5. **Agent 3** should get at least one item, and given their highest valuation is for item 4 (59), allocate item 4 to agent 3.
6. Lastly, we need to allocate item 2. The highest remaining valuation for item 2 is by agent 2 (35), but agent 1 also values item 2 (25). However, since agent 2 already has item 3 (93), we'll allocate item 2 to agent 1 to balance the distribution and ensure fair satisfaction.

Based on the above strategy, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
