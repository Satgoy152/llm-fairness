Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  20  92  66  83
1  50  75  82  68  38
2  75  12   2  54  34
3  85  77  74  36  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62 20 92 66 83]
 [50 75 82 68 38]
 [75 12  2 54 34]
 [85 77 74 36 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation or ensure equitable distribution. One common method is using a "greedy" algorithm where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, we should also ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, as long as it does not significantly decrease the overall valuation.

Let's review the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  20  92  66  83
1  50  75  82  68  38
2  75  12   2  54  34
3  85  77  74  36  81
```

We'll assign items to maximize overall satisfaction:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 85.
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 77.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 68.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 83.

Now let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
