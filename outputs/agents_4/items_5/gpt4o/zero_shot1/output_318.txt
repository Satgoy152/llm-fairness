Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  43   7  12  71
1  25  78  38  33  30
2  26  43  80  53  20
3   7  82  99  95  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. A common approach is to use the Hungarian algorithm or other optimization techniques to ensure a fair distribution. Here, we'll manually assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent has an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  43   7  12  71
1  25  78  38  33  30
2  26  43  80  53  20
3   7  82  99  95  26
```

We can start by allocating items to agents based on their maximum valuations in a way that ensures no more than one item is assigned to more than one agent, and each agent gets an integer number of items:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (72) and item 4 (71). Let's assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 1 (78). Let's assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2 (80). Let's assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3 (95). Let's assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Now, we have item 4 left. Agent 0 also values item 4 highly, so let's assign item 4 to Agent 0.

With this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation is fair given the provided valuations, as it maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences.
