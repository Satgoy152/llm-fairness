Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  37  64  31   1
1  97  48  67  73   4
2  39  17  64  75  40
3   5  55  57  97   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common method is to try to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. However, with only 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will end up with one item.

Let's evaluate a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (92).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (97), but since it's already given to agent 0, the next highest is item 3 (73).
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (75), but since it's already given to agent 1, the next highest is item 2 (64).
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (97), but since it's already given to agent 1, the next highest is item 1 (55).

Let's allocate based on these preferences:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 92)
- Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 73)
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 64)
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (value 55)

Item 4 has the lowest valuations across the board, and it can be given to any agent who hasn't received an item. In this allocation, Agent 3 gets item 4 as well, as they have the lowest valuation priority for remaining items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed with the aim to maximize the individual agents' valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
