Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  64  61  65  98
1  28  60  75  94  83
2  27  65  56  95  93
3  15  55  78   6  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and only 5 items are allocated in total, we can use an approach that maximizes the total valuation by matching items with agents that value them the most. Here's a possible allocation:

1. First, identify the item with the highest value for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (98).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (94).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (95), but since Agent 1 also values item 3 highly, we can give Agent 2 their second-highest valued item, which is item 4 (93).
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the most (78).

2. Resolve conflicting items by checking other high-value items for agents:
   - Agent 0 can take item 4.
   - Agent 1 can take item 3.
   - Agent 2 can take item 1, which is their next highest valued item (65).
   - Agent 3 can take item 2.

3. Allocate the remaining item (0) to the agent with the least total value so far:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, who still has no items assigned.

Using this method, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent has been considered in the distribution process, matching items based on their highest valuations to the extent possible.
