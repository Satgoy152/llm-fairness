Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20   2  19  85  30
1  21  53  36  57  43
2  44   2  95  46  29
3  56  24   9  66  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 53 36 57 43]
 [44  2 95 46 29]
 [56 24  9 66 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We will consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to distribute the items so that each agent gets at least one item, and the overall allocation is as optimal as possible based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: 20, 2, 19, 85, 30
- Agent 1: 21, 53, 36, 57, 43
- Agent 2: 44, 2, 95, 46, 29
- Agent 3: 56, 24, 9, 66, 15

From this, we can proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 85.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 53.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 95.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 56.

This leaves us with item 4, which needs to be allocated to one of the agents. Based on the remaining valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 at 30.
- Agent 1 values item 4 at 43.
- Agent 2 values item 4 at 29.
- Agent 3 values item 4 at 15.

Therefore, item 4 should be allocated to Agent 1, who values it the highest among those who haven't received their preferred allocations.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
