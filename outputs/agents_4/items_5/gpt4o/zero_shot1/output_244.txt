Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  15  37  35   8
1  91  65  49  76   6
2  45  76  53  78  11
3  32  82  67   2  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[46 15 37 35  8]
 [91 65 49 76  6]
 [45 76 53 78 11]
 [32 82 67  2 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will look for a way to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Since there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive only one item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (46).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (91).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (78).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (82).

Considering these valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (91).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 3, as they value it the highest (82).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (78).

Now, we have two items left to allocate: item 2 and item 4.

4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it the second highest among unassigned items (37).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as they have a remaining spot and value it more than Agent 0 (11 vs 8).

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
