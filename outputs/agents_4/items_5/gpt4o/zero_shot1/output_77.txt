Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  68  17  12  63
1  18  75  88  47  33
2  64  18  14  20  23
3   3  14  17  30  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 75 88 47 33]
 [64 18 14 20 23]
 [ 3 14 17 30 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items and attempt to distribute them such that the overall satisfaction (or total value) is maximized while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 73.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 88.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 64.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 77.

To maximize overall satisfaction:
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 as they value it the highest.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as they value it the highest.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 as they value it the highest.
- Now we have items 1 and 3 remaining.

For item 1:
- Agent 0 values it at 68.
- Agent 1 values it at 75.
- Agent 2 values it at 18.
- Agent 3 values it at 14.

Assign item 1 to Agent 1 as they value it the highest.

For item 3:
- Agent 0 values it at 12.
- Agent 1 values it at 47.
- Agent 2 values it at 20.
- Agent 3 values it at 30.

Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as they value it significantly more than others.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [4]

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4]
}
```
