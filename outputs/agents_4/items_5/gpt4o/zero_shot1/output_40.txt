Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  64  24  88  22
1   8  47  15  48  40
2  69  80  20  86  77
3   0  26  67  63  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations, let's assign the items to the agents by ensuring that each item goes to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:
- Item 0: Agent 2 (69), Agent 0 (45), Agent 1 (8), Agent 3 (0)
- Item 1: Agent 2 (80), Agent 0 (64), Agent 1 (47), Agent 3 (26)
- Item 2: Agent 3 (67), Agent 0 (24), Agent 1 (15), Agent 2 (20)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (88), Agent 2 (86), Agent 3 (63), Agent 1 (48)
- Item 4: Agent 3 (87), Agent 2 (77), Agent 1 (40), Agent 0 (22)

Based on these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:
- Item 0 to Agent 2
- Item 1 to Agent 2
- Item 2 to Agent 3
- Item 3 to Agent 0
- Item 4 to Agent 3

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it most among those who haven't been assigned too many items, while also attempting to fairly distribute the items across the agents.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
