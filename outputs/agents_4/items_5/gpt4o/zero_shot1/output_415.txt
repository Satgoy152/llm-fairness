Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87   9  51  27  56
1  71  32  91  32  51
2  68  45  53  19  71
3  81  70   9  44  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87  9 51 27 56]
 [71 32 91 32 51]
 [68 45 53 19 71]
 [81 70  9 44 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. One approach is to use the "Hungarian algorithm" or similar methods for finding an optimal assignment, but for simplicity, we'll use a greedy strategy that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's go through the items one by one and assign each to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

1. For item 0, the valuations are:  
   - Agent 0: 87  
   - Agent 1: 71  
   - Agent 2: 68  
   - Agent 3: 81  
   Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so assign item 0 to agent 0.

2. For item 1, the valuations are:  
   - Agent 0: 9  
   - Agent 1: 32  
   - Agent 2: 45  
   - Agent 3: 70  
   Agent 3 values item 1 the most, so assign item 1 to agent 3.

3. For item 2, the valuations are:  
   - Agent 0: 51  
   - Agent 1: 91  
   - Agent 2: 53  
   - Agent 3: 9  
   Agent 1 values item 2 the most, so assign item 2 to agent 1.

4. For item 3, the valuations are:  
   - Agent 0: 27  
   - Agent 1: 32  
   - Agent 2: 19  
   - Agent 3: 44  
   Agent 3 values item 3 the most, so assign item 3 to agent 3.

5. For item 4, the valuations are:  
   - Agent 0: 56  
   - Agent 1: 51  
   - Agent 2: 71  
   - Agent 3: 23  
   Agent 2 values item 4 the most, so assign item 4 to agent 2.

Now we have the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
