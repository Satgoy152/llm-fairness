Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  96  75  40  57
1  65  81  78  53  32
2  73  95  61  81  49
3  54  12  27  18  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent given the constraints. Since each agent should receive an integer number of items, and there are only 5 items, each agent will receive at most one or two items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to make the allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations**: Look at the table and identify which agents have the highest valuations for specific items.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuations**: Assign items to agents based on these highest valuations, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated**: Make sure that all 5 items are allocated by re-evaluating assignments if necessary.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 96.
- Agent 1 values item 1 second highest at 81.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 81.
- Agent 3 has generally low valuations, but item 0 is highest at 54.

Based on these observations, the initial assignment could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining items (2 and 4):

- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest after other allocations.
- Agent 2 values item 4 higher than the others.

So, the final allocation could be:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned once, and all agents are considered based on their highest valuations given the constraints. If you have any further questions or need additional adjustments, feel free to ask!
