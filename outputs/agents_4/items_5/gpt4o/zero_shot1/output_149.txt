Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  43   3  35  56
1  98  35  40  70  31
2  54  24  26  33  61
3  24  53  84  67  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [24 53 84 67 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One way to do this is by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze the given matrix and assign each item accordingly:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 85
  - Agent 1 values it at 98 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 54
  - Agent 3 values it at 24
  - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 43
  - Agent 1 values it at 35
  - Agent 2 values it at 24
  - Agent 3 values it at 53 (highest)
  - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 3
  - Agent 1 values it at 40 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 26
  - Agent 3 values it at 84
  - Assign Item 2 to Agent 3

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 35
  - Agent 1 values it at 70 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 33
  - Agent 3 values it at 67
  - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 56
  - Agent 1 values it at 31
  - Agent 2 values it at 61 (highest)
  - Agent 3 values it at 85
  - Assign Item 4 to Agent 3

Now, let's summarize the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most, while respecting the constraint that only 5 items are allocated in total.
