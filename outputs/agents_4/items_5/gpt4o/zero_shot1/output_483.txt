Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  34  82  52  85
1  26  66  62  87  65
2  13  93  23  58   3
3  75  87  70  51  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 66 62 87 65]
 [13 93 23 58  3]
 [75 87 70 51 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One common method is to use a greedy approach, where we assign items to agents who value them the most. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: The valuations are 20, 26, 13, and 75. Agent 3 values it the most, so assign item 0 to agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: The valuations are 34, 66, 93, and 87. Agent 2 values it the most, so assign item 1 to agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: The valuations are 82, 62, 23, and 70. Agent 0 values it the most, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The valuations are 52, 87, 58, and 51. Agent 1 values it the most, so assign item 3 to agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The valuations are 85, 65, 3, and 15. Agent 0 values it the most, so assign item 4 to agent 0.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

These allocations ensure each item is assigned and that each agent receives the items they value highly, given the constraints.
