Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  67  88   1  89
1  71  72  57  25  19
2  56  55  37  51  10
3   0  38  32  55  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. One approach is to assign items in a way that considers each agent's highest preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the table and make the allocations:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is item 4 with a value of 89.
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is item 1 with a value of 72.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is item 0 with a value of 56.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value for Agent 3 is item 4, but since item 4 is already allocated, we look for the next highest value, which is item 3 with a value of 55.

Now, each agent has received one item. We have assigned 4 out of the 5 items, and we should allocate the remaining item to maximize overall satisfaction. The item left is item 2, which hasn't been assigned yet.

5. **Assign remaining item (item 2):**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 88, which is the highest among all agents for this item. 

### Final Allocation:

After considering the best assignment for maximizing each agent's satisfaction, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible.
