Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  49   2  11  53
1  99  99  28  76  19
2  47  61  55  52  69
3  31  19  41   7  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 49  2 11 53]
 [99 99 28 76 19]
 [47 61 55 52 69]
 [31 19 41  7 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's examine the valuations table and attempt to allocate items:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  49   2  11  53
1  99  99  28  76  19
2  47  61  55  52  69
3  31  19  41   7  88
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0.
   - Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4.

2. **Initial Allocations:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (valuation of 99).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (valuation of 99).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (valuation of 76).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (valuation of 88).

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 2 is left. Agent 2 has the highest relative valuation for item 2 (valuation of 55).

### Final Allocations:

Based on the strategy above, the final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
