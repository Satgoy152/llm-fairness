Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  30  23  11  14
1   3  48  91   8  94
2  87  22  73  98  68
3  31  72  81  33  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A fair allocation can be achieved by maximizing the overall satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

To achieve this, we can use a greedy approach where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item where possible. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (87).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (72).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (91).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (98).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (94).

Now, we check if every agent has at least one item. In this allocation, Agent 0 did not receive any items, so we need to adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Revisiting assignments:
- Agent 2 has two items (0 and 3). We can reallocate one item to Agent 0.
- Let's reallocate Item 0 to Agent 0 since they have the second-highest valuation for it.

Revised allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
