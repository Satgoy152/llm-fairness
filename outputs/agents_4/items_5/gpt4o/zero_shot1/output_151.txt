Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  37   2  19  80
1  71  97  98  24  40
2  77  53  49  41  10
3  59  67  10  26  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [59 67 10 26 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. The goal is to optimize allocations based on each agent's valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 58, 37, 2, 19, 80
- Agent 1 values: 71, 97, 98, 24, 40
- Agent 2 values: 77, 53, 49, 41, 10
- Agent 3 values: 59, 67, 10, 26, 57

A fair way to allocate is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's assign each item:

1. Item 0: 
   - Highest value is 77 by Agent 2.

2. Item 1:
   - Highest value is 97 by Agent 1.

3. Item 2:
   - Highest value is 98 by Agent 1.

4. Item 3:
   - Highest value is 41 by Agent 2.

5. Item 4:
   - Highest value is 80 by Agent 0.

Now, let's distribute the items based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 3: No items

Now, let's provide the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of allocated items is 5.
