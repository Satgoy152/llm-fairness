Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  43  31  93  96
1  14  41  62  48  11
2  95  76  14  99  49
3  15   5  45  71  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [15  5 45 71 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 99), as it is the highest value for this item across all agents.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 96), as it is the highest value for this item across all agents.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 95), as it is the highest value for this item across all agents.
4. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 76), as it is the highest value for this item across all agents.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 62), as it is the highest value for this item across all agents.

Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 3],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the highest valuations by the agents.
