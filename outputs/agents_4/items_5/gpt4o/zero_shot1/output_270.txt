Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  16  88  18  52
1  63  37  72  25  17
2  84  51  84  36  73
3  59  34  47  29  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's look at the given valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  16  88  18  52
1  63  37  72  25  17
2  84  51  84  36  73
3  59  34  47  29  87
```

One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent is assigned more than one item before others have received an item. We will iterate over the items to allocate them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction as much as possible given the constraints.

Allocation steps:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is 84 by Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is 51 by Agent 2, but Agent 2 already has an item. The next highest is 37 by Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 88 by Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 36 by Agent 2, but Agent 2 already has an item. The next highest is 29 by Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 87 by Agent 3, but Agent 3 already has an item. The next highest is 73 by Agent 2, but Agent 2 already has an item. The next highest is 52 by Agent 0, but Agent 0 already has an item. The next highest is 17 by Agent 1.

After this allocation, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual satisfaction based on their valuations for the items they receive.
