Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  34  25  11  54
1  30  64  98  50  18
2  38  85  19  40  76
3  31  74  92  38  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 64 98 50 18]
 [38 85 19 40 76]
 [31 74 92 38 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total value or ensuring equitable distribution. Given the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  34  25  11  54
1  30  64  98  50  18
2  38  85  19  40  76
3  31  74  92  38  59
```

We aim to allocate all 5 items to the 4 agents such that each agent is fairly considered. Let's try to assign items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the items, ensuring no two agents receive the same item.

Let's go through the assignment:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (value 98), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 2 highly values item 1 (value 85), so assign item 1 to Agent 2.
3. Agent 3 highly values item 2, but it is already assigned, so we consider the next highest, item 3 (value 38), and assign it to Agent 3.
4. Agent 0 highly values item 4 (value 54), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
5. Items 0 and 3 are still available. Since Agent 1 and Agent 3 have only one item, assign item 0 to Agent 3 (next highest value among remaining items).

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 0 and 3

This ensures each agent gets at least one item and total of exactly 5 items are allocated.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
