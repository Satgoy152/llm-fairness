Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  35  32  29  17
1  86   8  64   0  48
2  80  21  17  47  58
3  57  54  97  89  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[12 35 32 29 17]
 [86  8 64  0 48]
 [80 21 17 47 58]
 [57 54 97 89 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can apply the Maximum Weighted Matching technique, which aims to maximize the total value of the allocation based on the given valuations. Let's break down the allocation process using the provided valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  35  32  29  17
1  86   8  64   0  48
2  80  21  17  47  58
3  57  54  97  89  25
```

We'll aim to assign items such that the total valuation is maximized while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0 (value 86), so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 2 (value 97), so we assign item 2 to agent 3.
3. **Agent 3** also has a high valuation for item 3 (value 89), so we assign item 3 to agent 3.
4. **Agent 2** has a relatively high valuation for item 4 (value 58), so we assign item 4 to agent 2.
5. Lastly, we assign item 1 to **Agent 0**, who has a valuation of 35 for it.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets items according to their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring a fair distribution among the agents.
