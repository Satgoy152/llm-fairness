Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  43  92   7   6
1   9  12  20  23  23
2  15  95  73  39  94
3  23  54  17   9   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations table. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction or value for each agent, while ensuring that each item is allocated to one agent only and each agent can receive zero or more items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocating the items:

1. **Identify the highest value item for each agent:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value 92).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (value 23).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most (value 95).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (value 54).

2. **Allocate items based on the highest values:** 
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate remaining items (0, 3) by considering the next highest values and ensuring fairness:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the second highest (value 77).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the next highest after item 1 (value 39).

4. **Final allocation based on the next best choices that don't overlap:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (since it’s their second highest valued item).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (since it’s their next highest valued item after item 1).

Given these allocations, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all the items are allocated fairly based on the given valuations.
