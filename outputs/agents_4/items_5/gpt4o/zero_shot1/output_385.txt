Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  79  36  90  15
1  11  49  48  62  94
2  80  71  79  80  66
3  12  57  13  59  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 57 13 59 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

First, we compute the total valuation for each possible allocation. We can prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most.

Let's examine the highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (90)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (94)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (80)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (57)

Now, let's assign these high-value items to agents and see if any unassigned items remain:

1. Agent 0 receives Item 3.
2. Agent 1 receives Item 4.
3. Agent 2 receives Item 0.
4. Agent 3 receives Item 1.

One item is left unallocated: Item 2.

To determine where to allocate Item 2, we check which agent values it the most:
- Agent 0 values Item 2 at 36.
- Agent 1 values Item 2 at 48.
- Agent 2 values Item 2 at 79.
- Agent 3 values Item 2 at 13.

Agent 2 values Item 2 the most. Therefore, we allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

Now we have the following allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 3: Item 1

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
