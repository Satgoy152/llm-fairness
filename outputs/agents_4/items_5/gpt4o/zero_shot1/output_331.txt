Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33   6  25  97   2
1  13  53  69  96  23
2  75  69  87   7  86
3  12  20  85  76  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 53 69 96 23]
 [75 69 87  7 86]
 [12 20 85 76 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 with a value of 97.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 with a value of 96, but it's already allocated.
   - The next highest value is item 2 with a value of 69.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 2 with a value of 87, but it's already allocated.
   - The next highest value is item 0 with a value of 75.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 3 is item 2 with a value of 85, but it's already allocated.
   - The next highest value is item 3 with a value of 76, but it's already allocated.
   - The next highest value is item 1 with a value of 20.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Item**:
   - Item 4 is still unallocated.
   - The highest remaining value for item 4 is for Agent 2 with a value of 86.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and the allocations are balanced to maximize each agent's total value.
