Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  45  45  64  37
1  64  48  60  49  70
2  74  11  75  42  71
3  97  97   8  45  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[38 45 45 64 37]
 [64 48 60 49 70]
 [74 11 75 42 71]
 [97 97  8 45 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to assign items based on the highest valuations for each item while ensuring each agent gets approximately an equal number of items. 

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the highest at 97.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the highest at 97.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest at 75.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 64.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 70.

To ensure fairness and that each agent gets a similar number of items, we can assign items in a way that balances the allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 3
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 3
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, maximizing the valuations where possible and dividing the items fairly.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
