Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  94  45  46   9
1   4  79  98  67  28
2  53  58  19  15  65
3  48  94  22  15  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: First, identify the value each agent places on all the items to understand their preferences.

   - Agent 0: 42, 94, 45, 46, 9
   - Agent 1: 4, 79, 98, 67, 28
   - Agent 2: 53, 58, 19, 15, 65
   - Agent 3: 48, 94, 22, 15, 52

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Value Preferences**: We will allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

   - Item 0: Highest value is 53 (Agent 2)
   - Item 1: Highest value is 94 (Agent 0 or 3, let's choose Agent 0)
   - Item 2: Highest value is 98 (Agent 1)
   - Item 3: Highest value is 67 (Agent 1)
   - Item 4: Highest value is 65 (Agent 2)

3. **Check Allocations**: Make sure we have allocated all items and no agent gets more than a fair share.

   - Agent 0: [1]
   - Agent 1: [2, 3]
   - Agent 2: [0, 4]
   - Agent 3: []

4. **Present the Allocations in JSON format**:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their highest value preferences while respecting the constraint of distributing exactly 5 items.
