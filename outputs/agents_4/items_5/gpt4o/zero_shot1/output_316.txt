Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  70  13  31  21
1  80  11  12  99  59
2  42   2  16  27  81
3  46  82  31  46  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [80 11 12 99 59]
 [42  2 16 27 81]
 [46 82 31 46 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations. We'll also ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 5 items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  70  13  31  21
1  80  11  12  99  59
2  42   2  16  27  81
3  46  82  31  46  35
```

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most at 99.
2. **Agent 1** also values item 0 highly at 80.
3. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most at 70.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly at 35.
5. **Agent 2** values item 2 highest at 16.

Based on these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items according to their highest valuations while distributing all 5 items.
