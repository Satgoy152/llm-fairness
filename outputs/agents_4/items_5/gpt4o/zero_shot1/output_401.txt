Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  45  33  80  58
1  88  14  76  16  76
2  96   0  64  86  60
3  81  22  59   8  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 14 76 16 76]
 [96  0 64 86 60]
 [81 22 59  8 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Since there are 4 agents and 5 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the highest value for each item across all agents and allocate the item to the agent with the highest value.
2. Ensure that no agent receives more than the fair share unless it's unavoidable.

Now let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest value is 96 by Agent 2.
- Item 1: Highest value is 45 by Agent 0.
- Item 2: Highest value is 76 by Agent 1.
- Item 3: Highest value is 86 by Agent 2.
- Item 4: Highest value is 76 by Agent 1.

Since Agent 2 and Agent 1 would each receive 2 items according to the highest valuation strategy, and to ensure fairness, we need to balance the allocation so that the sum of values is maximized for each agent.

Considering the constraints:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 5.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
