Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  11  68  91  85
1  69  50  93  70  50
2  54  53   3  48  99
3  29  50  69  60  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the preferences of each agent for the items. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can do it:

1. For each item, identify which agent values it the most.
2. Allocate the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that exactly 5 items are allocated in total.

Following these steps:

- Item 0: The highest value is 69 by Agent 1.
- Item 1: The highest value is 53 by Agent 2.
- Item 2: The highest value is 93 by Agent 1.
- Item 3: The highest value is 91 by Agent 0.
- Item 4: The highest value is 99 by Agent 2.

Based on the above valuation analysis, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 3 gets no items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": []
}
```
