Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  27  95  54  11
1  88  50  43  96  67
2  68  81  50  52  65
3  29  51  52  12  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 27 95 54 11]
 [88 50 43 96 67]
 [68 81 50 52 65]
 [29 51 52 12 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value received by all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  27  95  54  11
1  88  50  43  96  67
2  68  81  50  52  65
3  29  51  52  12  63
```

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is Item 0 with a value of 96. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is Item 3 with a value of 96. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is Item 1 with a value of 81. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is Item 4 with a value of 63. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining item**: The only remaining item is Item 2. We choose an agent for this item based on the highest remaining value:
   - Agent 0's value for Item 2: 95
   - Agent 1's value for Item 2: 43
   - Agent 2's value for Item 2: 50
   - Agent 3's value for Item 2: 52

   The highest value for Item 2 among the remaining choices is 95 by Agent 0. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to an agent, maximizes the total value for each agent, and respects the requirement that each agent receives an integer number of items.
