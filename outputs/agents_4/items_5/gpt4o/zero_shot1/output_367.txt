Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  61  94  30  84
1  76  17  67   5  27
2  18  40  49  68  25
3  65  12  76  55  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [76 17 67  5 27]
 [18 40 49 68 25]
 [65 12 76 55 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent assigns to any item.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than their fair share (i.e., no agent receives more than one item more than any other agent).

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 76.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 61.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 94.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 68.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the highest at 87.

The allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [4]

So the JSON format allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
