Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  76  97  44  40
1  51  79  14   1  40
2  88  52  53  81  90
3  28  27  28  33  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of the 5 items among the 4 agents, we can aim to maximize the total utility each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. However, since we need to distribute items fairly among all agents, we should focus on the optimal distribution across all agents.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 1, so we give item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 4, so we give item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has relatively low values overall, but we can give them item 3 as it has one of their higher values.

This leaves items 0 and 2, which have high values for agent 0. We give items 0 and 2 to agent 0.

This way, each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution respects the high values each agent has for the items they receive.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
