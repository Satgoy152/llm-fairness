Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  97  66  62  63
1  67  41  60  89  51
2  70  59  69  94  23
3  53  75  82  48  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent's total valuation for their allocated items is balanced relative to the others. This involves considering each agent's valuation for each item and trying to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is roughly equal.

Here's a possible allocation that attempts to balance the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 1
   - Valuation: 97

2. **Agent 1**: Item 3
   - Valuation: 89

3. **Agent 2**: Item 0
   - Valuation: 70

4. **Agent 3**: Items 2 and 4
   - Valuation: 82 + 61 = 143

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent has at least one item or is considered in the allocation process.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
