Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  99  48  37  44
1  92  68  50  69  87
2  10  70  35  74  37
3  79  87  43  70  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [79 87 43 70 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy method that aims to maximize the total value of items allocated to each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on maximizing their total value, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's compute the sum of valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 44 + 99 + 48 + 37 + 44 = 272
- Agent 1: 92 + 68 + 50 + 69 + 87 = 366
- Agent 2: 10 + 70 + 35 + 74 + 37 = 226
- Agent 3: 79 + 87 + 43 + 70 + 57 = 336

Now, we will allocate items based on maximizing individual agent values per item:

1. Agent 1 values item 0 highly (92), item 4 (87), and item 3 (69).
2. Agent 0 values item 1 highly (99).
3. Agent 3 values item 2 highly (43).
4. Agent 2 will not receive any items due to its lower valuation compared to others.

Here's an allocation based on the above logic:

- Agent 1 gets items [0, 4].
- Agent 0 gets item [1].
- Agent 3 gets item [2].
- Agent 1 gets item [3].

This ensures all items are distributed. Now, here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their highest-valued items.
