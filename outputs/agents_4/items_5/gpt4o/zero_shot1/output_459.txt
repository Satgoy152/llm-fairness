Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  91  75  35  39
1   7  65   6  18  51
2  84  80  53  47  62
3  18  43  99  14   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 65  6 18 51]
 [84 80 53 47 62]
 [18 43 99 14  8]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items to agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Since there are 5 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally get at least 1 item, but due to the constraint, one agent will get 2 items while the others get 1 item each.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing the valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuation is for item 1 (91).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 4 (51).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 0 (84).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuation is for item 2 (99).

Now, all agents have received 1 item each. We need to allocate the remaining item 3.

- **Item 3** has the highest remaining valuation for Agent 2 (47).

Therefore, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total allocation of items is 5.
