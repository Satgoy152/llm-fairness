Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  28  18  44  82
1  46  74  76  12  26
2  49  66  73  64  58
3  86   8  45  47  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 75
   - Agent 1 values it at 46
   - Agent 2 values it at 49
   - Agent 3 values it at 86 (highest valuation)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 3.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 28
   - Agent 1 values it at 74 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2 values it at 66
   - Agent 3 values it at 8
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 18
   - Agent 1 values it at 76 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2 values it at 73
   - Agent 3 values it at 45
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 44 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 1 values it at 12
   - Agent 2 values it at 64
   - Agent 3 values it at 47
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 82 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 1 values it at 26
   - Agent 2 values it at 58
   - Agent 3 values it at 25
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, given the constraints.
