Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  45  35  47   2
1  37  48  18  51  52
2  36  99   1  19   9
3  81  36  89  89  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 45 35 47  2]
 [37 48 18 51 52]
 [36 99  1 19  9]
 [81 36 89 89 89]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuations. Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  45  35  47   2
1  37  48  18  51  52
2  36  99   1  19   9
3  81  36  89  89  89
```

Let's approach this problem by trying to maximize the total valuation each agent receives:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for items 2 and 3.

However, each agent should get an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated. 

Let's allocate based on the above valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2.
4. Assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. Assign item 3 to agent 3.

Now, we have:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 3.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed such that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while making sure each agent gets an integer number of items.
