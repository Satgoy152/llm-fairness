Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  37  11  15  15
1  98  24  19  22  76
2  31  32  91  26  76
3  95  55  74  77  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 24 19 22 76]
 [31 32 91 26 76]
 [95 55 74 77 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to assign items based on the highest value each agent places on them. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (37)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (98)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (91)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest value items: Item 4 (86), Item 3 (77)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent their most valued item(s) and ensures all items are allocated.
