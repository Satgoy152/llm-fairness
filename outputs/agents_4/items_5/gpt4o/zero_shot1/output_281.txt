Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15   5  63  55  35
1  38  61  86  97  77
2  55   5  96  65  50
3  24  12  59   0  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll try to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated. Below is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has relatively low valuations compared to others, so they might not receive any item.
- Agent 1 values item 3 (97) the highest compared to others, so they should get item 3.
- Agent 2 values item 2 (96) the most, so they should get item 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 (57) the most, so they should get item 4.
- This leaves items 0 and 1, which can be allocated based on remaining values.

Let's allocate the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction:
- Item 0 has the highest value (55) for agent 2 among the remaining options.
- Item 1 has the highest value (61) for agent 1 among the remaining options.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation distributes the items while considering the agents' valuations and ensuring all items are allocated.
