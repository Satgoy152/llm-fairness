Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  27  35  67   6
1  18   0  88  14  92
2  73  66  15  53  34
3  25  56  38  27  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method such as maximizing the total valuation or ensuring each agent gets their most valued items within a reasonable distribution. In this case, I'll attempt to distribute the items by considering each agent's high valuation items and ensuring a fair distribution.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 3.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 0.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 1.

After assigning these, we have one item left, which is item 2. Agent 1 values item 2 highly, so we'll allocate it to them:

- Agent 0: item 3
- Agent 1: items 4, 2
- Agent 2: item 0
- Agent 3: item 1

This distribution considers the highest value each agent has for a unique item and allocates the remaining item to an agent with a relatively high valuation for it.

Now, I'll present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```
