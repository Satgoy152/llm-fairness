Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  71  78  89  39
1  96  83  71  76  31
2  61  26  93  68  13
3  79  73  70  65  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[23 71 78 89 39]
 [96 83 71 76 31]
 [61 26 93 68 13]
 [79 73 70 65 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing the total valuation, we should consider the preferences of each agent for the items. We can use a method such as the "maximum weighted matching" to assign items to agents based on the highest value each agent places on the items. Here's how the allocation could be approached:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value is for item 3 (89).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value is for item 0 (96).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is for item 2 (93).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value is for item 4 (91).

Now we have allocated 4 items: 0, 2, 3, and 4. Only item 1 is left to be allocated.

5. **Item 1**:
   - Remaining agents' valuations: 
     - Agent 0: 71
     - Agent 1: 83
     - Agent 2: 26
     - Agent 3: 73
   - Highest value for item 1 is for Agent 1 (83).

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
