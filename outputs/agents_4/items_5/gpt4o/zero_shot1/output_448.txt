Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  51   2  23  43
1  19   9  89  41  67
2  12  81  87  79  52
3  91  40  53  19  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are distributed. We will use a strategy similar to solving an assignment problem, where we aim to maximize the total value across all agents.

Let's evaluate the situation:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 50
- Item 1: 51
- Item 2: 2
- Item 3: 23
- Item 4: 43

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 19
- Item 1: 9
- Item 2: 89
- Item 3: 41
- Item 4: 67

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 12
- Item 1: 81
- Item 2: 87
- Item 3: 79
- Item 4: 52

Agent 3:
- Item 0: 91
- Item 1: 40
- Item 2: 53
- Item 3: 19
- Item 4: 33

A potential allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's consider each item:

- Item 0: Highest value is 91 by Agent 3
- Item 1: Highest value is 81 by Agent 2
- Item 2: Highest value is 89 by Agent 1
- Item 3: Highest value is 79 by Agent 2
- Item 4: Highest value is 67 by Agent 1

However, since Agent 2 and Agent 1 already have high-value items, we'll need to adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item and to maintain fairness. Let's make a fair distribution with high total valuation:

- Item 0 goes to Agent 3
- Item 1 goes to Agent 2
- Item 2 goes to Agent 1
- Item 3 goes to Agent 0
- Item 4 goes to Agent 1

Now, let's write the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```
