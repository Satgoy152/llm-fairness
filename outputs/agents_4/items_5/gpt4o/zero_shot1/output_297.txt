Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  30  87  68  92
1  72  45  31  22  32
2  52  54  93  22  52
3  79  55  14  17  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 30 87 68 92]
 [72 45 31 22 32]
 [52 54 93 22 52]
 [79 55 14 17 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction by assigning each item to the agent who values it most. Given the valuations, we'll assign the items as follows:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 72, Agent 2 at 52, and Agent 3 at 79.
   - Assign to Agent 3 (highest valuation: 79).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 at 45, Agent 2 at 54, and Agent 3 at 55.
   - Assign to Agent 3 (highest valuation: 55).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 at 31, Agent 2 at 93, and Agent 3 at 14.
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation: 93).

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 at 22, Agent 2 at 22, and Agent 3 at 17.
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 68).

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 at 32, Agent 2 at 52, and Agent 3 at 48.
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 92).

Now, we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.
