Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  90   0  20  29
1  59  65  27  43  92
2  12  64  80  74  34
3  29  55  79  73  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to distribute the items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's take a look at the valuations and make a decision:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (90)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (55)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (92)
   - Second highest: Item 1 (65)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (80)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (74)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (79)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (73)

A potential fair allocation could be based on assigning each agent their highest or second-highest valued item while ensuring no items are double-allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for Agent 2)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 (second-highest valuation for Agent 3)

This leaves Item 0 unassigned. We could allocate it to Agent 0 since they have the second-highest interest in it.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them items they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed.
