Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71   5  82  78  70
1  14  75   0  51  69
2   2  27  23   1  22
3  30  60  71   1  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. There are 4 agents and 5 items, so one agent will inevitably receive only one item or none. Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (82), 3 (78), 0 (71)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (75), 4 (69), 3 (51)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (27), 2 (23), 4 (22)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (since item 1 and 2 are already allocated).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 4 (89), 2 (71), 1 (60)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (since item 4 is already allocated).

At this point, items 0, 1, 2, and 4 are allocated. Only item 3 remains unallocated.

5. **Allocate the remaining item (3):** 
   - Highest remaining value for item 3 is for Agent 0 (78).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

Now, let's compile the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
