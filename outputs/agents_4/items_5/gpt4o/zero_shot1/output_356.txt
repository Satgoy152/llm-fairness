Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  24  38  69  70
1  76  28  87  67  60
2  54  41  65  94  39
3  25  57  10  89  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [76 28 87 67 60]
 [54 41 65 94 39]
 [25 57 10 89 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5. We can aim to maximize the total valuation by each agent, considering the given valuations.

First, let's analyze the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  24  38  69  70
1  76  28  87  67  60
2  54  41  65  94  39
3  25  57  10  89  90
```

We can assign each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's go through the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most (76).
- **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most (57).
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most (87).
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most (94).
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most (90).

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (74) instead of Agent 1 because Agent 1 can get another high-value item.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 3 (57) as planned.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (87) as planned.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (94) as planned.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 (90) as planned.

After these assignments, each agent has at least one item. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and items are assigned based on the highest valuations while meeting the criteria given.
