Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  22  85  88   0
1  69  77  73  62  99
2  56  13  39  74  80
3   5  91  46  97  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives for the items they are allocated. One common approach to solve this is to use the Hungarian algorithm or similar optimal assignment strategies. However, given the small size of the problem, we can manually compute a fair allocation by considering the valuations.

Let's break down the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively balanced low valuations across items but highest for item 4.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 1 and 3.

To ensure fairness, we should try to allocate the items such that agents receive items they value highly. By reviewing the valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- Assign **item 3** to **Agent 0** (value 88).
- Assign **item 4** to **Agent 1** (value 99), since Agent 1 values item 4 the most compared to others.
- Assign **item 0** to **Agent 2** (value 56).
- Assign **item 1** to **Agent 3** (value 91).
- Assign **item 2** to **Agent 0** (value 85), since Agent 0 values items 2 and 3 highly.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets high-value items relative to their individual preferences. Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```
