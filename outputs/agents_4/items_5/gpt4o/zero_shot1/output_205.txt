Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  31  26  83  57
1  23   8  54  64  88
2  46  34  11  89  50
3   5  82  94  82  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item or that the distribution is reasonably fair based on the given valuation matrix. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Maximize Valuation:** We'll try to allocate items to agents such that the sum of their valuations is maximized.
2. **Ensure Fair Distribution:** Try to distribute items in a way that does not leave any agent without an item unless it's unavoidable due to higher valuations by others.

Let's analyze the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 62     | 31     | 26     | 83     | 57     |
| 1     | 23     | 8      | 54     | 64     | 88     |
| 2     | 46     | 34     | 11     | 89     | 50     |
| 3     | 5      | 82     | 94     | 82     | 95     |

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values this the highest at 89. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values this the highest at 95. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.
- **Item 2**: Agent 3 values this the highest at 94. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this the highest at 62. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 3 values this the highest at 82, but since Agent 3 already has two items, we can allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 who values it at 31.

### Final Allocation:

Based on the above reasoning, here's how the items can be allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total valuation is quite high and each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.
