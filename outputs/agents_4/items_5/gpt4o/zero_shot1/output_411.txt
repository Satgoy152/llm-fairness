Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  17  86  61  38
1  48  32  65  56  92
2  20  24  17  63   8
3   9  12  46  38  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [48 32 65 56 92]
 [20 24 17 63  8]
 [ 9 12 46 38 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [21, 17, 86, 61, 38]
   - Highest value: Item 2 (86)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [48, 32, 65, 56, 92]
   - Highest value: Item 4 (92)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [20, 24, 17, 63, 8]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (63)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: [9, 12, 46, 38, 49]
   - Highest value: Item 4 (49)

By examining the highest values:

- **Item 2** can go to Agent 0.
- **Item 4** can go to Agent 1 (since they value it the most).
- **Item 3** can go to Agent 2.
- **Item 0** can go to Agent 1 (second highest value after Item 4).
- **Item 1** can go to Agent 3.

This allocation maximizes the happiness of each agent based on their highest valuations for the items they receive. Now let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
