Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2   5  44  82  15
1  88  54  24  77  82
2  24  45   2  55   9
3  81  29  85  33  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. The goal is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 5 items allocated.

Let's examine each item and determine which agent values it the most:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0: 2
   - Agent 1: 88 (highest value)
   - Agent 2: 24
   - Agent 3: 81

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 5
   - Agent 1: 54 (highest value)
   - Agent 2: 45
   - Agent 3: 29

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 44
   - Agent 1: 24
   - Agent 2: 2
   - Agent 3: 85 (highest value)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 82 (highest value)
   - Agent 1: 77
   - Agent 2: 55
   - Agent 3: 33

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0: 15
   - Agent 1: 82 (highest value)
   - Agent 2: 9
   - Agent 3: 21

Based on these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:
- Item 0 goes to Agent 1
- Item 1 goes to Agent 1
- Item 2 goes to Agent 3
- Item 3 goes to Agent 0
- Item 4 goes to Agent 1

Now let's organize these allocations into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is 5.
