Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  49  68  31   4
1  93   0  92  55  33
2  67  20  99  28  50
3  18  65  94   3  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total sum of valuations across all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One method to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, thereby maximizing satisfaction.

Let's go through the items one by one and assign each to the agent who values it the most:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 12
  - Agent 1 values it at 93
  - Agent 2 values it at 67
  - Agent 3 values it at 18
  - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value: 93)

- **Item 1**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 49
  - Agent 1 values it at 0
  - Agent 2 values it at 20
  - Agent 3 values it at 65
  - **Assign to Agent 3** (highest value: 65)

- **Item 2**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 68
  - Agent 1 values it at 92
  - Agent 2 values it at 99
  - Agent 3 values it at 94
  - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value: 99)

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 31
  - Agent 1 values it at 55
  - Agent 2 values it at 28
  - Agent 3 values it at 3
  - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value: 55)

- **Item 4**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 4
  - Agent 1 values it at 33
  - Agent 2 values it at 50
  - Agent 3 values it at 35
  - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value: 50)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, thus maximizing total satisfaction.
