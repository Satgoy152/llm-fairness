Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  73  98  27  11
1  70  19  71  77  43
2  90  11  17  45  91
3  89  14  21  48  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[34 73 98 27 11]
 [70 19 71 77 43]
 [90 11 17 45 91]
 [89 14 21 48 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method like maximizing the total value of items allocated to all agents or ensuring each agent gets at least one item based on their highest valuation. Here's one approach to the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the highest (value of 98).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the highest (value of 77).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest (value of 91).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the highest (value of 89).

Now, we have allocated four items, and we need to allocate the fifth item. We can choose based on maximizing the remaining value:

- Agent 0 has already received item 2.
- Agent 1 has already received item 3.
- Agent 2 has already received item 4.
- Agent 3 has already received item 0.

The remaining item is item 1. The highest remaining valuation for item 1 is by Agent 0 (value of 73). Thus, we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
