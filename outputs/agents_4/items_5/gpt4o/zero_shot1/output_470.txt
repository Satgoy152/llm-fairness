Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64   1  94  83  14
1  61  89  40  31  63
2  36  80  44  54  93
3  28  93  92  82  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[64  1 94 83 14]
 [61 89 40 31 63]
 [36 80 44 54 93]
 [28 93 92 82 10]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total valuation for each agent. A possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's start by considering the highest valuations for each item and allocate them accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is 64 by Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is 93 by Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 94 by Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 83 by Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 93 by Agent 2.

With these allocations, Agent 0 would receive three items, which is not fair because we need to allocate the items such that no agent receives more than one item than another agent.

To balance the allocation, we can use the following approach:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

This way, each agent gets one item, except for Agent 0, who gets two items, which is a reasonable balance.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents, considering their valuations.
