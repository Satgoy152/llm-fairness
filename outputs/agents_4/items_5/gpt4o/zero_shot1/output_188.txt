Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30   8   0  88  81
1  12   7  71   3  22
2  13   0  15  21   6
3  55  37  56  12  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [55 37 56 12 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation of the items for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. We will approach this by assigning items to the agents who value them most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with a roughly equal number of items.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values item 0 the most (55).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values item 1 the most (37).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most (71).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 the most (88).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 the most (81).

Based on this analysis, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, which they value highly.
- Agent 2 does not receive any item due to their generally low valuations compared to others.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 1, which they value more than other agents. 

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.
