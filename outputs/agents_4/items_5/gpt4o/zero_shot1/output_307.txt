Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  80   3  21  15
1  78  55  86   8  56
2  77  19   5  49  72
3  69  64  42   4  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [69 64 42  4 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are: Item 0 (92), Item 1 (80).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are: Item 2 (86), Item 0 (78).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are: Item 4 (72), Item 3 (49).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest value items for Agent 3 are: Item 0 (69), Item 1 (64).
   - Item 0 is already allocated, so allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Item (Item 3):**
   - Among unallocated items, Item 3 is left.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2, as they have the second highest preference for it.

Based on this allocation strategy, here's the JSON format with the items allocated to each agent:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item based on their preferences as much as possible.
