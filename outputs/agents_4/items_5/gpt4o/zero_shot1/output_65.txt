Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18   0  85  78  89
1  84  39  42  85  23
2  65  27  67  13   6
3  72  31  11  81  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items, and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or fairness in the distribution. One approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here is a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 84.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 values it at 39, Agent 2 values it at 27, and Agent 3 values it at 31. Agent 1 gets it since they value it the highest among agents who can still receive items.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 85.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 values it at 85, Agent 2 values it at 13, and Agent 3 values it at 81. Assign to Agent 1 since they have the highest valuation.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest at 89.

Given these considerations, the allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets no items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": []
}
```
