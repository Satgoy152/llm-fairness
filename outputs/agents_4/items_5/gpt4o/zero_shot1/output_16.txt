Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  76  69  11  23
1   3  13  64  89  64
2  11  67   6  17  94
3  83  97  70  37   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 13 64 89 64]
 [11 67  6 17 94]
 [83 97 70 37  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here is one approach for allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (76)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (89)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (94)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (97), but already taken by Agent 0. So next highest available: Item 0 (83)

At this point, Agent 3 has not received an item yet and only Item 2 is left unallocated. Despite Agent 3 having a higher valuation for Item 0, it belongs to the same agent. So we will allocate Item 2 to Agent 3 to ensure all agents have at least one item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.
