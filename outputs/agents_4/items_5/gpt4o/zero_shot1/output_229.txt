Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  77   3  29  97
1  93  58  81  99  97
2  46  49  16  36  55
3  56  46   4  76   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, one common approach is to maximize the total value of the items assigned to each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is a possible allocation for the agents and items based on the provided valuations:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 4, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 3 and 4, but since item 4 is already allocated, we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has lower valuations overall, but item 1 is the highest valued item for agent 2, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3, but since item 3 is already allocated, we allocate item 0 to agent 3.

This leaves item 2 unallocated, which has relatively low valuations across all agents, so we can allocate it to agent 1 who has one of the higher valuations for it, ensuring a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```
