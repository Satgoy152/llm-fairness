Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  95  55  16  62
1  12  71  98  11  41
2  99  13  93  74  96
3  77  69  84  10  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [77 69 84 10 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. We can use a method that assigns items to the agent who values them the most in a way that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (value = 99).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (value = 98).
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (value = 95).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (value = 95).
5. **Agent 2** also values item 3 (value = 74).

Now let's see the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item while considering the highest valuations.
