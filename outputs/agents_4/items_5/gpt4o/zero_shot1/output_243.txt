Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  32  24  94  90
1  75  91  46  42  31
2  12   3  69  73  74
3  36  27   5  36  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 32 24 94 90]
 [75 91 46 42 31]
 [12  3 69 73 74]
 [36 27  5 36 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation by assigning items to agents based on who values them the most. This is a common approach in combinatorial allocation problems.

Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The valuations are as follows:
   - Agent 0: 78
   - Agent 1: 75
   - Agent 2: 12
   - Agent 3: 36
   The highest valuation is by Agent 0, so assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: The valuations are as follows:
   - Agent 0: 32
   - Agent 1: 91
   - Agent 2: 3
   - Agent 3: 27
   The highest valuation is by Agent 1, so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: The valuations are as follows:
   - Agent 0: 24
   - Agent 1: 46
   - Agent 2: 69
   - Agent 3: 5
   The highest valuation is by Agent 2, so assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: The valuations are as follows:
   - Agent 0: 94
   - Agent 1: 42
   - Agent 2: 73
   - Agent 3: 36
   The highest valuation is by Agent 0, so assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: The valuations are as follows:
   - Agent 0: 90
   - Agent 1: 31
   - Agent 2: 74
   - Agent 3: 32
   The highest valuation is by Agent 0, but since Agent 0 already has two items, let's consider Agent 2, who has the next highest valuation. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": []
}
```
