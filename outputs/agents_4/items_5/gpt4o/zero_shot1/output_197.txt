Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  52  47  99  66
1  91  54  61  97  86
2  40  95  89   5  15
3  14  92  71  17  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that each agent ends up with one item, given there are 4 agents and 5 items. This situation is a classical example of the "assignment problem," which can be solved using combinatorial optimization algorithms like the Hungarian method. However, in this simplified case with only 4 agents and 5 items, we can manually find a suitable allocation.

Let's first consider the highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 3 at 99 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 91 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 95 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 1 at 92 the most.

Our goal is to allocate one item per agent while trying to maximize individual allocations and ensuring fairness. Let's try to find a reasonable allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (highest valuation 99).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (highest valuation 91).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (next highest available valuation 89, since item 1 is contested).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (next highest available valuation 92).

Now, all agents have one item, but we have one more item (item 4) left to allocate. Since none of the agents has item 4 at their highest valuation, we need to allocate it to someone who doesnâ€™t have their highest choice:

- Agent 0: item 4 value = 66
- Agent 1: item 4 value = 86
- Agent 2: item 4 value = 15
- Agent 3: item 4 value = 32

Agent 1 values item 4 highest among the remaining agents. Allocating item 4 to agent 1 balances the allocation better.

With these considerations, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
