Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16   8  76  22  79
1  76  60  28  96  16
2  87  49  59  79  61
3  98  21   2  42  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. This involves examining each agent's valuation for each item and distributing the items in a manner that seeks to maximize overall satisfaction. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Valuations: [16, 8, 76, 22, 79]
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (79).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: [76, 60, 28, 96, 16]
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (96).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [87, 49, 59, 79, 61]
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (87).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Valuations: [98, 21, 2, 42, 88]
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (98), but since item 0 is already allocated to agent 2, we consider the next highest valuation which is item 4 (88).

Let's allocate based on the highest available valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 4.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1 and item 2 (next highest available valuations).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation seeks to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving each their highest valued available item(s) and ensuring all items are distributed.
