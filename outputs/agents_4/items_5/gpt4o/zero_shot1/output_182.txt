Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  60  59  38  40
1   7  47  72  18  59
2  39  60  37  30  24
3   3  20  78  36   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[24 60 59 38 40]
 [ 7 47 72 18 59]
 [39 60 37 30 24]
 [ 3 20 78 36  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total satisfaction, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than two items since there are only 5 items and 4 agents.

Here's how we can allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 3, as they have the highest value of 78 for that item.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they have a high value of 60 for that item.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as they have a value of 24 for that item and it is the highest among remaining unassigned items for agent 0.
4. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as they have a value of 59 for that item and it is the highest among remaining items for agent 1.
5. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as they have a value of 30 for that item, and it complements their already assigned item 1.

The allocations can be summarized as:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation while ensuring fairness among the agents.
