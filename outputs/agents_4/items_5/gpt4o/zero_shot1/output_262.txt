Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  82  92  63  45
1  27  72  35  55  86
2  92  73  12  24  96
3  15  89  96  46  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This is a typical application of the assignment problem, which can be solved using algorithms like the Hungarian method. However, for simplicity, let's use a heuristic approach to allocate the items based on individual maximum valuations for each item.

First, let's consider the given valuations:

```
Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4
-------------|----|----|----|----|----
      0      | 58 | 82 | 92 | 63 | 45
      1      | 27 | 72 | 35 | 55 | 86
      2      | 92 | 73 | 12 | 24 | 96
      3      | 15 | 89 | 96 | 46 | 14
```

We'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most. If two agents value an item equally, we'll make an arbitrary choice. Here's how the allocations would look:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (92).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (82).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (96).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (63).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (96).

Based on these valuations, we get the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 3: Item 2

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations.
