Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  89  15  71  51
1   9  54  23  13   7
2  92  29  10  80  42
3  93  33  30  94  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total satisfaction of all agents based on their valuations. One common method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each item is only assigned once and each agent can receive one or more items.

Let's evaluate the values and allocate:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0: 9
   - Agent 1: 9
   - Agent 2: 92
   - Agent 3: 93
   - Highest value: Agent 3

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0: 89
   - Agent 1: 54
   - Agent 2: 29
   - Agent 3: 33
   - Highest value: Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0: 15
   - Agent 1: 23
   - Agent 2: 10
   - Agent 3: 30
   - Highest value: Agent 3

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0: 71
   - Agent 1: 13
   - Agent 2: 80
   - Agent 3: 94
   - Highest value: Agent 3

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0: 51
   - Agent 1: 7
   - Agent 2: 42
   - Agent 3: 53
   - Highest value: Agent 3

Based on this evaluation, we see that Agent 3 has the highest valuations for items 0, 2, 3, and 4. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1. However, to ensure fairness, we need to distribute items such that no agent gets all items.

Let's try to distribute the items so that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, given the constraints, while maximizing their total valuation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1
- **Agent 1**: No item
- **Agent 2**: Item 3
- **Agent 3**: Items 0, 2, 4

Let's format this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent is considered in the allocation process.
