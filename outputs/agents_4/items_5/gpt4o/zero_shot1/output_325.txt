Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  11  24   0  90
1  98  28  77  86  77
2  45  58  12  90  21
3  85  26  25   2  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [85 26 25  2 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that every item is allocated only once. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 98.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 1.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 58.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 77.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 90.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 90.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while all items are allocated to the agents.
