Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  29  20  28  42
1  28  10  74  65  89
2  74  10  70  57  77
3  78  29  35  10  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 10 74 65 89]
 [74 10 70 57 77]
 [78 29 35 10 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 5 items are allocated in total. One common approach is to utilize the Hungarian algorithm or a greedy algorithm to maximize the overall allocation value. However, given the simplicity of this example, we'll use a straightforward method to balance the allocations.

Let's examine the agent-item valuations:

- Agent 0: [34, 29, 20, 28, 42]
- Agent 1: [28, 10, 74, 65, 89]
- Agent 2: [74, 10, 70, 57, 77]
- Agent 3: [78, 29, 35, 10, 59]

We will try to allocate items to maximize individual agent satisfaction:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most (89).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 values it the most (78).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most after item 4 (74).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it second most (29).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the most after item 0 (57).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations and the total number of items allocated is 5.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
