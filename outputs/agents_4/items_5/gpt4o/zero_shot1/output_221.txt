Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  86  14  58  81
1  41  74  26  61  30
2  21  31  65   5  50
3  65  75  41  75  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 74 26 61 30]
 [21 31 65  5 50]
 [65 75 41 75 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. We need to ensure that the total number of allocated items is exactly 5.

Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest valuation each agent has for any item and try to allocate that item, if possible.
2. Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. Check for conflicts where multiple agents want the same item and resolve them to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (84).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (74).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (65).
- Agent 3 values item 1 and item 3 equally high (75).

Allocate items based on the above preferences, then resolve any conflicts:

1. Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 84).
2. Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 30) to avoid conflict with Agent 3.
3. Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 65).
4. Agent 3 gets item 1 (value 75).
5. The remaining item 3 can go to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it higher than other remaining items.

After resolving conflicts and ensuring all items are allocated, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.
