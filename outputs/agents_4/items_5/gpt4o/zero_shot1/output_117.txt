Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  58  11  37  88
1  40  45  65  96  75
2  72  14  13  26  77
3   1  21  23  50   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 45 65 96 75]
 [72 14 13 26 77]
 [ 1 21 23 50  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation. We'll aim to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the allocation results in a high overall satisfaction. Below is one such allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is for item 4 with a value of 88.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 96.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 with a value of 72.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3, but since it's already allocated to Agent 1, we assign the next best item, which is item 3 with a value of 50.

Now, the remaining item (item 1) can be allocated to the agent with the next highest valuation who doesn't already have an item, or to balance the total number of items among agents.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent one item, and item 2 is left unallocated to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, summing up to the total number of items available. However, since the total number of items is 5, we need to reassign item 2 to an agent to maintain fairness and utilize all available items.

Let's adjust the allocation slightly to achieve full allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This way, Agent 1 receives two items (items 2 and 3), and the remaining agents each receive one item, utilizing all five items in total.
