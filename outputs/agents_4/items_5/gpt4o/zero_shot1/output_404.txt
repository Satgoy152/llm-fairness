Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12   3  75  65  39
1  28  10  60   3  39
2  71  22  66  67  90
3  97  13  30  74  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 22 66 67 90]
 [97 13 30 74 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. We can use a strategy to maximize total valuations, or we can aim to distribute the items such that the agents have relatively balanced perceived values.

Let's proceed by attempting to assign items one by one, considering the highest valuations first:

1. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 97).
2. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 90).
3. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 75).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 74).
5. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (value 22).

Let's check if this allocation results in each agent getting an integer number of items and all items being allocated. Here's the proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 3 gets items 0 and 3.

This allocation assigns all 5 items to the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
