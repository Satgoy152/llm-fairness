Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  96  74  95  28
1  59  40  83  72  93
2  45  71  69  98  86
3  71  22  81  77  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One method to achieve a balanced distribution is to use a greedy approach where we assign items based on the highest valuation available, making sure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (95)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (93)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (98) but already taken.
   - Next highest: Item 4 (86) but already taken.
   - Next highest: Item 1 (71)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (71)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, to fairly distribute the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0** already has one item.
6. **Agent 1** and **Agent 3** already have one item each.
7. **Agent 2** has one item. 

The remaining unallocated item is Item 2. To allocate it fairly, we can give it to the agent with the second-highest valuation for it:

- Highest remaining valuation for Item 2 is with Agent 1 (83).

Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items have been allocated.
