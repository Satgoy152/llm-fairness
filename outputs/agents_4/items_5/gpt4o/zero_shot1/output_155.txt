Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  52   9  81  95
1  75  73  85  38   6
2  99  13  76  56  80
3  57  68  44  96  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value of the allocations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction across agents is maximized.

Let's start by examining the valuations and consider allocating items based on maximizing individual agent value while ensuring fairness:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (95).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (85).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (99).
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (96).

Now, let's allocate these high-value items to each respective agent:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have one item left: item 1. We need to allocate this item such that it benefits the overall satisfaction. Let's analyze who values item 1 the most:

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 52.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 73.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 13.
- Agent 3 values item 1 at 68.

Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 73, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair allocation of items based on maximizing their individual valuation for the items they receive.
