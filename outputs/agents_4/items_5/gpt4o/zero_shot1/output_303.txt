Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  37   3   8  35   7
1  57  37  99  11  88
2  87  40  37  82  91
3  61   1  61   7  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 37 99 11 88]
 [87 40 37 82 91]
 [61  1 61  7 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach such as maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Here, we aim to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, but since there are more agents than items, some agents will end up with no items.

A straightforward method is to assign the highest-valued items to each agent, considering their preferences.

Let's analyze the table:

```
Agent 0: [37, 3, 8, 35, 7]
Agent 1: [57, 37, 99, 11, 88]
Agent 2: [87, 40, 37, 82, 91]
Agent 3: [61, 1, 61, 7, 72]
```

1. Agent 2 values item 4 the most (91).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (99).
3. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (37).
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (61), but let's give item 0 to Agent 0 since Agent 3's next highest preference, item 2, is already taken by Agent 1.

Now, let's allocate based on the remaining highest preferences:

- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (since item 0 and 2 are already taken).
- This leaves item 1 to be allocated to the agent with the next highest valuation which hasn't received an item yet.

After allocation, Agent 3 still needs an item, the remaining item 1 is allocated to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation assigns each item in such a way that each agent gets at least one item and the total value for each agent is considered.
