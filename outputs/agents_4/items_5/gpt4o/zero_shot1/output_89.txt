Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  59  22  97  89
1  57  43  43  70  31
2  71   8  13  47  96
3  89   1  93   8  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71  8 13 47 96]
 [89  1 93  8 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuations for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. This involves checking each agent's highest-valued items and distributing accordingly.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: 22, 59, 22, 97, 89
- Agent 1: 57, 43, 43, 70, 31
- Agent 2: 71, 8, 13, 47, 96
- Agent 3: 89, 1, 93, 8, 49

The goal is to allocate the 5 items to the 4 agents such that each gets an optimal share based on their valuations. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (97).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (57).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (96).
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (93).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 1 can be given to Agent 0, who values it at 59, which is relatively high compared to other items.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on relatively high valuations for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
