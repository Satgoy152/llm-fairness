Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  59  58  62  39
1   7  83   9  17  15
2  45  89  25  50  75
3  35   4  99  48  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [35  4 99 48 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. Analyze the valuations to identify the highest preferences for each agent.
2. Assign items to maximize individual agent valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.

Below is a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (62).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (83).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (89), but since item 1 is already taken by Agent 1, assign item 4 to Agent 2 (75).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (99).

This leaves item 0 unallocated. We assign it to Agent 0, as it has the second-highest valuation for this item (25), and this balances the allocations a bit more.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives items based on their preferences.
