Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  70  95  13  40
1  17   1  50  54  67
2  59  58  87  76  29
3   1  58  86   7  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51 70 95 13 40]
 [17  1 50 54 67]
 [59 58 87 76 29]
 [ 1 58 86  7 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This can help ensure that items are allocated efficiently based on preferences. Let's go through the table and allocate each item:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 51
   - Agent 1 values it at 17
   - Agent 2 values it at 59
   - Agent 3 values it at 1
   - Highest value is 59 by Agent 2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 70
   - Agent 1 values it at 1
   - Agent 2 values it at 58
   - Agent 3 values it at 58
   - Highest value is 70 by Agent 0. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 95
   - Agent 1 values it at 50
   - Agent 2 values it at 87
   - Agent 3 values it at 86
   - Highest value is 95 by Agent 0. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 13
   - Agent 1 values it at 54
   - Agent 2 values it at 76
   - Agent 3 values it at 7
   - Highest value is 76 by Agent 2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 40
   - Agent 1 values it at 67
   - Agent 2 values it at 29
   - Agent 3 values it at 67
   - Highest value is 67 by both Agent 1 and Agent 3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (to ensure Agent 1 receives at least one item).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": []
}
```
