Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  60  30  44  26
1  43  27  67  91   2
2  36  31  65  21  78
3   4  12  36  42  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents by distributing items such that each agent's sum of valuations is as high as possible. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 at 93.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 3 has the highest valuation for Agent 1 at 91.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 4 has the highest valuation for Agent 2 at 78.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 2 has the highest valuation for Agent 3 at 36.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Item (1):**
   - Item 1 has not yet been assigned. We look for the highest valuation for this item:
     - Agent 0 values it at 60.
     - Agent 2 values it at 31.
     - Agent 1 values it at 27.
     - Agent 3 values it at 12.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it.

Now we have allocated all 5 items fairly to maximize total satisfaction, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed, maximizing the overall value each agent receives.
