Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  91  40   9  49
1  55  62  86  17  53
2  81  40  63  27  33
3   6  75  80  71  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[43 91 40  9 49]
 [55 62 86 17 53]
 [81 40 63 27 33]
 [ 6 75 80 71 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation. We aim to assign items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as high as possible, ensuring each agent gets at least one item or as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the table and find an allocation that maximizes the total valuation:

```
Agent 0: [43, 91, 40, 9, 49]
Agent 1: [55, 62, 86, 17, 53]
Agent 2: [81, 40, 63, 27, 33]
Agent 3: [6, 75, 80, 71, 88]
```

A potential way to allocate the items is to give each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (81)
2. Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (91)
3. Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (86)
4. Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (71)
5. Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (88)

Now, we can allocate these items to ensure each agent gets an item, if possible, and the allocation looks balanced:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 3, 4

This allocation ensures each agent except Agent 3 gets one item, and Agent 3 gets two items, which balances the allocation based on the valuations.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
