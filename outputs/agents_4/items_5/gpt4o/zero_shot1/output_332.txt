Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  39  99  75   6
1  58  58  48  63  55
2  76  43  29  57  87
3  89  66  99  58   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 39 99 75  6]
 [58 58 48 63 55]
 [76 43 29 57 87]
 [89 66 99 58  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for the agents while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  39  99  75   6
1  58  58  48  63  55
2  76  43  29  57  87
3  89  66  99  58   2
```

We can start by assigning the most valued items to each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no more than five items are allocated in total.

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 99.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 58 (also item 0 at 58, but item 1 is less competitive).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 87.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the most at 99, but since item 2 is already taken by Agent 0, the next highest is item 0 at 89.

Now, let's decide on the remaining allocations:

- Agent 0 has item 2.
- Agent 1 has item 1.
- Agent 2 has item 4.
- Agent 3 has item 0.

This leaves one item, item 3:

- Agent 0 values item 3 at 75.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 63.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 57.
- Agent 3 values item 3 at 58.

Agent 0 values item 3 the highest after their most valued item, so we assign item 3 to Agent 0.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
