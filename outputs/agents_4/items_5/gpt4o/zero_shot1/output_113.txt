Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  62  33  72  17
1  90  83  81  51  20
2  19  55   1  29  31
3  34  73  12  42   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 62 33 72 17]
 [90 83 81 51 20]
 [19 55  1 29 31]
 [34 73 12 42  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives. This can be approached by evaluating the highest value each agent places on the available items and assigning the items to the agents who value them the most. 

Let's analyze the values provided:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 76
- Item 1: 62
- Item 2: 33
- Item 3: 72
- Item 4: 17

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 90
- Item 1: 83
- Item 2: 81
- Item 3: 51
- Item 4: 20

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 19
- Item 1: 55
- Item 2: 1
- Item 3: 29
- Item 4: 31

Agent 3:
- Item 0: 34
- Item 1: 73
- Item 2: 12
- Item 3: 42
- Item 4: 7

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents based on their highest valuations:

1. Item 0:
   - Highest value is 90 by Agent 1.

2. Item 1:
   - Highest value is 83 by Agent 1.

3. Item 2:
   - Highest value is 81 by Agent 1.

4. Item 3:
   - Highest value is 72 by Agent 0.

5. Item 4:
   - Highest value is 31 by Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated items based on the highest values per agent:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: []

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, maximizing total satisfaction.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": []
}
```
