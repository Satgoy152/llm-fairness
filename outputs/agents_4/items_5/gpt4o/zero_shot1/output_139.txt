Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  34  48  86  30
1  82  83  68  56  78
2  36  38  68  17  90
3  30  34  78  27  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 83 68 56 78]
 [36 38 68 17 90]
 [30 34 78 27 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Since there are four agents and five items, one agent will receive two items. I'll start by analyzing the valuations and making allocations based on maximizing the total value for each agent. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** This agent values item 3 the most (value: 86).
2. **Agent 1:** This agent values item 0 the most (value: 82).
3. **Agent 2:** This agent values item 4 the most (value: 90).
4. **Agent 3:** This agent values item 2 the most (value: 78).

This allocation gives each agent their highest-valued item. Since only four items are allocated and one more needs to be allocated to ensure all items are distributed, I'll allocate the remaining item 1 to an agent with the next highest value for it:

- **Agent 1** also has a high valuation for item 1 (value: 83).

Thus, a fair allocation, considering high valuations and ensuring each agent has at least one item, is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
