Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  73  49  38  31
1  95  91  93  14  40
2  99  29  35   6  42
3  36  90  24   5  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation across all agents. One common approach is the "Max Sum" allocation, which aims to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes the sum of their valuations.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest at 99.
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it the highest at 90.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 93.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 38.
   - Item 4: Agent 3 values it the highest at 89.

2. **Allocate items to agents based on the highest value identified:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.

3. **Adjust for fairness and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:**
   - Agent 2 gets Item 0.
   - Agent 3 gets Items 1 and 4.
   - Agent 1 gets Item 2.
   - Agent 0 gets Item 3.

4. **Ensure only 5 items are allocated:**
   - Total items allocated: 5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation is designed to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuation while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent is considered.
