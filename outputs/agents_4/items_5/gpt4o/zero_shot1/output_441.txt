Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  30  53   7  76
1  14  96  73  90  11
2  34  97  20  42  38
3  79  75  97  59  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [79 75 97 59 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 5 items to distribute among 4 agents, at least one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 or none.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Values: [54, 30, 53, 7, 76]
   - Highest value items for Agent 0: Item 4 (76), Item 0 (54)

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Values: [14, 96, 73, 90, 11]
   - Highest value items for Agent 1: Item 1 (96), Item 3 (90)

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Values: [34, 97, 20, 42, 38]
   - Highest value items for Agent 2: Item 1 (97), Item 3 (42)

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Values: [79, 75, 97, 59, 48]
   - Highest value items for Agent 3: Item 2 (97), Item 0 (79)

Considering the highest value item for each agent and ensuring fair distribution, here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Item 4 (highest value for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1:** Item 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2:** Item 3 (second-highest value for Agent 2, since Item 1 is already taken)
- **Agent 3:** Item 2 (highest value for Agent 3)
- **Agent 0:** Item 0 (second-highest value for Agent 0)

This allocation allows each agent to receive items they highly value and ensures all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences, maximizing individual satisfaction based on the given valuations.
