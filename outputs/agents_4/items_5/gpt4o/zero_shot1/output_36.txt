Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  72  52  36  31
1  25   8  90  52  39
2  76  20  25  95  30
3  89  31  49  47  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we may try to optimize based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Here, I'll attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives roughly equal value considering the constraints:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (72), Item 2 (52)
   - Allocation: Item 1

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 2 (90)
   - Allocation: Item 2

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 3 (95)
   - Allocation: Item 3

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (89), Item 4 (50)
   - Allocation: Item 0 and Item 4

Considering these allocations, each agent is assigned at least one item, and all items are distributed. The allocations aim to maximize the value for each agent while balancing the total distribution.

Hereâ€™s the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
