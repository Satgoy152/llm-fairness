Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  58  65   8  42
1  90  30  16  47  10
2  70  31   0  96  13
3  94  10  75  82  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 30 16 47 10]
 [70 31  0 96 13]
 [94 10 75 82 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation by each agent for the items they receive. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify which items each agent values the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, but the primary goal is to maximize the total valuation across all agents.

Letâ€™s evaluate the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (65).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (90).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (96).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most, but since item 0 is already claimed, the next highest is item 3 (82), followed by item 2 (75).

Now let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3, as it's the highest remaining value for them after item 0 and 3 are allocated.
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it increases their valuation without conflicting with the highest values of others.

The allocation will be:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 4

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
