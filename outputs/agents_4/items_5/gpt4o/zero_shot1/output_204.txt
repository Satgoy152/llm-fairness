Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88   2  77  65   1
1  26  67  29  19  27
2  79  78   6  10  15
3  82  56  65  33  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 56 65 33 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. We will consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items such that the agents' total valuations are as high as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 0 (88).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 1 (67).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2 (6).
- Agent 3 has relatively high values for items 3 (33) and 4 (52).

Based on these observations, we can attempt the following allocation:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the total number of items (5) is allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation is balanced based on the given valuations and the constraints provided.
