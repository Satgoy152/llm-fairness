Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  72  82  77  28
1   7  14  41  41  76
2  70  49  38  13  56
3  59  35  79  46  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 14 41 41 76]
 [70 49 38 13 56]
 [59 35 79 46 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation of the items each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, and 3. We can give them item 2 which has the highest valuation of 82.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation of 76 for item 4. We allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation of 70 for item 0. We allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a high valuation of 79 for item 2, but item 2 is already allocated. So, we give them item 3 with a valuation of 46.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 2, 3, and 4, leaving item 1 unallocated.

5. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 1, we give item 1 to agent 0.

The allocations now look like this in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing the valuations for each agent based on the given table.
