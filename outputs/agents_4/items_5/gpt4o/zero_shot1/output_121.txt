Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  82  86  42  19
1  18  64   6  95  14
2   6  49  85  51  72
3  40  82  67  79  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 64  6 95 14]
 [ 6 49 85 51 72]
 [40 82 67 79 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.

Let's consider an allocation strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 as it has the highest value for this agent (value = 86).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as it has the highest value for this agent (value = 95).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 as it has a relatively high value for this agent (value = 72).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3 as it has the highest value for this agent (value = 82).

5. **Remaining Item:**
   - The only remaining item is item 0. Assign it to Agent 0 as it has a high value for this agent (value = 77).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
