Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  85  32   5  65
1  77  64  34  54  23
2   5  25  92  59  74
3  35  63  95  63  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the sum of the valuations for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to assign the highest-valued item available to each agent in turn, until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 1 (85)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (77)
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 2 (92)
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value: Item 2 (95) -> Already taken, so next highest is Item 4 (72)

Now, each agent has one item, and we have one more item to allocate:

5. Check remaining unallocated items and assign them:
   - Remaining item: Item 3
   - Assign to the agent who values it the most, and it is unallocated: 
     - Agent 2 values Item 3 at 59

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and all agents are included.
