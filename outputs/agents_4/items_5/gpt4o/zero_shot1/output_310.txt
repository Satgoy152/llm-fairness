Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  63  29   1  88
1   0  87  11  67  29
2  58  32  20  25  91
3  39   0   6  27   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[31 63 29  1 88]
 [ 0 87 11 67 29]
 [58 32 20 25 91]
 [39  0  6 27  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [31, 63, 29, 1, 88]
   - Highest value is for item 4 (88).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [0, 87, 11, 67, 29]
   - Highest value is for item 1 (87).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [58, 32, 20, 25, 91]
   - Highest value is for item 4 (91), but it's already taken by agent 0, so we look at the next highest.
   - Next highest value is for item 0 (58).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [39, 0, 6, 27, 0]
   - Highest value is for item 0 (39), but it's already taken by agent 2, so we look at the next highest.
   - Next highest value is for item 3 (27).

#### Allocation Strategy:
- Allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

Now, we have one item left, item 2. We will assign it to the agent who can derive the most utility from it, among those who have not received their highest valued item:
- Agent 0: Value for item 2 is 29.
- Agent 1: Value for item 2 is 11.
- Agent 2: Value for item 2 is 20.
- Agent 3: Value for item 2 is 6.

Item 2 will be assigned to agent 0, who values it the most among the remaining options.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
