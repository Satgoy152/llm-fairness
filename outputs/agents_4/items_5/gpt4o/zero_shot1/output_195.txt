Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  89  39  40  12
1  39  90  67  95  78
2  94  61  18  92  55
3  65  41  30  20   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the item valuations for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: [48, 89, 39, 40, 12] 
   - Agent 1: [39, 90, 67, 95, 78]
   - Agent 2: [94, 61, 18, 92, 55]
   - Agent 3: [65, 41, 30, 20, 8]

2. **Identify the highest value for each item**:
   - Item 0: Highest value is 94 (Agent 2)
   - Item 1: Highest value is 90 (Agent 1)
   - Item 2: Highest value is 67 (Agent 1)
   - Item 3: Highest value is 95 (Agent 1)
   - Item 4: Highest value is 78 (Agent 1)

3. **Allocate items to agents based on highest valuations**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items 1, 2, 3, and 4. If we allocate all these to Agent 1, they would get 4 items. To balance the allocation:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value of 94).

4. **Final allocation**:
   - Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 3, 4.
   - Agent 2 receives item 0.
   - Agent 0 and Agent 3 receive no items.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
