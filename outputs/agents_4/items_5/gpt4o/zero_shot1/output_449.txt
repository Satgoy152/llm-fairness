Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  87  57  93  25
1  89   7  84  57  39
2  13  58  68  17  73
3  82  41  18  16  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 87 57 93 25]
 [89  7 84 57 39]
 [13 58 68 17 73]
 [82 41 18 16 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" method, where we aim to maximize the total sum of valuations across all agents.

Let's analyze the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  87  57  93  25
1  89   7  84  57  39
2  13  58  68  17  73
3  82  41  18  16  43
```

We'll allocate the items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 95.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 87.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 84.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 93.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the highest at 73.

However, this allocation method could leave some agents with no items, so we will adjust to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
