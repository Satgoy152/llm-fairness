Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  61  66  18  46
1  88  52  12  51  83
2  22  93  47  77  88
3  28  13  89  98  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 61 66 18 46]
 [88 52 12 51 83]
 [22 93 47 77 88]
 [28 13 89 98 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple approach by analyzing the value each agent places on each item and assigning items to agents to maximize the total valuation.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  61  66  18  46
1  88  52  12  51  83
2  22  93  47  77  88
3  28  13  89  98  78
```

Let's consider the highest valuations for each item and allocate accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 88 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 93 by Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 89 by Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 98 by Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 88 by Agent 2.

Now, we should allocate these items to ensure each agent gets a fair share and all items are allocated:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 has high values for both Items 2 and 3).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has a moderate valuation and hasn't received any item yet, and it balances the allocation).

This ensures all items are allocated while considering fairness and maximizing valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the total valuation based on the given preferences.
