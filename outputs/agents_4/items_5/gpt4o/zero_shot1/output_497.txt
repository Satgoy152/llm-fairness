Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  84  66  69  73
1  53  17  54   9  58
2  46  13   2  99  76
3  14   5  94  30   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a variation of the "Greedy Algorithm" for fair allocation. We will assign items to the agents based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent gets the most value possible.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 53.
   
2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 84.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 94.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 99.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 76.

Now, let's allocate the items based on this analysis:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 2.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
