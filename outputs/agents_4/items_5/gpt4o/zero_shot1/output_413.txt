Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  34  50  93  21
1  46  13  22  11   2
2  74  41  73  46  31
3  15  23  48  59  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 23 48 59 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuations for each agent, ideally aiming for each agent to receive at least one item, if possible. Let's examine the valuations and make the allocations:

Valuations:
- Agent 0: [63, 34, 50, 93, 21]
- Agent 1: [46, 13, 22, 11, 2]
- Agent 2: [74, 41, 73, 46, 31]
- Agent 3: [15, 23, 48, 59, 44]

Let's allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Item 0: Highest value (74) by Agent 2.
2. Item 1: Highest value (41) by Agent 2.
3. Item 2: Highest value (73) by Agent 2.
4. Item 3: Highest value (93) by Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Highest value (44) by Agent 3.

Now, to ensure each agent gets at least one item, we can make minor adjustments:

- Agent 2 has too many items. Let's reallocate item 1 (second highest value 34 by Agent 0) to Agent 0.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 1, Item 3
- Agent 1: No items (Agent 1 has very low valuations)
- Agent 2: Item 0, Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 4

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while maximizing the total valuation based on the highest bid for each item.
