Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  22  93  31  82
1  10  61  79  73  76
2  51  36  60  39  59
3   1   9  52  40  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 1  9 52 40 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. A simple approach involves assigning items based on the highest individual valuations for each agent. Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (93)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (79) (already allocated to Agent 0)
   - Next highest valuation: Item 4 (76)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (60) (already allocated to Agent 0)
   - Next highest valuation: Item 4 (59) (already allocated to Agent 1)
   - Next highest valuation: Item 0 (51)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (52) (already allocated to Agent 0)
   - Next highest valuation: Item 3 (40)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate one more item to complete the allocation:

- Available items: 1
- Unallocated agents: None (but Agent 2 and Agent 3 can receive more)

Let's assign the remaining item (Item 1) based on maximizing the value:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (22)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (61)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (36)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (9)

Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it provides the highest additional valuation.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and agents receive items based on their highest valuations, given constraints.
