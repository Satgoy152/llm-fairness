Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  78  63  16  33
1  68  14  33  19  28
2  39  50  82   0  34
3  11   9  93  13  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 78 63 16 33]
 [68 14 33 19 28]
 [39 50 82  0 34]
 [11  9 93 13 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider maximizing the total valuation for all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one potential way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Could be assigned item 1 (valuation 78), as this is the highest valuation for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Could be assigned item 0 (valuation 68), as this is the highest valuation for agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Could be assigned item 2 (valuation 82), as this is the highest valuation for agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Could be assigned items 3 and 4 (valuation 13 and 41), as this maximizes their total valuation.

The allocations based on the above reasoning are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
