Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  31  17  41   1
1  56  29  25  35  31
2  26  64  80  48  52
3  50  31  59  56  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 31 17 41  1]
 [56 29 25 35 31]
 [26 64 80 48 52]
 [50 31 59 56 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will use a simple approach to allocate items, considering the highest valuations first.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [70, 31, 17, 41, 1]
Agent 1: [56, 29, 25, 35, 31]
Agent 2: [26, 64, 80, 48, 52]
Agent 3: [50, 31, 59, 56, 62]
```

We'll allocate items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 with 80.
2. **Item 0**: The next highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 70.
3. **Item 1**: The next highest valuation is by Agent 2 with 64.
4. **Item 4**: The next highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 62.
5. **Item 3**: The next highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 56.

Allocating based on these highest valuations, we have:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 4.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
