Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  78  83  75   7
1  75   7  65  99   8
2  54  63  46  65  16
3  30  68  45   2  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will try to distribute the items to the agents based on their preferences as shown in the table.

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing the total satisfaction of the agents:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 3. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 3. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the most. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. Finally, for item 2, Agent 0 has the highest valuation. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

Based on this logic, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and attempts to maximize the valuation each agent receives.
