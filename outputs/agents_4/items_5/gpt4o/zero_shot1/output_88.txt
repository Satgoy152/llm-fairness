Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  69  46  95  34
1   2  46  96   1  30
2  40  66  78  76  20
3  66  48  69  46  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations. The goal is to assign items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items assigned is exactly 5. 

We can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for all agents, ensuring a fair distribution. In this case, we can use a simple greedy approach to assign the highest valued items to agents, considering the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [90, 69, 46, 95, 34]
- Agent 1 values: [2, 46, 96, 1, 30]
- Agent 2 values: [40, 66, 78, 76, 20]
- Agent 3 values: [66, 48, 69, 46, 44]

We can assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 3 (highest value: 95)
2. Agent 1 gets item 2 (highest value: 96)
3. Agent 2 gets item 1 (highest value: 66)
4. Agent 3 gets item 0 (highest value: 66)

Now, we have one item left to assign (item 4). We consider the remaining possible allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 at 34
- Agent 1 values item 4 at 30
- Agent 2 values item 4 at 20
- Agent 3 values item 4 at 44 (highest remaining)

Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 5 items are fairly distributed based on the given valuations.
