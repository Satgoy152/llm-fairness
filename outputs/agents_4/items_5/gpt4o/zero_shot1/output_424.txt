Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  93  11  68  26
1  12  42  86  55   1
2  90  13  68  38  35
3  76  39  70  51  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 13 68 38 35]
 [76 39 70 51 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations of each agent for each item. One common approach is to sequentially assign items based on the highest relative value for each agent, ensuring that no agent receives more than their fair share of the total value.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [51, 93, 11, 68, 26]
- Agent 1 values: [12, 42, 86, 55, 1]
- Agent 2 values: [90, 13, 68, 38, 35]
- Agent 3 values: [76, 39, 70, 51, 76]

We'll allocate items based on the highest value for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 90 by Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 93 by Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 86 by Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 68 by Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 76 by Agent 3.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust if necessary, but since each highest value is unique, this is not an issue here.

Here's the allocation based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 3
- Agent 1 gets item: 2
- Agent 2 gets item: 0
- Agent 3 gets item: 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
