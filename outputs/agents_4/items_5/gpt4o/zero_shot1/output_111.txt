Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  59  96   1  70
1  61  22  16  86  49
2  26  85  73  44  35
3  99  31  13  62  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the overall valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 42
   - Agent 1 values it at 61
   - Agent 2 values it at 26
   - Agent 3 values it at 99 (highest valuation)

   Allocate Item 0 to Agent 3.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Agent 2 values it at 85 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 3 values it at 31

   Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 1 values it at 16
   - Agent 2 values it at 73
   - Agent 3 values it at 13

   Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 1
   - Agent 1 values it at 86 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2 values it at 44
   - Agent 3 values it at 62

   Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 70
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Agent 2 values it at 35
   - Agent 3 values it at 79 (highest valuation)

   Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.

Here is the final allocation of items in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
