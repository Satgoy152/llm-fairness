Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  33  16  20  10
1  18  42  91  29  26
2  60  62  78  22  90
3  35  26  25  67  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [35 26 25 67 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the agents' valuations of the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or value derived from the allocation. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign that item to the corresponding agent, if possible.

2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, by considering the next highest valuations for unassigned items.

3. Balance the allocations to ensure fairness and maximize total valuation.

Let's go through the process:

- **Item 0:** The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (89). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

- **Item 1:** The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (62). Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.

- **Item 2:** The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (91). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

- **Item 3:** The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (67). Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.

- **Item 4:** The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (90). Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0 has Item 0.
- Agent 1 has Item 2.
- Agent 2 has Items 1 and 4.
- Agent 3 has Item 3.

Each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
