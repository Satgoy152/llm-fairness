Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85   8  59  40  77
1   5  22  56  29  87
2  38  73  82  54  15
3  10  62  17  85  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85  8 59 40 77]
 [ 5 22 56 29 87]
 [38 73 82 54 15]
 [10 62 17 85 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [85, 8, 59, 40, 77]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [5, 22, 56, 29, 87]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [38, 73, 82, 54, 15]
- Agent 3 values items as follows: [10, 62, 17, 85, 92]

A good approach is to start by assigning each agent the item they value the most that hasn't already been allocated. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value is 85 for item 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value is 87 for item 4.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is 82 for item 2.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value is 92 for item 4, but it's already taken by agent 1.
   - Next highest is 85 for item 3.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

Now, we've allocated items 0, 2, 3, and 4. There is one item left, item 1.

5. For the remaining item 1, check who values it the most:
   - Agent 0: 8
   - Agent 1: 22
   - Agent 2: 73
   - Agent 3: 62
   - Highest value is 73 by agent 2.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

All items are now allocated. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
