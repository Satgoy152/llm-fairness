Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  34  59  48  60
1  11  85  80  39  11
2  40  55  23  37  61
3  52   6  65  82   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52  6 65 82  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

We can use a greedy approach to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here is the allocation strategy:

1. Item 0:
   - Values: [97, 11, 40, 52]
   - Highest value is 97 by Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. Item 1:
   - Values: [34, 85, 55, 6]
   - Highest value is 85 by Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. Item 2:
   - Values: [59, 80, 23, 65]
   - Highest value is 80 by Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. Item 3:
   - Values: [48, 39, 37, 82]
   - Highest value is 82 by Agent 3.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.

5. Item 4:
   - Values: [60, 11, 61, 2]
   - Highest value is 61 by Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

After these allocations, we ensure that each agent receives items based on their highest valuation, and all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
