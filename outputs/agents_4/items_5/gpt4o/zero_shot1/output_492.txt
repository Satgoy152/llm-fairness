Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  19  37   8  23
1  31  45   9  76  30
2  32  18  73  92  82
3  42  32   4   0  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll consider each agent's highest valued items and attempt to distribute them accordingly, ensuring no agent receives more than one item unless necessary due to the total number of items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (91).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (76).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (92), but since Agent 1 already has item 3, we give Agent 2 their next highest valued item, which is item 2 (73).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 (42), but since Agent 0 already has item 0, we assign Agent 3 their next highest valued item, which is item 1 (32).

Now, let's allocate the remaining item:

- Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 4 (82).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations while distributing all 5 items.
