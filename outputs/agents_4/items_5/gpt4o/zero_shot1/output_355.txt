Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  50  62  43  62
1  90  55  62  19  28
2   2  83  83  80  58
3  12  50  45  55  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [12 50 45 55 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. This is often referred to as maximizing the social welfare. Here, we can try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is as balanced as possible.

Let's start by looking at the highest valuations for each agent and try to allocate items based on maximizing those valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here are the highest valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: Item 2 with a value of 62
- Agent 1: Item 0 with a value of 90
- Agent 2: Item 1 or 2 with a value of 83
- Agent 3: Item 4 with a value of 98

Now, we will allocate these items accordingly:
1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value is 90).
2. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value is 62).
3. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value is 98).
4. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value is 83).

At this stage, all agents except Agent 2 have at least one item. Item 3 is left to be allocated. Based on the remaining highest valuation for Item 3:
- Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for Item 3 (80).

Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2. Now, each agent has at least one item.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.
