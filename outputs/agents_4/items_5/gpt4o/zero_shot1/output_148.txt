Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  32  35  60   7
1  28  33  98   8  49
2  51  63   9  85  92
3  52  68  25   5  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 63  9 85 92]
 [52 68 25  5 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total value or ensuring each agent receives items they value highly. Let's consider maximizing the overall satisfaction by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (77)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (98)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (92)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (68)

This allocation leaves us with item 3 unallocated. To decide who should receive it, we can allocate based on the next highest valuation among the agents who have not received a second item:

- Agent 2 values item 3 at 85, which is the highest remaining valuation for item 3.

Based on this reasoning, here is a fair allocation of items:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an item they value highly, and only 5 items are allocated in total.
