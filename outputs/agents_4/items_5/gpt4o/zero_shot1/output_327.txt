Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  54  93  46  72
1  19  92   8  40  87
2  10  13  68  63  11
3  13  86   7  16  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19 92  8 40 87]
 [10 13 68 63 11]
 [13 86  7 16 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple method of maximizing the total value that each agent receives. Each agent should get at least one item, and no item should be allocated to more than one agent. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [23, 54, 93, 46, 72]
- Agent 1: [19, 92, 8, 40, 87]
- Agent 2: [10, 13, 68, 63, 11]
- Agent 3: [13, 86, 7, 16, 70]

We can start by assigning each agent their most valued item, which is not already taken. After that, we allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution.

1. Agent 0's highest value is for item 2 (93).
2. Agent 1's highest value is for item 1 (92).
3. Agent 2's highest value is for item 3 (63).
4. Agent 3's highest value is for item 1 (86), but item 1 is already taken. The next highest is item 4 (70).

Now, items 0 and 4 are not allocated yet. Let's allocate these items to the agents who would gain the most additional value:

- Agent 0's second highest value is for item 4 (72).
- Agent 1's second highest value is for item 4 (87), but item 4 will be allocated to Agent 3. Next is item 0 (19).
- Agent 3's second highest value is for item 3 (16), but item 3 is already taken. Next is item 0 (13).

To ensure fairness and maximum value, we can allocate:

- Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Item 4 to Agent 3.

Thus, the allocations are:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
