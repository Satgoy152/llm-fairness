Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  96  50  50  45
1   9   0  31  24  14
2  49  24   5   8  73
3  19  78  65  83   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 24  5  8 73]
 [19 78 65 83  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  96  50  50  45
1   9   0  31  24  14
2  49  24   5   8  73
3  19  78  65  83   5
```

To allocate the items, we can use a greedy approach where we prioritize giving each agent the item which they value the most, then proceed with the next most valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 4, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 3, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- We still have item 0 left. The highest value for item 0 among the agents not yet fully satisfied is Agent 2, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

After these allocations, each item is allocated, and the total value for each agent is maximized as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly based on the valuations provided.
