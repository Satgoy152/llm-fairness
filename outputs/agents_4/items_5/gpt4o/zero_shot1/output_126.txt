Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  94  76   7  23
1  45  42  21  44  40
2  13  99  42  19  97
3   3  66  72  55  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we want to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from the items they are allocated. Given that each agent can receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, we need to distribute the 5 items in a way that attempts to maximize fairness.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [73, 94, 76, 7, 23]
- Agent 1: [45, 42, 21, 44, 40]
- Agent 2: [13, 99, 42, 19, 97]
- Agent 3: [3, 66, 72, 55, 66]

We aim to allocate the items so that the agents receive a fair distribution based on their values:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 1 (94) and item 2 (76).
2. Agent 1 has more balanced values, but item 3 (44) is the highest.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 1 (99) and item 4 (97).
4. Agent 3 has relatively high values for item 3 (55) and item 4 (66).

To maximize fairness and balance:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 since it has the highest value (99) for them.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 as it is one of the two highest values (76) for them.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the highest value (73) for them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 since it has a significant value (55).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it is the second-highest value (97) for them.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their highest-valued items, with Agent 0 and Agent 2 receiving slightly more due to their significantly higher valuations for certain items compared to others.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 5 items fairly based on the given valuations.
