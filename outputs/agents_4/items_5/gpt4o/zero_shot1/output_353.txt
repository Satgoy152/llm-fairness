Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  36  97  31  41
1   5  16  38  84  83
2  42  95   7  70  90
3  29  41  85  78  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 36 97 31 41]
 [ 5 16 38 84 83]
 [42 95  7 70 90]
 [29 41 85 78 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a greedy approach to maximize the total valuation. We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's evaluate each item:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 53
  - Agent 1 values it at 5
  - Agent 2 values it at 42
  - Agent 3 values it at 29
  - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 0.

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 36
  - Agent 1 values it at 16
  - Agent 2 values it at 95
  - Agent 3 values it at 41
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 1.

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 97
  - Agent 1 values it at 38
  - Agent 2 values it at 7
  - Agent 3 values it at 85
  - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 2.

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 31
  - Agent 1 values it at 84
  - Agent 2 values it at 70
  - Agent 3 values it at 78
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 3.

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 41
  - Agent 1 values it at 83
  - Agent 2 values it at 90
  - Agent 3 values it at 66
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 4.

Allocating the items based on the highest valuation:

- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 2
- Agent 1 gets Item 3
- Agent 2 gets Items 1 and 4
- Agent 3 gets no items

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": []
}
```
