Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  26  83  59  89
1  71  18   3  90  56
2  72  55  53  27  47
3  28  34  35  24  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 34 35 24 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible and no more than one agent receives the same item.

Let's evaluate the allocation based on maximizing each agent's total value:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values for Agent 0 are items 4 (89), 2 (83), and 0 (80).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values for Agent 1 are items 3 (90), 0 (71), and 4 (56).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values for Agent 2 are items 0 (72), 1 (55), and 2 (53).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest values for Agent 3 are items 4 (57), 2 (35), and 1 (34).

Trying to distribute the items fairly:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 (89) to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (90) to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 (55) to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 2 (35) to Agent 3.

This leaves item 0 (80) to be assigned. Since this item is highly valued by several agents, we can assign it to one of the agents who values it highly without exceeding fairness:

- Assign item 0 (80) to Agent 0, as it is also highly valued by them.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that are relatively highly valued by them.
