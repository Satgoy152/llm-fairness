Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  94  88  73  72
1  27  32  19  93  21
2  86  39  81  90  67
3  97  68  45  52  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[46 94 88 73 72]
 [27 32 19 93 21]
 [86 39 81 90 67]
 [97 68 45 52 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will end up with two items while the other three agents will receive one item each. We'll select allocations to maximize total valuations.

Let's evaluate and allocate:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Valuations: 46, 94, 88, 73, 72
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (94).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Valuations: 27, 32, 19, 93, 21
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (93).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Valuations: 86, 39, 81, 90, 67
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (86).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Valuations: 97, 68, 45, 52, 56
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (97), but it's already allocated to Agent 2. Next highest is item 1 (68).

Now, let's allocate so that each agent gets one item and one agent gets two items:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now only item 2 is left. We will allocate this to the agent who values it the most among those who have only one item.

- Agent 0: 88 (already has item 1)
- Agent 1: 19 (already has item 3)
- Agent 2: 81 (already has item 0)
- Agent 3: 45 (already has item 4)

Agent 0 values item 2 the most among those who have only one item. So, we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
