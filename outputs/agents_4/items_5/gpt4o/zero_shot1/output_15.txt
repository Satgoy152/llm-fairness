Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  93  80  37  81
1  13  92  45   1  94
2  11  14  63  89  15
3  11  11  29  50  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 93 80 37 81]
 [13 92 45  1 94]
 [11 14 63 89 15]
 [11 11 29 50 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Since there are 4 agents and 5 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [36, 93, 80, 37, 81]
Agent 1: [13, 92, 45,  1, 94]
Agent 2: [11, 14, 63, 89, 15]
Agent 3: [11, 11, 29, 50, 23]
```

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (93).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (94).
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest (89).
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest (50), but it is already taken. The next highest is item 2 (29).

We need to ensure that each agent has at least one item and one agent receives two items to make up the total of five items.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (value 93)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 (value 94)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (value 89)
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 2 (value 29)

Now, agent 0 can receive another item since they currently have only one item, and they have the highest value for item 0 among the remaining unallocated items.

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (value 36)

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```
