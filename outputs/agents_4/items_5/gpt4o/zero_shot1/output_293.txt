Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  67  92  19  73
1  11  22  53  88  80
2  18  92  13  45  67
3   7  86  49  22  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 67 92 19 73]
 [11 22 53 88 80]
 [18 92 13 45 67]
 [ 7 86 49 22 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Find the highest valued item for each agent**: Identify the item that each agent values the most.
2. **Assign items based on maximum valuation**: Assign items to agents based on their highest preference, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.
3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Continue assigning any remaining items to agents to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the valuations and perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (92).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (88).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (92).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (86), but we can assign a different item since Agent 2 also strongly prefers item 1.

Given these preferences, we can make the following allocations:

- Item 2 goes to Agent 0.
- Item 3 goes to Agent 1.
- Item 1 goes to Agent 2.
- Item 4 goes to Agent 3.
- Item 0 can be assigned to Agent 0 as it is their next highest preference.

Therefore, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.
