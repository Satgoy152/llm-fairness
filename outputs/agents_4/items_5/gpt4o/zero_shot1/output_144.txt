Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  68  61  14  59
1  30  74   3   7  49
2  76  71  96  91  93
3  96  12  80  40  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Evaluate Each Agent's Preferences**: Look at the values each agent assigns to each item.
2. **Assign Items Strategically**: Try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction across all agents.

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0 values highest: Item 1 (68) and Item 2 (61)
- Agent 1 values highest: Item 1 (74) and Item 0 (30)
- Agent 2 values highest: Item 2 (96) and Item 4 (93)
- Agent 3 values highest: Item 0 (96) and Item 2 (80)

Considering these preferences, a potential fair allocation might prioritize high-value items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign Item 2 (value 61)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign Item 1 (value 74)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign Item 4 (value 93)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Assign Item 0 (value 96)
   - Assign Item 3 (value 40)

Now, each agent has at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible based on the values. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item they highly value, and since the total number of items is 5, all items are allocated.
