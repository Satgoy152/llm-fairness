Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  11  26   9  41
1  82  66  26  52  71
2  17  51   6  31   8
3  30  47  38   2  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 47 38  2 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation where each agent gets items that maximize their individual valuations while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0, so let's allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 4, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** has a reasonably high valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2, so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 2** has the highest remaining valuation for item 3, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Here's how the allocation would look:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
