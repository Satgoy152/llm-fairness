Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  31  51  52  18
1  30  92  78  58   2
2   5  83  38   5  28
3  10  39  29   0  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82 31 51 52 18]
 [30 92 78 58  2]
 [ 5 83 38  5 28]
 [10 39 29  0 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation across all agents, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's the table of valuations again for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  31  51  52  18
1  30  92  78  58   2
2   5  83  38   5  28
3  10  39  29   0  28
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we'll consider the highest valuations for each item and allocate them accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 82.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 92.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 78.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 52.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 has a valuation of 28, the highest among those not already fully allocated.

With this allocation, we ensure each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while maximizing the overall satisfaction.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": []
}
```
