Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  86  97  67  92
1  41  21  13   1  63
2  89  72  89  92   0
3  75  91  50  39  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [89 72 89 92  0]
 [75 91 50 39 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5. One possible approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item by adjusting assignments if necessary.

Let's go through the items one by one and allocate them to the agents:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from Agent 2 (value = 89). Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from Agent 3 (value = 91). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from Agent 0 (value = 97). Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from Agent 2 (value = 92). Since Agent 2 already has an item, look for another agent. Agent 0 has the second-highest valuation (value = 67). Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from Agent 0 (value = 92). Since Agent 0 already has two items, look for another agent. Agent 3 has the second-highest valuation (value = 88). Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, ensure each agent has at least one item. Agent 1 currently has no items. Move Item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 has a non-zero valuation for it.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
