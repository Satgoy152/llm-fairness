Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  63   7  29  36
1  53  43   3  83  49
2  74  82  22   6  93
3  91  35  29  54  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider assigning items based on maximizing the overall utility for all agents while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and no more than one agent is left without an item.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no agent receives more than one item until all agents have at least one item.
2. If some agents end up with no items, reallocate items to maximize the total utility.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 91.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 82.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 7, but since this is low, we might consider reallocation.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 83.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 93.

To ensure fairness and maximize utility, we can follow this allocation:

- Agent 0: [2] (lowest value, this ensures agent 0 gets at least one item)
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]
- Agent 3: [0]

This allocation ensures each agent, except for Agent 0, gets items they value highly, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
