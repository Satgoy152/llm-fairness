Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  71  47  50  23
1  33  90  75  60  75
2  59  60  81  23  32
3  83   2  88  12  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives. This can be achieved by assigning items in a way that considers each agent's preferences while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. Create a list of all possible allocations and their respective values for each agent.
2. Choose assignments that maximize the individual agent's satisfaction and ensure all items are allocated.

Given the valuations table:

| Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 13 | 71 | 47 | 50 | 23 |
| 1          | 33 | 90 | 75 | 60 | 75 |
| 2          | 59 | 60 | 81 | 23 | 32 |
| 3          | 83 | 2  | 88 | 12 | 20 |

Let's analyze the optimal allocation:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1, but since this item is already allocated to Agent 0, Agent 1 will be allocated another item.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 0.

We can try different combinations to find a fair allocation:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, for the remaining items (3 and 4), we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair distribution:

4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 3).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 4 as well).

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations, with each agent receiving an integer number of items and all items being allocated.
