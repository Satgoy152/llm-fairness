Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  89  62  55  77
1   9  17  17  65  26
2  13  45  16  50  11
3  99  72  36  56  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. This approach tries to ensure that each agent receives items that are of high value to them, while distributing the items fairly among the agents.

Let's consider the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [29, 89, 62, 55, 77]
Agent 1: [9, 17, 17, 65, 26]
Agent 2: [13, 45, 16, 50, 11]
Agent 3: [99, 72, 36, 56, 29]
```

We can use a greedy approach to allocate items to the agents:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 1 and 4. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 3 has the highest value (99) for item 0. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
3. Agent 1 values item 3 highly. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 2's highest value is for item 1, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 3, which is also taken. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
5. Item 4 remains unallocated, and Agent 0 has a high value for it, so let's allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Now, let's review the allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0

This allocation ensures each agent receives items of high value to them, maximizing their satisfaction.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
