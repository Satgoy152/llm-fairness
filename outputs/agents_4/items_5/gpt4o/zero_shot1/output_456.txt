Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  81  32  32  68
1  31  24  20  84  77
2  76   9  44   3  17
3   4  59  24  50   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm or optimization technique to maximize the sum of the valuations for each agent's allocated items.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (81), Item 4 (68)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (84), Item 4 (77)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (76), Item 2 (44)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (59), Item 3 (50)

Proceeding with these insights, we can try the following allocation to maximize the overall value:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (81)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (84)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (76)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (24) 
- Remaining item: Item 4 can go to Agent 1 for a total value of 77

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one high-value item, and all 5 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```
