Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  24  97  57  68
1  80  69   8  90  81
2  56  10  37  86  51
3  40   8  14  15  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 24 97 57 68]
 [80 69  8 90 81]
 [56 10 37 86 51]
 [40  8 14 15 46]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation by assigning items to agents based on their preferences. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

### Valuations
- Agent 0: [85, 24, 97, 57, 68]
- Agent 1: [80, 69, 8, 90, 81]
- Agent 2: [56, 10, 37, 86, 51]
- Agent 3: [40, 8, 14, 15, 46]

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: Highest value of 97.
2. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1**: Highest value of 90.
3. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**: Second highest value of 85, as Agent 0 has already been assigned an item, and it maximizes their total value.
4. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1**: Second highest value of 81, similar strategy as above.
5. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**: Highest remaining value for this item.

### Final Allocations
- Agent 0: Items [2, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4, 1]
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: No items

### JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3, 4, 1],
    "2": [],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value for the agents based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
