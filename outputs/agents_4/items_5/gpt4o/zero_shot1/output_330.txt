Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  14  70  65  45
1  40  99  19  51  93
2  86  42  49   2  29
3   0   3  37   3  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[43 14 70 65 45]
 [40 99 19 51 93]
 [86 42 49  2 29]
 [ 0  3 37  3 58]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent and each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 2 items and the others will receive 1 item each. Here's one way to approach it:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would receive if they were given each combination of items.
2. Try to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest values.

Let's examine the valuation table:

- Agent 0: [43, 14, 70, 65, 45]
- Agent 1: [40, 99, 19, 51, 93]
- Agent 2: [86, 42, 49, 2, 29]
- Agent 3: [0, 3, 37, 3, 58]

Allocate items based on the highest value for each item:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 2 (86)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 1 (99)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (70)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 0 (65)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 1 (93)

Now, let's assign items ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing the overall satisfaction. Since Agent 0 and Agent 1 have two of the highest values, we can consider giving them more items if necessary:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 3] (valuations 70 and 65)
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 4] (valuations 99 and 93)
- Agent 2 gets item [0] (valuation 86)
- Agent 3 gets no items as they have low valuations overall

Based on this allocation, here's the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation provides a fair distribution where the items are allocated to agents with the highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
