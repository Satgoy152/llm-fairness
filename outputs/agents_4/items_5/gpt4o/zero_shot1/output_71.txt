Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  49  37  20   8
1  54  41  62  88  84
2  37  87  98  12   8
3  54  75  89  18   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value for all agents. This can often be achieved by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here’s how we can proceed:

1. **Analyze the Valuations:**
   - For each item, identify which agent values it the most.

2. **Assign Items:**
   - Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

Let's evaluate the given valuations:

- **Item 0:**
  - Agent 0: 36
  - Agent 1: 54
  - Agent 2: 37
  - Agent 3: 54
  - Highest value: Agent 1 or 3 (both 54) — Choose one, say Agent 1.

- **Item 1:**
  - Agent 0: 49
  - Agent 1: 41
  - Agent 2: 87
  - Agent 3: 75
  - Highest value: Agent 2 (87)

- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 0: 37
  - Agent 1: 62
  - Agent 2: 98
  - Agent 3: 89
  - Highest value: Agent 2 (98)

- **Item 3:**
  - Agent 0: 20
  - Agent 1: 88
  - Agent 2: 12
  - Agent 3: 18
  - Highest value: Agent 1 (88)

- **Item 4:**
  - Agent 0: 8
  - Agent 1: 84
  - Agent 2: 8
  - Agent 3: 1
  - Highest value: Agent 1 (84)

Based on the above analysis, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: No items
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2
- Agent 3: No items

Now, in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": []
}
```
