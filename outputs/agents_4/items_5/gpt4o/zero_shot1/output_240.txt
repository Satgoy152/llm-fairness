Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  71  97  35   9
1  56  75  54  55  77
2  90  34   6  69  19
3  98  98  69  89  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 4 agents and 5 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1.

Here is one possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

1. Assign the highest value item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.
3. Consider the remaining items and allocate them to maximize each agent's total value.

Based on these steps, we can proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 98).
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 98).
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 97).
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 89).
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 1 (value 77).

Based on this greedy allocation strategy, we can assign items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets no items (since their highest value is significantly lower and we need to distribute items for overall value).
- Agent 3 gets items 0, 1, and 3.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
