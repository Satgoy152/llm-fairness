Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  51  23  91  16
1  74  25  18  63  24
2  18  92  30  27  74
3  96  14  63  50  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [96 14 63 50 49]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, and ensure that each agent gets a fair distribution of items. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 with a value of 91.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 0 with a value of 74.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 with a value of 92.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 2 with a value of 63.

Now, we have one item left (item 4) to allocate:

- **Agent 2** has a fairly high valuation of item 4, with a value of 74.

By following this method, we ensure that each agent receives at least one high-value item based on their preferences. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations.
