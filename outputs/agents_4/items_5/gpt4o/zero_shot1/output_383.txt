Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  11  31  61  17
1  79  16  57  73  10
2  89  29  92  25   6
3  10  37  48  45  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to solve this problem is to assign items based on the highest value for each agent while ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 with a value of 92.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 with a value of 86.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 with a value of 73.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 1 with a value of 37.
5. Agent 0 values item 4 with a value of 17 compared to the other agents.

By following this strategy, each agent gets a high-value item based on their valuation, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, optimizing for the highest individual valuations.
