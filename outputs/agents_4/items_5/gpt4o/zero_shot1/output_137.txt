Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  78  61  25  16
1   8  96  15  30  49
2  58  64  43  10  66
3  80  16  49  75  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute all 5 items.

Let's analyze and allocate items based on the highest valuations:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 with a value of 22.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 with a value of 96.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 with a value of 66.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 75.
5. There is a tie for item 2 between Agent 0 and Agent 3, but Agent 3 has a higher overall valuation for the remaining items.

Based on this, we can allocate as follows:

- Item 0 to Agent 0
- Item 1 to Agent 1
- Item 4 to Agent 2
- Item 3 to Agent 3
- Item 2 to Agent 3

This allocation ensures that each agent is fairly considered, and all items are distributed based on the highest possible valuations. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
