Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  42   8  78  26
1  10  10  17  60  59
2  18  43  50  22  11
3  55  58  50  56  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can consider a strategy where each agent gets the item they value the most, while ensuring each item is only allocated once. Here's a potential fair allocation using a simple greedy algorithm:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (value: 78)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (value: 59)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (value: 50)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (value: 80), but it's already taken by Agent 1.
   - Next highest valuation: Item 1 (value: 58)

After these assignments, we have:
- Agent 0 with Item 3
- Agent 1 with Item 4
- Agent 2 with Item 2
- Agent 3 with Item 1

Item 0 is still unallocated. We assign it to the agent who values it most and doesn't have an item yet, or as a second item if necessary. Agent 0 values Item 0 the most (value: 57), and doesn't have another option, so it would be fair to allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest valuations and only five items are allocated in total.
