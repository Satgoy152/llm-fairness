Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  52  41  67  57
1  36  94  22  65  64
2  14  62  80  97  49
3   4   5  25  31  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 52 41 67 57]
 [36 94 22 65 64]
 [14 62 80 97 49]
 [ 4  5 25 31 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the algorithm known as "maximum weight matching" or an approximation of it. This method aims to maximize the total valuation across all agents for the items they receive. Hereâ€™s how we can approach the allocation:

1. **List each agent's valuations for items:**
   - Agent 0: [98, 52, 41, 67, 57]
   - Agent 1: [36, 94, 22, 65, 64]
   - Agent 2: [14, 62, 80, 97, 49]
   - Agent 3: [4, 5, 25, 31, 46]

2. **Allocate items to maximize total value:**
   - Start by allocating the highest single valuations to agents to ensure they get their most valuable items.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 98).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 94).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 80).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 97).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 46).

4. **Verification:**
   - All items are allocated to ensure each agent gets the maximum value from the items they receive, given that there are only 5 items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their value, given the available items.
