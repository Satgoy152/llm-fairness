Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  45  74   6  27
1  89   7  47  88  91
2  69   8  54  91  93
3  18  68  12  99  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 45 74  6 27]
 [89  7 47 88 91]
 [69  8 54 91 93]
 [18 68 12 99 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent by assigning the items in a manner that ensures each agent receives the items they value the most. Since there are 4 agents and 5 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [70, 45, 74, 6, 27]
Agent 1: [89, 7, 47, 88, 91]
Agent 2: [69, 8, 54, 91, 93]
Agent 3: [18, 68, 12, 99, 69]
```

We can proceed by assigning the items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 1**: The highest overall valuation is by Agent 1 for item 4 (value 91). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2**: The next highest unassigned valuation is by Agent 2 for item 3 (value 91). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0**: The next highest unassigned valuation is by Agent 0 for item 2 (value 74). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 3**: The next highest unassigned valuation is by Agent 3 for item 3 (value 99), but since item 3 is already assigned, we look at the next highest which is item 1 (value 68). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. Now only item 0 remains unassigned. The highest valuation for item 0 is by Agent 1 (value 89), but since Agent 1 already has an item, assign item 0 to Agent 0 who values it at 70.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their preferences based on the given valuations.
