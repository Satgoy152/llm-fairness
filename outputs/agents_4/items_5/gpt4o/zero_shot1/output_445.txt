Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53   4  75  99  69
1  84  56  70  54  36
2  73  62  22  57  94
3  22  91  53  48  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their individual valuations, we can follow a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List all item valuations for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: [53, 4, 75, 99, 69]
   - Agent 1: [84, 56, 70, 54, 36]
   - Agent 2: [73, 62, 22, 57, 94]
   - Agent 3: [22, 91, 53, 48, 83]

2. **Determine the highest value each item holds for any agent**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (84)
   - Item 1: Agent 3 (91)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (75)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (99)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (94)

3. **Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuations**:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2

4. **Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated**:
   - Agent 0 gets Items [2, 3]
   - Agent 1 gets Item [0]
   - Agent 2 gets Item [4]
   - Agent 3 gets Item [1]

5. **Present the allocations in the requested JSON format**:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total valuation across all agents is maximized based on their preferences.
