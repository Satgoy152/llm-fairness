Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  37  49  22  68
1  94  65  17  69  20
2  55  28  48  31  98
3   9   6  15  90  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 37 49 22 68]
 [94 65 17 69 20]
 [55 28 48 31 98]
 [ 9  6 15 90 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation table and try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. Each agent should get at least one item, and the total number of items must add up to 5.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (68). So, allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (94). So, allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (98), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 2 (48). So, allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (90). So, allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Item 1 is left. The highest valuation for item 1 among the remaining allocations is agent 1 (65), but agent 1 already has an item. The next highest is agent 0 (37). Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the agents' satisfaction according to the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
