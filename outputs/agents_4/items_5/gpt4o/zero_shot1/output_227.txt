Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  23  57  55  85
1  29  25  42  96  83
2  92  13  52  83   0
3   6   1  12  58  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to try to maximize the minimum satisfaction among all agents to ensure fairness. Here, we aim to distribute the items while trying to respect the agents' preferences as much as possible.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 85, followed by item 2 at 57.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 96, followed by item 4 at 83.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 92, followed by item 3 at 83.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most at 58, followed by item 2 at 12.

Given this, we can try to allocate the items based on the highest valuation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, since they value it highly (85), and Agent 1 values it as second priority.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their highest value (96), and it is also highly valued by Agent 2.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest value (92).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest value (57).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 3, since it's the least desired item, and Agent 3 has the lowest valuations, giving them at least one item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed in a way that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible.

Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```
