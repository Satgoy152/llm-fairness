Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  20  76  77  31
1  22  33  20  53  55
2  13  30   7   3  59
3  84  50   1  22  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider maximizing the total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 2 and 3 highly. We can allocate item 3 to agent 0 since it has the highest value for this agent.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the highest. We allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 4 the highest, but since it's already allocated, we look at the next highest, which is item 1. However, item 1 might be more valuable to others, so we allocate item 0 since it has a comparable value.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 the highest, but since it's already allocated, we allocate item 1 as it has the next highest value for this agent.
5. **Remaining item 2**: This item is not yet allocated. Agent 0 values it highly, but since they already have item 3, we can consider giving the remaining item to Agent 3, who has a lower value but no other items are available.

After this allocation, the assignment looks like:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent gets the best possible value given the constraints.
