Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  28  68  31  44
1  47  55  45  31  32
2  44  43  65  75  41
3  33  15  52  41  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Optimal Allocations:**
   - Each agent should ideally receive items that they value the most.

2. **Greedy Approach for Allocation:**
   - Start by allocating the highest value item for each agent, if possible, without overlap.
   - If conflicts arise (i.e., multiple agents value the same item highly), consider the next best option for the involved agents and try to resolve by looking at the second-highest preferences.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - After initial allocation, check if any agent has not received an item and allocate remaining items based on highest available value.

Let's execute this plan:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value 68).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (value 55).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (value 75).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most (value 58).

After this initial allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 2
- Agent 1 gets item 1
- Agent 2 gets item 3
- Agent 3 gets item 4

The only item remaining is item 0. We will allocate it to the agent who values it the most among those who have received fewer items:
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 47, which is the highest among the agents.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1, 0]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [4]

In JSON format, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
