Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  86  69   3  75
1  92  75  48  47  16
2  55  38  58  25  93
3   3  67  98  11  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 3 67 98 11 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 61 (item 0), 86 (item 1), 69 (item 2), 3 (item 3), 75 (item 4)
- Agent 1 values: 92 (item 0), 75 (item 1), 48 (item 2), 47 (item 3), 16 (item 4)
- Agent 2 values: 55 (item 0), 38 (item 1), 58 (item 2), 25 (item 3), 93 (item 4)
- Agent 3 values: 3 (item 0), 67 (item 1), 98 (item 2), 11 (item 3), 57 (item 4)

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 2:** Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (98).
2. **Item 4:** Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (93).
3. **Item 0:** Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (92).
4. **Item 1:** Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (86).
5. **Item 3:** Remaining items must consider overall balance. Agent 1 can take Item 3 with a valuation of 47.

Now, let's consolidate these allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 2

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to the agent who values it most, while maintaining a fair distribution among the agents.
