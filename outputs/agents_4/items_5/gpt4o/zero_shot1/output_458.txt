Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  17  45  86  80
1  39  71   2  82  86
2  40  61   7  16  48
3  43  58  49   8   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 17 45 86 80]
 [39 71  2 82 86]
 [40 61  7 16 48]
 [43 58 49  8  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [63, 17, 45, 86, 80]
- Agent 1: [39, 71, 2, 82, 86]
- Agent 2: [40, 61, 7, 16, 48]
- Agent 3: [43, 58, 49, 8, 9]

We will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent and ensure that all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**
   - Highest value is for item 3 (86), followed by item 4 (80).

2. **Agent 1**
   - Highest value is for item 4 (86), followed by item 3 (82).

3. **Agent 2**
   - Highest value is for item 1 (61), followed by item 0 (40).

4. **Agent 3**
   - Highest value is for item 2 (49), followed by item 1 (58).

### Proposed Allocation

- Give **item 3** to **Agent 0** (value: 86).
- Give **item 4** to **Agent 1** (value: 86).
- Give **item 1** to **Agent 2** (value: 61).
- Give **item 0** to **Agent 3** (value: 43).
- **Item 2** remains, allocate to **Agent 3** (value: 49).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the items are allocated to maximize the agents' valuations.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their highest valuation preferences.
