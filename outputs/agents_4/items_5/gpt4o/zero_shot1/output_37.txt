Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  47   0  41   8
1  77  11   5  63  22
2  13  43  96  73  88
3  29  30  18   4  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation of the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify highest valuations for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 78.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 47.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 96.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 63.
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 88.

2. **Assign the highest valued items to agents:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it the highest and can take more than one item).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it the highest and can take more than one item).

3. **Ensure all agents are included, even if not allocated an item:**
   - Agent 3 does not receive any items in this allocation.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation maximizes overall satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that all items are allocated and all agents are considered.
