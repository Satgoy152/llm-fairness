Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  70   2  55  37
1  90  50  70  59  93
2  43  45  71   9  85
3  41   4  67  97  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[18 70  2 55 37]
 [90 50 70 59 93]
 [43 45 71  9 85]
 [41  4 67 97 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize fairness. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly, while trying to minimize disparity among agents in terms of total valuation.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (70) and item 3 (55) quite decently.
- Agent 1 values item 0 (90) and item 4 (93) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 2 (71) and item 4 (85) highly.
- Agent 3 values item 3 (97) highly.

Based on these observations, let's try to allocate the items:

- Give item 1 to agent 0, as it is the highest valued item for agent 0.
- Give item 0 to agent 1, as it is highly valued by agent 1.
- Give item 4 to agent 1, as it is the highest valued remaining item for agent 1.
- Give item 2 to agent 2, as it is highly valued by agent 2.
- Give item 3 to agent 3, as it is the highest valued item for agent 3.

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent's high-value items are prioritized.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
