Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  44   3  77  31
1  45  84  13  89  91
2  14  56   8  49  41
3   1  61  64  24   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll also ensure each item is allocated only once, and only 5 items are allocated in total.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

- Agent 0's highest value item is item 3 (77).
- Agent 1's highest value item is item 4 (91).
- Agent 2's highest value item is item 1 (56).
- Agent 3's highest value item is item 2 (64).

We'll start by assigning each agent their highest value item:

1. Agent 0 gets item 3.
2. Agent 1 gets item 4.
3. Agent 2 gets item 1.
4. Agent 3 gets item 2.

Now, we have assigned 4 items, and we have 1 more item left to allocate. The remaining item is item 0. Let's see who values it the most among the agents who haven't received their second item:

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 63.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 45.
- Agent 2 values item 0 at 14.
- Agent 3 values item 0 at 1.

Agent 0 values item 0 the highest. Therefore, we'll assign item 0 to Agent 0.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
