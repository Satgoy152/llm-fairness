Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  43  67  77  20
1  26  49  88  83  88
2  43  50  73  28  17
3   8  75  78  95  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since there are only 5 items and 4 agents, not every agent will necessarily receive an item. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 43. 
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 75.
   
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 88.
   
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 95.
   
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 88.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets a fair allocation. Since we have to distribute all 5 items in a manner that respects integer allocations and fairness, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item where possible, but given the constraint of 5 items, not every agent can receive one.

From the above initial allocation, Agent 0 has no items. We can adjust slightly to ensure they are also considered, though it may not always be possible to give every agent an item without reducing the total value. Let's maintain the highest valuations given:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 43).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 75).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 88).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 95).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 88).

This allocation maximizes the total value and respects the constraints. Agent 0 unfortunately receives no item based on the highest valuations, as redistributing items significantly reduces the total value each agent receives.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation provides the highest total value based on the given valuations while ensuring each item is allocated.
