Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  12  14  91  72
1  82  28  61  81  64
2  58  73  33  14  81
3  89   9   7  46  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 12 14 91 72]
 [82 28 61 81 64]
 [58 73 33 14 81]
 [89  9  7 46 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated. One way to approach this problem is to maximize the total valuation by assigning items to agents based on their highest preferences.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 should get item 3 because their valuation is 91, the highest among all items for Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 should get item 0 because their valuation is 82, the highest among all items for Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 should get item 4 because their valuation is 81, the highest among all items for Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 should get item 2 because their valuation is 7, the highest among all items for Agent 3.
5. Agent 3 should then get item 1 because their valuation is 9, and it is the only unallocated item left.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```
