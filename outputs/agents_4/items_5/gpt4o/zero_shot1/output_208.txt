Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  32   9  25  23
1  92  20  40   1  88
2  97  88  48  53  55
3   3  30  37  63  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 88 48 53 55]
 [ 3 30 37 63 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. Given the constraints, here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We will allocate items that provide the highest value to Agent 0 while considering other agents' needs. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (25), followed by item 4 (23).
   
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the most (92), and that would be a significant allocation for them. 

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the most (97), but since item 0 is already allocated, the next best is item 1 (88).

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 the most (75), followed by item 3 (63). However, item 4 is the highest remaining value that hasn't been allocated to another agent yet.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [4]
- The remaining item 2 should go to the agent with the next highest valuation for unallocated items, which is Agent 0 (9).

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations.
