Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  91  75  31  72
1  80  26  51  36  31
2  67  98  81  21  24
3  42  83  56  64  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it most, as long as that agent hasn't already reached the maximum number of items they can receive. Given there are 4 agents and 5 items, an equitable distribution would be for some agents to receive 1 item and others to receive 2 items. However, the exact distribution depends on the valuations.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. Item 0:  
   - Agent 1 values it at 80, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 1.

2. Item 1:  
   - Agent 2 values it at 98, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2.

3. Item 2:  
   - Agent 2 values it at 81, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 2. (Agent 2 now has 2 items.)

4. Item 3:  
   - Agent 3 values it at 64, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 3.

5. Item 4:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 72, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 0.

Now, each agent has been assigned their items based on their highest valuations, ensuring a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated based on the highest valuations, given the constraints of the problem.
