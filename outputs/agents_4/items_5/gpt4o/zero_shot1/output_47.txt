Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  45  70  89   6
1  28  17  83  90  83
2  68  94   3  38   0
3  35  21  99  77  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [68 94  3 38  0]
 [35 21 99 77 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all items being allocated.

Given the valuations, let's determine an optimal allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 3 (89).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 3 (90), but since Agent 0 also values item 3 highly, we can explore other options for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 1 (94).
4. **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 2 (99).

Following the valuations and considering maximizing the agent satisfaction:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (90).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (94).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (99).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (69).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (83).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
