Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  56  17  29  82
1  99  88  48   8  45
2  26  83  45  62  49
3  84  48  88  81  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[48 56 17 29 82]
 [99 88 48  8 45]
 [26 83 45 62 49]
 [84 48 88 81 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  56  17  29  82
1  99  88  48   8  45
2  26  83  45  62  49
3  84  48  88  81  45
```

We can use a greedy approach to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through each item:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 83.
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 88.
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 81.
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 82.

Now, let's allocate these items to the agents accordingly:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets items 2 and 3.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
