Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  67  65  82  38
1  60  28  41  46  75
2  36   8  65  63   8
3  88  40  16  89  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives the items they value the most, while maintaining a fair distribution of items across all agents.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Highest value is 82 for item 3.
   - Agent 1: Highest value is 75 for item 4.
   - Agent 2: Highest value is 65 for item 2.
   - Agent 3: Highest value is 89 for item 3.

2. **Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations without duplication:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 82).
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 75).
   - Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 65).
   - Agent 3 gets item 0 (value 88).

3. **Allocate the remaining item:**
   - The remaining item is item 1. Let's allocate it to the agent who values it the most and hasn't received their top-valued item:
     - Agent 0 values item 1 at 67, which is the highest remaining value for this item among the agents who have not been allocated their highest valued items.

4. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 3, 1
   - Agent 1: Item 4
   - Agent 2: Item 2
   - Agent 3: Item 0

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
