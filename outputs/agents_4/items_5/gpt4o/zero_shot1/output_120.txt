Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  83  71  21  83
1   5  91  60  86  51
2  63  43  86  98  61
3  18  30  80  28  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction or utility based on their valuations. We can achieve this by analyzing the valuation matrix and assigning items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and a total of 5 items are distributed.

Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 1 (91). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
2. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 2 (98). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
3. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 0 (83). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
4. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 2 (86). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
5. Item 0 can be assigned to Agent 2, who has the next highest valuation (63).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2, 3],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and exactly 5 items are allocated in total.
