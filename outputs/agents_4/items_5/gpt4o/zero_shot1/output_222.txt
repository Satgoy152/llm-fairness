Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  44  64  96  49
1  39  33  51  47   1
2  38  56   6  74  71
3   0  24   8  69  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations in the table, a possible fair allocation can be determined by maximizing the total value assigned to each agent. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the highest at 96.
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it at 51, which is relatively high compared to other agents' valuations for item 2.
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the highest at 71.
4. Assign item 1 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it at 56, which is higher than other agents' valuations for item 1.
5. Assign item 0 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it at 39, which is the highest valuation among agents for item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their preferences. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation distributes the items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent.
