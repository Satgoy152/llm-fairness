Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  84  64  57  97
1  60  14  24  21  87
2  60  17   5  65  86
3  12  88  85  38  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[80 84 64 57 97]
 [60 14 24 21 87]
 [60 17  5 65 86]
 [12 88 85 38 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy based on the provided valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for item 0 and item 4.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.

Considering the above points, I will assign the items as follows:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Assign items 1 and 2 to agent 3.

This allocation gives each agent the maximum possible value from the items they receive while ensuring each item is allocated exactly once. Below is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
