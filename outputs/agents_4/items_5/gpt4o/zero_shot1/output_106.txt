Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  88  79  83  61
1  11  64  42   1  72
2  42  53  50  61  88
3  11   4  79  43  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as it results in a fair distribution.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Let's allocate the items based on the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (74).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (88).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (79).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (83).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (88).

Initially, this allocation gives all items to Agent 0 and one item to Agent 2, which is not fair for Agents 1 and 3. We need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness:

Revised allocation:
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the second most after Agent 0.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 values it the second most after Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 still needs fair allocation).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items is five.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are fairly distributed based on the agents' valuations.
