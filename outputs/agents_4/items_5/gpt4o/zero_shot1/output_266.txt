Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  55  96  69   8
1  65  77  61  58  99
2  32  41  61  68  88
3  40  63  24  97  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 65
   - Agent 2 values it at 32
   - Agent 3 values it at 40
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 96)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 55
   - Agent 1 values it at 77
   - Agent 2 values it at 41
   - Agent 3 values it at 63
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 77)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 61
   - Agent 2 values it at 61
   - Agent 3 values it at 24
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 96)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 69
   - Agent 1 values it at 58
   - Agent 2 values it at 68
   - Agent 3 values it at 97
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (highest value: 97)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 8
   - Agent 1 values it at 99
   - Agent 2 values it at 88
   - Agent 3 values it at 49
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 99)

The allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: Item [3]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3]
}
```
