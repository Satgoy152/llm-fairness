Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91   7  34  41  63
1  17   6  11  15  22
2  57  91  18  12  12
3  43  51  39  60  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [57 91 18 12 12]
 [43 51 39 60 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 0 (91).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 4 (22).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 1 (91).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 3 (60).

Now, only item 2 remains unallocated. Let's distribute it based on remaining valuations:
- Agent 0 has a valuation of 34 for item 2.
- Agent 1 has a valuation of 11 for item 2.
- Agent 2 has a valuation of 18 for item 2.
- Agent 3 has a valuation of 39 for item 2.

Agent 3 has the highest remaining valuation for item 2. Thus, item 2 is allocated to agent 3.

The final allocations based on these decisions are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```
