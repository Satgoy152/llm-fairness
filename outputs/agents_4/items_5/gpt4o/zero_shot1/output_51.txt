Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  73   0  39  72
1   8  79  52  25   6
2  39  58  12  18  82
3  21  65   6  76  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [21 65  6 76 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction (or value) of each agent given the constraints. Each agent can receive one or more items, but each item can only be assigned to one agent.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value: Item 0 (93)
   - Second highest value: Item 1 (73)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value: Item 1 (79)
   - Second highest value: Item 2 (52)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value: Item 4 (82)
   - Second highest value: Item 1 (58)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value: Item 3 (76)
   - Second highest value: Item 1 (65)

Considering the above, let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's highest values, ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value = 93 for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (value = 79 for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (value = 82 for Agent 2)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 (value = 76 for Agent 3)

This leaves Item 2, which can be assigned to Agent 1 as they have the next highest value for it (52).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
