Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  83  72  93  83
1   3  52  16  12  66
2   8  26  77  38   1
3  95  10  42   0  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 10 42  0 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or total value each agent gets from the items they receive. Here's a possible fair allocation based on maximizing each agent's total value:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: 3 (value 93)
   - Next highest: 1 (value 83)
   - Total value: 176

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: 4 (value 66)
   - Total value: 66

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: 2 (value 77)
   - Total value: 77

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item: 0 (value 95)
   - Total value: 95

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value most highly, given the constraint of only 5 items in total. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
