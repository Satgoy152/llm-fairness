Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  80  45  85  82
1  39   7  59  39  31
2  33  94  37  25  29
3  87  96  97  16  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 80 45 85 82]
 [39  7 59 39 31]
 [33 94 37 25 29]
 [87 96 97 16 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuation table and allocate the items accordingly.

### Valuations Table:
```
      0   1   2   3   4
0  83  80  45  85  82
1  39   7  59  39  31
2  33  94  37  25  29
3  87  96  97  16  99
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 3** has the highest values for several items. Prioritize items based on the highest valuation:
   - Item 4 (Value = 99)
   - Item 2 (Value = 97)
   - Item 1 (Value = 96)
   
   Assign items 4, 2, and 1 to Agent 3.

2. **Agent 0** has high valuations for the remaining items:
   - Item 3 (Value = 85)
   
   Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 2** has the next highest valuation:
   - Item 0 (Value = 33)
   
   Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 1** receives no items due to lower valuations compared to other agents.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing their total valuations based on the given table.
