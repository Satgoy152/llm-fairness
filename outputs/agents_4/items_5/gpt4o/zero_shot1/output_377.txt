Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  90  90  22   6
1   2   5  52  60  28
2  10  81  61  24  20
3  22   4  27   6  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [22  4 27  6 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction across all agents by assigning items based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the table and derive an allocation:

Agent 0:
- Highest valuations: Item 1 (90), Item 2 (90)

Agent 1:
- Highest valuations: Item 3 (60), Item 2 (52)

Agent 2:
- Highest valuations: Item 1 (81), Item 2 (61)

Agent 3:
- Highest valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 2 (27)

Let's assign items to maximize their overall satisfaction:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because it's among the highest for Agent 0 and removes one top choice from Agent 2.
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 because it's their highest valuation.
3. Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 because it's their highest valuation.
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 because it is the next highest available item for Agent 2.

Now, we have assigned 4 items, and we need to allocate 1 more item:

5. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because it is their third-highest valuation, and we can ensure Agent 0 receives at least two items.

By this allocation, each agent receives items they value highly, and all 5 items are distributed.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
