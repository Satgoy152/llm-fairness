Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  74  36   4  55
1  56  19  67  65  29
2  95  85  64  49  23
3  27  16   8   9  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple algorithm: assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's go through the table, item by item, to determine which agent values each item the most:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 69
  - Agent 1 values it at 56
  - Agent 2 values it at 95 (highest)
  - Agent 3 values it at 27
  
  Item 0 goes to Agent 2.

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 74 (highest)
  - Agent 1 values it at 19
  - Agent 2 values it at 85 (highest)
  - Agent 3 values it at 16
  
  Item 1 goes to Agent 2.

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 36
  - Agent 1 values it at 67 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 64
  - Agent 3 values it at 8
  
  Item 2 goes to Agent 1.

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 4
  - Agent 1 values it at 65 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 49
  - Agent 3 values it at 9
  
  Item 3 goes to Agent 1.

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 55 (highest)
  - Agent 1 values it at 29
  - Agent 2 values it at 23
  - Agent 3 values it at 17
  
  Item 4 goes to Agent 0.

After this allocation, each agent receives the following items:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: no items

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": []
}
```
