Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  24  52  91  88
1  50   9  71  72  85
2  40  66  10  12  15
3  84  30  88   7  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, I will try to maximize the total valuations for each agent by ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items based on their preferences. We have 5 items to allocate among 4 agents, meaning one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one item each. Here's a fair allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 3. 
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 and second-highest for item 4.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these valuations:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Since Agent 3 has already been assigned an item (item 0), and they have the next highest valuation for item 4, assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
