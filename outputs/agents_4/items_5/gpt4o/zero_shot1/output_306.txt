Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  84  16  98  95
1  93  56  52  56  74
2   8  24  38  46  83
3  40  26  25  84  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 26 25 84 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering the valuations and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for all agents or aims to balance the values received by each agent. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it highly (93) compared to other agents.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it highly (84).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3 because agent 3 has the highest value for it (25).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the most (98).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the most (83).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the overall distribution of values is reasonable. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
