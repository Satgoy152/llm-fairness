Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  80  22  54  81
1  51  41  28  74  98
2  43  39  82  72  81
3  55   9   5  12  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 80 22 54 81]
 [51 41 28 74 98]
 [43 39 82 72 81]
 [55  9  5 12 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total utility across all agents, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We can achieve this by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the items.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 4.
- Agent 3 has relatively low valuations overall, but item 0 is the highest among them.

To ensure fairness and maximize individual satisfaction, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation by Agent 0).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation by Agent 0).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation by Agent 2).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation by Agent 1).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation by Agent 1, since Agent 2 already has item 2).

Agent 3 will not receive any items due to their relatively low valuations compared to other agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": []
}
```
