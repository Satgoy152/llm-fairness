Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  19  40  17  54
1  75  21   2  83   5
2  75  29  11  99  19
3  53  10  67  89  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach. One way is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. We will ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

To achieve this, let's look at the valuations and assign each item to the agent with the highest value for that item:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 16
  - Agent 1 values it at 75
  - Agent 2 values it at 75
  - Agent 3 values it at 53
  - Both Agent 1 and Agent 2 have the highest valuation (75), so let's assign it to Agent 1 (or Agent 2 if needed for balance).

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 19
  - Agent 1 values it at 21
  - Agent 2 values it at 29
  - Agent 3 values it at 10
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation (29).

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 40
  - Agent 1 values it at 2
  - Agent 2 values it at 11
  - Agent 3 values it at 67
  - Agent 3 has the highest valuation (67).

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 17
  - Agent 1 values it at 83
  - Agent 2 values it at 99
  - Agent 3 values it at 89
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation (99).

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 54
  - Agent 1 values it at 5
  - Agent 2 values it at 19
  - Agent 3 values it at 83
  - Agent 3 has the highest valuation (83).

Now, let's check the allocations:
- Agent 0: No items
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
