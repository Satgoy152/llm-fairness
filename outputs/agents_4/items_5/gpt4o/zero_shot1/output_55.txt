Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  33  47  98  78
1  78   8  12  96  43
2  86  26  62  23  57
3   2  39  52  75  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed. We also aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. A common approach to this problem is to use a method similar to the "Maximum Weighted Matching" in a bipartite graph, but for simplicity, let's try to assign items based on each agent's highest valuation preferences. 

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 (value = 98). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest available value for Agent 1 is item 0 (value = 78). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest available value for Agent 2 is item 2 (value = 62). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest available value for Agent 3 is item 4 (value = 98). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Remaining Item (1)**: At this point, item 1 is left. Agent 0 has the second-highest valuation for item 1 (value = 33), after Agent 3 (value = 39), but since Agent 3 already has item 4, we look for the next best option to maintain fairness. Assign item 1 to Agent 3, as they have a higher valuation than Agent 0.

Thus, the allocations will be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and that the overall distribution is based on their preferences as much as possible.
