Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  42  88  37  78
1  19  85  17  44  66
2  16  13  20  39  21
3  43  35  44  16   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common strategy for this type of problem is to use a greedy algorithm, where we allocate items to the agent that values them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's break down the valuations and allocate items step by step:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 43.
   - Allocation: Agent 3 -> Item 0

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 85.
   - Allocation: Agent 1 -> Item 1

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 88.
   - Allocation: Agent 0 -> Item 2

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 2 values it at the highest remaining value of 39.
   - Allocation: Agent 2 -> Item 3

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest remaining value for it at 78.
   - Allocation: Agent 0 -> Item 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is distributed, and the agents receive items based on their highest valuations.
