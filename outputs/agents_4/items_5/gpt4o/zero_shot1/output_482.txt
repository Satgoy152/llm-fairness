Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  48  95  98   3
1  61  38  35  95  96
2  67   6  32  69  40
3  19  95  33  59  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both the preferences and the total number of items available. Each agent must get an integer number of items, and there are 5 items to allocate in total. We'll aim to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest value: Item 3 (98)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest value: Item 4 (96)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (67)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (95)

Based on these preferences, we can start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 3

Now, we have one item left: Item 2.

Let's look at the agents' preferences for Item 2:

- Agent 0: 95
- Agent 1: 35
- Agent 2: 32
- Agent 3: 33

Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest. Thus, we assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest preferences while distributing all 5 items.
