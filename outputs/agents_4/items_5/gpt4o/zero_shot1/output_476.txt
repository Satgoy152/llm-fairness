Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  87  48  86  28
1  54  92  80  71  49
2  49  59  69  11  69
3  14  13  23  60  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy approach to maximize the total value each agent receives. We aim to assign items to agents such that the sum of the agents' valuations for the items they receive is maximized.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. List all possible allocations and their corresponding valuations.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring no agent receives more than one item until all agents have at least one or all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given table:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 at 54, Agent 2 at 49, Agent 3 at 14. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 at 92, Agent 2 at 59, Agent 3 at 13. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 48, Agent 1 at 80, Agent 2 at 69, Agent 3 at 23. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 71, Agent 2 at 11, Agent 3 at 60. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 at 49, Agent 2 at 69, Agent 3 at 85. Assign to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the final allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
