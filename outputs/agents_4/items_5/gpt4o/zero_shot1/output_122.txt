Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  97  47  86  13
1   0  22  90   2  18
2  87  47  70  38  26
3   0  45  10  26  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we want to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate items such that the total value received by each agent is maximized according to their preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Look for each agent's most valued items to ensure they get what they value highly.

2. **Assign Items Based on Maximum Valuation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no item is assigned to more than one agent.

3. **Check for Fair Distribution:**
   - Ensure that the allocation is fair. If one agent gets significantly more value than others, consider redistributing items.

4. **Adjust As Needed:**
   - If an agent ends up with too many items, redistribute them to agents who have fewer or no items.

Let's implement this allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 1 highly with a value of 97.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 2 highly with a value of 90.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 0 highly with a value of 87.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 4 highly with a value of 92.

Now allocate the remaining item:

- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 86, which is the highest among the agents. 

Based on these preferences and ensuring that each agent receives items and the allocation is fair, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5, with each agent receiving the items they value the most.
