Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  83  52   6  77
1  13  39  30  13  50
2  10  34  93  65   7
3  77  79  78  47  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. This is often referred to as maximizing the social welfare.

Let's start by evaluating the valuations of each agent for the items and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here are the valuations:
- Agent 0: [59, 83, 52, 6, 77]
- Agent 1: [13, 39, 30, 13, 50]
- Agent 2: [10, 34, 93, 65, 7]
- Agent 3: [77, 79, 78, 47, 11]

Let's allocate the items to the agents based on their highest valuations:

1. **Item 0:** The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (77).
2. **Item 1:** The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (83).
3. **Item 2:** The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (93).
4. **Item 3:** The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (65).
5. **Item 4:** The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (77).

Now let's assign these items to the agents:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: No items (minimum valuation across all items)
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3
- Agent 3: Item 0

Each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that items are distributed in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their highest valuations.
