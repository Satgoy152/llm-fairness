Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  46  41  97  60
1  51  16  20  97   6
2  46   2  80  10  82
3   2  12  76  60   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's break down the allocation process for each item based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 40.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 51.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 at 46.
   - Agent 3 values item 0 at 2.
   - **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 46.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 16.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 at 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 1 at 12.
   - **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 41.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 20.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 at 80.
   - Agent 3 values item 2 at 76.
   - **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 97.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 97.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 at 10.
   - Agent 3 values item 3 at 60.
   - **Agent 0** and **Agent 1** both value item 3 equally. In case of a tie, we can allocate it to either agent. Let's allocate it to **Agent 0**.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 60.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 6.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 at 82.
   - Agent 3 values item 4 at 3.
   - **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4.

With this allocation, each agent receives the items they value the most, and all items are fairly distributed. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": []
}
```
