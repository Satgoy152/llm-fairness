Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  83  94   2  54
1  50   0  54  58   2
2  35  37  61  77  81
3  36  44   7  16  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuation of the items. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **List the values for each item by agent:**
   - Item 0: [29, 50, 35, 36]
   - Item 1: [83, 0, 37, 44]
   - Item 2: [94, 54, 61, 7]
   - Item 3: [2, 58, 77, 16]
   - Item 4: [54, 2, 81, 63]

2. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (value 50)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 83)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (value 94)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (value 77)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (value 81)

3. **Ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item if possible:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 2
   - Agent 1: Item 0
   - Agent 2: Items 3, 4
   - Agent 3: No items, since all items are already allocated

4. **Check allocations:**
   - Total items allocated: 5
   - Each item is allocated to exactly one agent

5. **Present the allocations in the requested JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": []
}
```
