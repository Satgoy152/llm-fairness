Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  60  52  53  30
1   9  70   5  56  76
2  53   2  86  83  65
3   2  57  57  64  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 9 60 52 53 30]
 [ 9 70  5 56 76]
 [53  2 86 83 65]
 [ 2 57 57 64 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [9, 60, 52, 53, 30]
Agent 1: [9, 70, 5, 56, 76]
Agent 2: [53, 2, 86, 83, 65]
Agent 3: [2, 57, 57, 64, 87]
```

Let's take a strategic approach to maximize the sum of each agent's allocated values:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 1 (60).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 4 (76).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 2 (86).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 3 (64).

Now, let's allocate based on these evaluations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

This leaves item 0 unallocated. We need to assign it to one of the agents to complete the allocation. Since Agent 2 and Agent 3 have relatively high values for item 0 compared to their other allocations, it would be reasonable to allocate item 0 to Agent 2, who values it at 53.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
