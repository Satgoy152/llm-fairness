Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  68  43  85  24
1  19  12  96  27   6
2   6  66   4  88  47
3  62  24  35  23  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items to the 4 agents, we can look at the valuations provided by each agent for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction or utility. We'll consider a simple allocation strategy based on each agent's highest valuation for an item, ensuring that each item is only allocated once and each agent can receive at least one item if possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 96.
2. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 88.
3. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 62.
4. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 68.
5. The remaining item 4 can be allocated to Agent 3, who values it at 36, which is higher than the other agents' valuations for this item.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item if possible, maximizing the overall satisfaction:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This distribution attempts to ensure each agent gets an item they value highly.
