Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38   1  21  10  96
1  66  46  48  43   7
2  45  22  90  37  73
3   4  99  80  38  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider maximizing the overall valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's follow a step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:**  
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 66.
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 99.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 90.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 10.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 96.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:**  
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

3. **Remaining item allocation:**  
   - Item 3: Can be assigned to Agent 0 since it's the highest valuation for the remaining item and Agent 0 only has one item so far.

4. **Ensure fair distribution:**  
   After these allocations, all agents receive at least one item. Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an item.
