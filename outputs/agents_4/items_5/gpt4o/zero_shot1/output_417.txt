Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  67  13   4  67
1  19  14  90  83  42
2  66  22  84   3  10
3   5  83  19   3  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's use a simple greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest value each agent places on the items. This type of allocation typically involves assigning each item to the agent who values it most, one by one, while ensuring no agent gets more than one item until all agents have had their turn, if possible. Here's how we can do it:

1. Create a list of all items and their respective values for each agent.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on the value.
3. Allocate items to agents based on the sorted list, ensuring each agent gets an item in turn until all items are allocated.

Let's perform these steps:

1. Create a list of (agent, item, value) tuples:
   ```
   [(0, 0, 15), (0, 1, 67), (0, 2, 13), (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 67),
    (1, 0, 19), (1, 1, 14), (1, 2, 90), (1, 3, 83), (1, 4, 42),
    (2, 0, 66), (2, 1, 22), (2, 2, 84), (2, 3, 3), (2, 4, 10),
    (3, 0, 5), (3, 1, 83), (3, 2, 19), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 60)]
   ```

2. Sort by value in descending order:
   ```
   [(1, 2, 90), (2, 2, 84), (1, 3, 83), (3, 1, 83), (0, 1, 67), 
    (0, 4, 67), (2, 0, 66), (1, 4, 42), (2, 1, 22), (3, 4, 60), 
    (1, 0, 19), (2, 3, 3), (0, 2, 13), (1, 1, 14), (0, 0, 15), 
    (3, 0, 5), (2, 4, 10), (0, 3, 4), (3, 2, 19), (3, 3, 3)]
   ```

3. Allocate items to agents ensuring each agent gets a turn:
   ```
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (value 90)
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 2 (value 84)
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 3 (value 83)
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2 (value 66)
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0 (value 67)
   ```

4. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation assumes each agent gets the highest value item available to them in turn, ensuring fairness and maximizing overall satisfaction. Note that agent 3 ends up with 2 items due to the distribution of values.
