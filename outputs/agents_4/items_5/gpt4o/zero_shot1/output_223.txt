Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  28  52  14  19
1  14  89  82  97  20
2  79  91  37  76  65
3  99   5  74  31  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[69 28 52 14 19]
 [14 89 82 97 20]
 [79 91 37 76 65]
 [99  5 74 31 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations such that every agent receives a reasonable allocation based on their preferences. We aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 69     | 28     | 52     | 14     | 19     |
| 1     | 14     | 89     | 82     | 97     | 20     |
| 2     | 79     | 91     | 37     | 76     | 65     |
| 3     | 99     | 5      | 74     | 31     | 87     |

Let's prioritize allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations to maximize the total value.

1. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 99. Assign item 0 to agent 3.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 97. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 91. Assign item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4 at 87. Assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. Finally, item 2 can be allocated to agent 1, who values it at 82, which is also quite high.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent has a fair chance to receive items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
