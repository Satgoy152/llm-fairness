Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  13  11  16  75
1  13  33  41  93  86
2  75  89  76  73  81
3  12  87  24  25  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we'll use the concept of maximizing total utility by assigning items to the agent that values them the most while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (75)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (89)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (41)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (93)
   - Item 4: Agent 3 (88)

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
   - Agent 0: []
   - Agent 1: [2, 3]
   - Agent 2: [0, 1]
   - Agent 3: [4]

3. **Adjust to Ensure Each Agent Gets at Least One Item:**
   - Currently, Agent 0 has no items. We need to reassign one item from another agent to Agent 0 while keeping the total value distribution as fair as possible.
   - Reassign Item 0 from Agent 2 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it (60).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0]
   - Agent 1: [2, 3]
   - Agent 2: [1]
   - Agent 3: [4]

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
