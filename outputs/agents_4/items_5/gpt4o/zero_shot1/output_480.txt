Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  85  75  49  35
1  38  61   6  46  41
2  44   4  28  36  72
3  66  35  58  31  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 85 75 49 35]
 [38 61  6 46 41]
 [44  4 28 36 72]
 [66 35 58 31 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to try to maximize the total value or to ensure each agent receives at least one item they value highly.

Considering the valuations given in the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  85  75  49  35
1  38  61   6  46  41
2  44   4  28  36  72
3  66  35  58  31  23
```

One possible fair allocation could consider giving each agent an item they value highly, ensuring both fairness and efficiency. Here's a suggested allocation:

- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 85).
- Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 72).
- Assign item 0 to agent 3 (value 66).
- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 46).
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 75).

This allocation maximizes the total value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item they value. Now, let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
