Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  92  55  85  46
1  16  66  66  57  28
2   8  74  46  30  85
3  97   6  98  55  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 74 46 30 85]
 [97  6 98 55 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 5 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  92  55  85  46
1  16  66  66  57  28
2   8  74  46  30  85
3  97   6  98  55  92
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Identify the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents based on highest valuations without overlap.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuation is for item 0 (94).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 2 (66).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 4 (85).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuation is for item 2 (98), but it's already taken by Agent 1. Next highest is item 0 (97), but it's already taken by Agent 0. Allocate item 3 (55).

At this stage:
- Agent 0 has item 0.
- Agent 1 has item 2.
- Agent 2 has item 4.
- Agent 3 has item 3.

The remaining item is item 1. Let's allocate it to the agent who values it the most among those who have not already received an item:
- Agent 0 values item 1 at 92, which is the highest remaining valuation.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly based on the highest valuations while respecting the requirement that each agent can get an integer number of items.
