Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81   0  93   6  75
1  79  57  31  71   7
2  55  19  44   1  34
3  59  51  45  84  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81  0 93  6 75]
 [79 57 31 71  7]
 [55 19 44  1 34]
 [59 51 45 84 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the highest valuations each agent has for different items. Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

```
Agent 0: Values = [81, 0, 93, 6, 75]
Agent 1: Values = [79, 57, 31, 71, 7]
Agent 2: Values = [55, 19, 44, 1, 34]
Agent 3: Values = [59, 51, 45, 84, 85]
```

To allocate fairly, we can assign items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. **Item 0:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (81)
2. **Item 1:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (57)
3. **Item 2:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (93)
4. **Item 3:** Highest valuation by Agent 3 (84)
5. **Item 4:** Highest valuation by Agent 3 (85)

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets no items.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 4.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
