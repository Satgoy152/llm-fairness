Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  84  30  43  59
1   0  20  53  75  72
2   3  44  24  15  46
3  39  63  65  64  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 9 84 30 43 59]
 [ 0 20 53 75 72]
 [ 3 44 24 15 46]
 [39 63 65 64 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  84  30  43  59
1   0  20  53  75  72
2   3  44  24  15  46
3  39  63  65  64  65
```

Let's determine an allocation that attempts to be fair:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (84).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (75).
3. **Agent 2** has relatively lower values but prefers item 4 (46).
4. **Agent 3** values items 2, 3, and 4 highly, but prefers item 2 (65).

Considering these preferences, we try to allocate the items as follows:

- **Item 1** to Agent 0
- **Item 3** to Agent 1
- **Item 4** to Agent 2
- **Item 0** to Agent 3
- **Item 2** to Agent 3

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes individual agent satisfaction based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
