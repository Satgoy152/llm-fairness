Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  35  50   5  63
1  79  84  28  84  22
2  43  79  24  74  53
3   8  28   7  47  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a variant of the Hungarian algorithm, which is typically used for assignment problems. However, since there are only 5 items and 4 agents, we can manually inspect potential allocations to ensure fairness and maximize the total value.

Let's examine possible allocations:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 1.
   - Agent 3 values item 4 the most.

2. **Allocate Strategically:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 since it has the highest value for that agent (63).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 as it has a high value (79).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 as it has a high value (79).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3 as it has the highest value for that agent (47).
   - Assign item 2 to the remaining agent with the next highest valuation, which is Agent 0 with a value of 50.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 4
   - Agent 1: Item 0
   - Agent 2: Item 1
   - Agent 3: Item 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated while maximizing the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.
