Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  39  67  25  11
1  24  92  23  65  93
2  89  59  57  66  21
3  34  29  11  40  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 92 23 65 93]
 [89 59 57 66 21]
 [34 29 11 40 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will try to maximize the total valuation sum for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0 (67).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 1 (93).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2 (89).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 3 (40).

This leaves Item 1 unallocated. Let's allocate it based on maximizing the satisfaction:
- Agent 1 values Item 1 the most at 92.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, maximizing individual agent satisfaction based on their highest valuations, and only 5 items are allocated in total.
