Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  85  51  43  51
1  37  21  50  64  47
2  18  40  81  11  55
3  30   7  75  90  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. We will try to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, while making sure that all items are distributed.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 1 the highest, so we assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, so we assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the highest, so we assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 the highest, so we assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. We still have item 0 left. It is best to assign this to the agent who values it most among those who haven't received their top choice or can gain more satisfaction. Agent 0 values it the most, so we assign item 0 to agent 0.

Now, let's summarize this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items that they value highly, and all items are distributed among the agents.
