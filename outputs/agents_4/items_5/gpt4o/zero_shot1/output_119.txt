Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  19  94  79  71
1  69  35  97  59  65
2  51  86   7  22  15
3  53  84  37  66  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 7 19 94 79 71]
 [69 35 97 59 65]
 [51 86  7 22 15]
 [53 84 37 66 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction by considering the valuations provided. Let's prioritize assigning items to agents based on the highest valuations for those items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Item 2 has the highest valuation by agent 1 (97). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
2. Item 3 has the highest valuation by agent 3 (66). Assign item 3 to agent 3.
3. Item 4 has the highest valuation by agent 3 (94). Assign item 4 to agent 3.
4. Item 1 has the highest valuation by agent 2 (86). Assign item 1 to agent 2.
5. Item 0 has the highest valuation by agent 1 (69). Assign item 0 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, and the assignments are based on maximizing the total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives all items to agents in a way that considers their highest valuation preferences, while ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent.
