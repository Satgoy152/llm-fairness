Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  17  24  32  42
1  62   4  92  26   3
2  79  86   9  47  14
3  51  25  62  32  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 2 17 24 32 42]
 [62  4 92 26  3]
 [79 86  9 47 14]
 [51 25 62 32 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's examine the valuations and attempt an optimal allocation:

```
Valuation Table:
Agent 0: 2, 17, 24, 32, 42
Agent 1: 62, 4, 92, 26, 3
Agent 2: 79, 86, 9, 47, 14
Agent 3: 51, 25, 62, 32, 36
```

The goal is to give each agent a fair share, ensuring that total item allocations equal 5 items, with each item going to one agent only.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (42).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (92).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 1 (86).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 0 (51).

This allocation leaves item 3 unallocated. Let's look for the next highest valuation for item 3:

- Agent 0 values item 3 at 32.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 26.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 47.
- Agent 3 values item 3 at 32.

Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 among the remaining options.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [4]
- **Agent 1**: [2]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 3]
- **Agent 3**: [0]

Now, let's present this in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
