Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  45   3  68  83
1  70  22  91   4   6
2  15  24  49  71  21
3   5  22  71  84   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 45  3 68 83]
 [70 22 91  4  6]
 [15 24 49 71 21]
 [ 5 22 71 84  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction. Given the table, we need to assign each item to an agent such that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [8, 45, 3, 68, 83]
- Agent 1: [70, 22, 91, 4, 6]
- Agent 2: [15, 24, 49, 71, 21]
- Agent 3: [5, 22, 71, 84, 6]

Let's start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no item is assigned twice.

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most with a valuation of 83.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 91.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 71.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 84, but since item 3 is already taken by agent 2, we assign agent 3 their next highest valued item, which is item 2 with a valuation of 71. However, item 2 is already allocated to agent 1, so we assign agent 3 item 1 instead, which has a valuation of 22.

At this point, we have:

- Agent 0: item 4
- Agent 1: item 2
- Agent 2: item 3
- Agent 3: item 1

Item 0 is the only unallocated item left, and we need to assign it to one of the agents. We look at who values it the most among those who might benefit from another item:

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 8.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 70.
- Agent 2 values item 0 at 15.
- Agent 3 values item 0 at 5.

Agent 1 values item 0 the highest with a valuation of 70, so we assign item 0 to agent 1.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: item 4
- Agent 1: items 2, 0
- Agent 2: item 3
- Agent 3: item 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
