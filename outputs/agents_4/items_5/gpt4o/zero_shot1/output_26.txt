Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  73  57  23  18
1  48  50  83  55  92
2  97  50  39  52  79
3  71  12  56  42  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 50 39 52 79]
 [71 12 56 42 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent gets, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. We will use the provided valuation table to guide our allocation:

```
Agent 0: [16, 73, 57, 23, 18]
Agent 1: [48, 50, 83, 55, 92]
Agent 2: [97, 50, 39, 52, 79]
Agent 3: [71, 12, 56, 42, 56]
```

To allocate the items fairly, one possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's apply this strategy:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (97).
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (73).
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (83).
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (55).
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (92).

Now let's distribute these items:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets no items.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item or the maximum they can get based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives the items that maximize their individual valuations.
