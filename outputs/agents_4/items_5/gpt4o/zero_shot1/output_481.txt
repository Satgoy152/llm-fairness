Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  82  40  42   7
1   6  67  52  44  86
2  61  30  96  67  29
3  99  27   0  30  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the sum of valuations for the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use the "Hungarian algorithm" for the assignment problem, which finds the maximum weight matching in a weighted bipartite graph. However, given the small size of this problem and the requirement for integer allocations, we can manually assign the items to optimize the total value.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (82)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (86)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (96)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (99)

From the above, each agent has received their highest valued item, and we have one item left to allocate (Item 3).

5. **Remaining item (Item 3)**:
   - Agent 2 values Item 3 at 67
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 at 44
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 42
   - Agent 3 values Item 3 at 30

The highest value for the remaining item is with Agent 2. Thus, we allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, let's create the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.
