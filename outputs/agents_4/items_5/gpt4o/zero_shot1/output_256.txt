Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9   6   3  31  42
1  64  31  70  23  49
2  44  82  79  66  82
3  30  11  12  67  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 82 79 66 82]
 [30 11 12 67 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (as there are fewer items than agents, not all agents can receive items, but we will ensure fairness by considering the highest valuations).

Here are the steps and reasoning for allocating the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Their highest valued item is 4 (value 42), followed by item 3 (value 31).
2. **Agent 1:** Their highest valued item is 2 (value 70), followed by item 4 (value 49).
3. **Agent 2:** Their highest valued item is 1 and 4 (both value 82).
4. **Agent 3:** Their highest valued item is 4 (value 90), followed by item 3 (value 67).

Using a fair approach, we allocate based on the highest valuations for each item:

- Item 0 to Agent 1 (valued at 64, highest among all agents).
- Item 1 to Agent 2 (valued at 82, highest among all agents).
- Item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 70, highest among all agents).
- Item 3 to Agent 3 (valued at 67, highest among all agents after item 4 is taken).
- Item 4 to Agent 3 (valued at 90, highest among all agents).

Given that we only have 5 items to allocate, we need to ensure that each allocation maximizes the total value for the agents who get items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, maximizing the total valuation received by each agent who receives items.
