Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88   6  84  84  35
1  92  83  36  36   3
2  61  33  43  56  41
3  87  94  78  19   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88  6 84 84 35]
 [92 83 36 36  3]
 [61 33 43 56 41]
 [87 94 78 19  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is a step-by-step thought process for this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is for item 0 (88), item 2 (84), and item 3 (84). 
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value is for item 0 (92) and item 1 (83).
   - Item 0 is already taken. Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is for item 3 (56) and item 2 (43).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value is for item 1 (94) and item 2 (78).
   - Item 1 is taken. Allocate item 2 to agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 4 is left.
   - Agent 2 has the highest value for item 4 (41) compared to others.

After this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
