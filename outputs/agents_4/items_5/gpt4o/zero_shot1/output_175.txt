Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  16  75  96  23
1  56   4   7  18  77
2   3  42   2  11   8
3  86  23  53  94  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 42  2 11  8]
 [86 23 53 94 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that the allocation is as fair as possible in terms of total value received.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  16  75  96  23
1  56   4   7  18  77
2   3  42   2  11   8
3  86  23  53  94  75
```

A possible allocation strategy could be as follows:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3. We should consider assigning one of these high-value items to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4. Assigning this item to agent 1 maximizes their value.
3. Agent 2 has their highest valuation for item 1. Assigning this item to agent 2 maximizes their value.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4. We need to choose items that balance the overall allocation.

Following these considerations, here is one possible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item and that the overall value is maximized for each agent based on their highest preferences.

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation uses all 5 items and ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
