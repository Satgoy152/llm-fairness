Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11   9  92  69  76
1   9  50  66  35  78
2  99  91  75  92  87
3  93  33  68   3  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [93 33 68  3 87]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives given their individual valuations. One common method for such allocations is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 99 by Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 91 by Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 92 by Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 92 by Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 87, and both Agent 2 and Agent 3 value it equally. However, since Agent 2 already has 3 items, it might be fairer to give this item to Agent 3, who highly values it and hasn't received any items yet.

Based on this allocation strategy, here is the distribution of items:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
