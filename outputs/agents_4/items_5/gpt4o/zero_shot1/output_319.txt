Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  21  15  27   8
1  72  87  37  10  22
2  88  64  32  13  73
3   0  23  21   9  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 64 32 13 73]
 [ 0 23 21  9 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will end up with 2 items, while the others will get 1 item each.

First, let's examine the highest valuations each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 28.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 87.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 88.
- Agent 3 values item 1 at 23 and item 4 at 23, with the same highest valuation for both.

Now, let's allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's valuation:

1. **Agent 2**: Assign item 0 (value 88) to Agent 2, as this is the highest valuation any agent has for any single item.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (value 87) to Agent 1, as this is the highest remaining valuation.
3. **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 (value 23) to Agent 3. Although Agent 3 values items 1 and 4 equally at 23, item 1 is already assigned. 
4. **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (value 27) to Agent 0, as this is their highest remaining valuation.
5. **Agent 1**: After assigning one item to each agent, one item remains unallocated. Assign item 2 (value 37) to Agent 1, since Agent 1 has a significant valuation for it, and it optimizes their utility further.

The allocations are thus:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the total value received by the agents.
