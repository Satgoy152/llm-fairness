Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11   6  27  53  66
1   6  88  46  40  47
2  52  62  90  54  84
3  55  50  16  42  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 88 46 40 47]
 [52 62 90 54 84]
 [55 50 16 42 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we aim to maximize their total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 5 items, we'll distribute them in a way that tries to optimize the total value each agent receives. 

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (66).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (88).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (90).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4 (98), but item 4 is already allocated. The next highest for Agent 3 is item 0 (55).

Now, let's allocate based on the highest available valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (53)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (88)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (90)
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (98)
- Now, item 0 remains unallocated. The highest valuation for item 0 comes from Agent 3 (55).

Let's finalize the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [3]
- **Agent 1**: [1]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: [0, 4]

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
