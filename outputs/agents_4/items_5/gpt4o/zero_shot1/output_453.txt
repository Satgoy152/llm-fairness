Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  33  51  19  81
1  21  37  59  43  97
2   0  95  49  23  64
3  53  14  29  96  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 33 51 19 81]
 [21 37 59 43 97]
 [ 0 95 49 23 64]
 [53 14 29 96 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [3, 33, 51, 19, 81]
Agent 1: [21, 37, 59, 43, 97]
Agent 2: [0, 95, 49, 23, 64]
Agent 3: [53, 14, 29, 96, 35]
```

We can proceed with the allocation by analyzing each agent's preference:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest (81).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (97).
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest (95).
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest (96).

To ensure a fair allocation, let's try to distribute items such that the highest values for each agent are considered while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible:

1. **Agent 1** gets item 4 (highest value for Agent 1 and also highest overall).
2. **Agent 2** gets item 1 (highest value for Agent 2).
3. **Agent 3** gets item 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
4. **Agent 0** gets item 2 (next highest available value for Agent 0).
5. **Agent 0** also gets item 0 (since Agent 0 has room for more items and this is the only one left).

Now, we have the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their preferences as much as possible.
