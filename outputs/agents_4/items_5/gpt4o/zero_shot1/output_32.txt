Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  24  22  43  84
1  53  62  99  91  74
2  43   7  21  61  64
3  56   6  86  95   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [43  7 21 61 64]
 [56  6 86 95  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to try and maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair chance. Since we have 4 agents and 5 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1, Item 2** - Highest value (99) for any item. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 3, Item 3** - Second highest value (95). Assign item 3 to agent 3.
3. **Agent 0, Item 4** - Third highest value (84). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
4. **Agent 1, Item 1** - Next highest value (62). Agent 1 already has an item, so we skip.
5. **Agent 1, Item 3** - Next highest value (91). Agent 1 already has an item, so we skip.
6. **Agent 0, Item 0** - Next highest (67). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
7. **Agent 2, Item 4** - Next highest value (64). Assign item 4 to agent 2.

Now, let's check if we need to re-allocate to ensure each agent gets at least one item:
- Agent 0 has items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 has item 2.
- Agent 2 has no items, and agent 3 has item 3.

We'll make adjustments to ensure each agent gets at least one item:
1. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 1 to balance the allocation.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
