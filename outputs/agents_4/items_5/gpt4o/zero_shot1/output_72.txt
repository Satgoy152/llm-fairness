Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  57  19  54  50
1  84  87  12  23  71
2   6  45  80   0  32
3  86  90  33  35   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 57 19 54 50]
 [84 87 12 23 71]
 [ 6 45 80  0 32]
 [86 90 33 35  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. We will allocate one item per agent initially and then adjust accordingly to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    Items
    0   1   2   3   4
A0  53  57  19  54  50
A1  84  87  12  23  71
A2   6  45  80   0  32
A3  86  90  33  35   1
```

**Greedy Allocation Strategy:**

1. Assign the highest-valued item for each agent, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

2. Adjust assignments to ensure all items are allocated.

Following this approach:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (57).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (87), but since it's already assigned, we assign item 4 (71).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (80).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 (90), but since it's already assigned, we assign item 3 (35).

Now let's allocate the remaining items. Item 1 has already been assigned to Agent 0, so we proceed to assign:

- Item 0 to Agent 1, as it's the next highest valuation for an unassigned item.

This leaves us with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 3

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated, with each agent receiving at least one item, maximizing their total valuation.
