Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  85  97  11  25
1  86  99  83  90  42
2  78  85  76  73  99
3  18   6   1  52  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 85 97 11 25]
 [86 99 83 90 42]
 [78 85 76 73 99]
 [18  6  1 52 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and only 5 items are allocated in total.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Values items as [72, 85, 97, 11, 25]
- **Agent 1**: Values items as [86, 99, 83, 90, 42]
- **Agent 2**: Values items as [78, 85, 76, 73, 99]
- **Agent 3**: Values items as [18, 6, 1, 52, 55]

A potential fair allocation strategy involves assigning items such that each agent gets the highest valued item available that hasn't been allocated yet and tries to maximize overall satisfaction.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (99), so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (97), so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (99), so allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 1** also has high value for item 3 (90), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** has next highest preference for item 0 (72), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 3]
- **Agent 2**: Items [4]
- **Agent 3**: No items

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest preferences, while all 5 items are allocated.
