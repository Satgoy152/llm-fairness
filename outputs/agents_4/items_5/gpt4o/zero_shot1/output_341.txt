Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  77  50  76  35
1   7  52  19  32  83
2  50  99  52   0   4
3  44   8  10  58  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 99 52  0  4]
 [44  8 10 58 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation of items each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated and no agent receives more than one item unless necessary. Here's a possible allocation:

Let's analyze each agent's valuations:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.
- **Agent 1** has high valuation for item 4.
- **Agent 2** has high valuation for item 1.
- **Agent 3** doesn't have particularly high valuations compared to others but could receive an item with lower competition.

Based on this analysis, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (valuation: 77).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (valuation: 99).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (valuation: 76).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (valuation: 83).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (valuation: 10) or to Agent 0 since they value it at 50 and it maximizes overall satisfaction.

Now, let's present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that maximize their satisfaction given the constraints.
