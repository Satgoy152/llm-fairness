Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  73  35  35  72
1  26  56  37  83  94
2  61  75  82  78  44
3  81  94  31  27  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 73 35 35 72]
 [26 56 37 83 94]
 [61 75 82 78 44]
 [81 94 31 27 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  73  35  35  72
1  26  56  37  83  94
2  61  75  82  78  44
3  81  94  31  27  58
```

We will allocate items to agents by considering the highest value each agent places on the available items and ensuring each item is allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Ensure no more than 5 items are allocated in total.

### Item Assignments:
- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is from Agent 0 (97).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation is from Agent 3 (94).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation is from Agent 2 (82).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation is from Agent 1 (83).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation is from Agent 1 (94).

### Final Allocation:
Each agent receives items according to their highest valuations, and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated fairly based on the highest valuations while adhering to the constraints.
