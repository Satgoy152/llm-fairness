Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  62  55  70  83
1  42  75   5  71  17
2  78  13  85  96  17
3  82  31  49  29  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[17 62 55 70 83]
 [42 75  5 71 17]
 [78 13 85 96 17]
 [82 31 49 29 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value received by each agent given their preferences. A potential approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's examine the table again and allocate the items:

```
Agent 0: Values [17, 62, 55, 70, 83]
Agent 1: Values [42, 75, 5, 71, 17]
Agent 2: Values [78, 13, 85, 96, 17]
Agent 3: Values [82, 31, 49, 29, 59]
```

### Allocation Process
1. **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 0 (Value: 83)
2. **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 2 (Value: 85)
3. **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 2 (Value: 96)
4. **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 1 (Value: 75)
5. **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 3 (Value: 82)

This allocation ensures that each agent, except Agent 1, receives the item they value most highly that hasn't already been assigned to another agent, while Agent 1 receives their highest valued available item.

### Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 5 items while ensuring that agents receive items they value highly and that each agent receives at least one item, where possible.
