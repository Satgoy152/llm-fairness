Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  49  16  84  89
1  30  55  94  64  87
2  65  32  48  15  86
3  51  94  80   3  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction (or value) of the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that optimizes overall happiness.

Let's look for an allocation where each agent gets at least one item if possible, and we maximize the total value:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 highly (84) and no other agent values it as highly. So, allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (94), which is higher than any other agent's valuation for this item. So, allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highly (86), and other agents have similar valuations, but agent 2 has no other particularly high valuations. So, allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 highly (94), more than any other agent. So, allocate item 1 to agent 3.
5. Finally, item 0 can be allocated to agent 0, as they have the highest remaining valuation for an unallocated item (46).

Thus, the fair allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.

The total allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
