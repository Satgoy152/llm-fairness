Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  63  30   3   5
1  72  16  58  69  60
2  72  96  73  65  42
3  93   5  11  65  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items, aiming to maximize total satisfaction or fairness. Here, I will consider an allocation strategy that tries to balance the total valuation among agents, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [43, 63, 30, 3, 5]
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 63)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [72, 16, 58, 69, 60]
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (value 72)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [72, 96, 73, 65, 42]
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 96)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [93, 5, 11, 65, 44]
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (value 93)

Given these preferences and the requirement that each agent can receive an integer number of items, it is crucial to ensure that each item is assigned once while balancing the allocations.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Item 2
- **Agent 3**: Items 3 and 4

This allocation tries to give each agent at least one of their highly valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated once, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
