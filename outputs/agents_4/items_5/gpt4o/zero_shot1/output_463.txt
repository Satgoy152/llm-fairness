Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  46  43  38  33
1   7  63   0  38  98
2  93  86   7  62  11
3  65  16  60   7  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 63  0 38 98]
 [93 86  7 62 11]
 [65 16 60  7 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. This is a combinatorial optimization problem, and one approach is to use a greedy algorithm, which looks at the highest value for each item and assigns it to that agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 93. So, assign item 0 to agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 86. So, assign item 1 to agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 60. So, assign item 2 to agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 and agent 1 both value item 3 at 38. However, agent 0 has a higher total value so far. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 98. So, assign item 4 to agent 1.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
