Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  37  51  76  74
1  47  49  77  99  57
2  57   7  26  87  90
3  70  86  44  20  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 37 51 76 74]
 [47 49 77 99 57]
 [57  7 26 87 90]
 [70 86 44 20 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's analyze the given valuations and try to allocate the items accordingly:

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [26, 37, 51, 76, 74]
- Agent 1: [47, 49, 77, 99, 57]
- Agent 2: [57, 7, 26, 87, 90]
- Agent 3: [70, 86, 44, 20, 38]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 3 (99) and item 2 (77). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 4 (90) and item 3 (87). Agent 1 has already taken item 3, so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 3 (76) but it is already taken. Next, item 4 (74) is taken by Agent 2. Allocate item 2 (51) to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 1 (86). Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 1**: Has the next highest value for item 0 (47). Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

### Allocations:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3, 0]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [1]

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the overall valuation each agent receives based on their preferences.
