Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  88  66  52  81
1  74  94  73  75  47
2  53  24  42  22  54
3   8  41   0  45  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 88 66 52 81]
 [74 94 73 75 47]
 [53 24 42 22 54]
 [ 8 41  0 45 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
      0   1   2   3   4
0    60  88  66  52  81
1    74  94  73  75  47
2    53  24  42  22  54
3     8  41   0  45  22
```

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 88). Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 94), but item 1 is already allocated.
   - Next highest valuation is for item 0 (value 74). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 54). Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (value 45). Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining item:

- Item 2 is left unallocated. Since agent 0 has only one item, and item 2 is their second highest valuation (value 66), allocate item 2 to agent 0. 

This ensures that all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
