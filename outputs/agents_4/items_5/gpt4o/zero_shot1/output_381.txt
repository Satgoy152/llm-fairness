Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  79  55  95  41
1  41  37  20  59  57
2  84  43  30  39  34
3  10  10  10  41  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that we have 4 agents and 5 items, one possible approach is to start by allocating items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 3 (95). Assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 4 (57). Assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 0 (84). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Given that the remaining items are 1 and 2, and agent 3 has the same valuation for items 1 and 2 (10), assign item 1 to agent 3, allowing us to re-evaluate the remaining item for optimal distribution.

Re-evaluating the remaining item (item 2) for optimal distribution among the agents:

- **Agent 0** has a valuation of 55 for item 2.
- **Agent 1** has a valuation of 20 for item 2.
- **Agent 2** has a valuation of 30 for item 2.
- **Agent 3** has a valuation of 10 for item 2.

The highest valuation for the remaining item (item 2) is by agent 0 (55), but since agent 0 already has a high-value item, we may allocate item 2 to agent 2 to balance the distribution.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
