Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  59  50  34  31
1  41  35  85  41  53
2  57  33  85  28  26
3  13   8  46  50  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 33 85 28 26]
 [13  8 46 50 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

The given valuation matrix is:
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  59  50  34  31
1  41  35  85  41  53
2  57  33  85  28  26
3  13  8   46  50  65
```

To allocate items:
1. We will look for the highest valuation for each item and assign the item to the respective agent.
2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and in total, only 5 items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:
- Item 0: Agent 2 has the highest value (57).
- Item 1: Agent 0 has the highest value (59).
- Item 2: Agents 1 and 2 both have the highest value (85). We can assign this item to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 3 has the highest value (50).
- Item 4: Agent 3 has the highest value (65).

Now, let's ensure every agent gets a fair share while maintaining the total number of 5 items:

- Agent 0 gets item 1
- Agent 1 gets item 2
- Agent 2 gets item 0
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 4

The allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item where possible.
