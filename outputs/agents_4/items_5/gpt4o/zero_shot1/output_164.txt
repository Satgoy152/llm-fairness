Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  84  36  73  87
1  16  88   0  27  87
2  74  78  53  79  65
3  82  66  11  62  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [82 66 11 62 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider a strategy that gives each agent a fair share of items, taking into account their preferences as depicted in the valuation table. One common approach is to maximize the total overall value while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item when possible.

Here's the valuation table for clarity:

```
   0   1   2   3   4
0  2  84  36  73  87
1 16  88   0  27  87
2 74  78  53  79  65
3 82  66  11  62  72
```

We can approach this problem by assigning items to agents based on the highest value in each row or column and ensuring a fair distribution among agents. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1, so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3, so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 0, so we allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. Now, item 2 is left, and we need to decide based on remaining preferences. Agent 2 has a moderate valuation of item 2, so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.

By this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, and we ensure that each item is assigned.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
