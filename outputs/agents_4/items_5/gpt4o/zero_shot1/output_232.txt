Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  21  83  72  89
1   0  39  77  64  65
2  58  49  17  71  46
3   8  54  55  95  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 2 21 83 72 89]
 [ 0 39 77 64 65]
 [58 49 17 71 46]
 [ 8 54 55 95 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total value of the allocation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This is a typical example of the assignment problem, which can be solved using various methods like the Hungarian algorithm. However, given the simplicity of the problem, we can also manually allocate the items by considering the highest valuations.

Let's analyze the table:

```
Agent 0: [2, 21, 83, 72, 89]
Agent 1: [0, 39, 77, 64, 65]
Agent 2: [58, 49, 17, 71, 46]
Agent 3: [8, 54, 55, 95, 23]
```

To maximize fairness and value:
- Agent 0 should get item 4 (highest value 89).
- Agent 1 should get item 2 (highest remaining value 77).
- Agent 2 should get item 0 (highest remaining value 58).
- Agent 3 should get item 3 (highest remaining value 95).
- The remaining item, item 1, can go to Agent 0, who values it the most among the unallocated items.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 4, 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 3

Final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
