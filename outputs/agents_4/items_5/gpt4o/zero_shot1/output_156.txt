Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  18  59  93  95
1  82   4  44  66  70
2  86  89   8  51   0
3  31  67  18  33  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given the table of valuations, we'll try to allocate the items in such a way that reflects the agents' preferences as much as possible.

Let's go through a possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 86.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 89.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 59.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 93.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 95.

Now, let's check if we can reallocate to give each agent at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Currently has items 2, 3, and 4.
- **Agent 1**: Has no items, but values item 4 second highest after Agent 0.
- **Agent 2**: Currently has items 0 and 1.
- **Agent 3**: No items, but values item 3 second highest after Agent 0.

To ensure that each agent gets at least one item, we can make the following adjustments:

- Give item 4 to Agent 1.
- Give item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent has at least one item:
- Agent 0: Items 2
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: Item 3

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
