Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  17  61  90  97
1  10  53  46  85  33
2  89  95  71  38  33
3  95  89  14  97  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [95 89 14 97 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness. One approach is to use the "maximum sum" method, which tries to allocate items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is maximized.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 (97) and 3 (90).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 3 (85) and 1 (53).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (95) and 0 (89).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 3 (97) and 0 (95).

Based on these valuations, let's try to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Item 3 (90)
- **Agent 1:** Item 1 (53)
- **Agent 2:** Item 0 (89)
- **Agent 3:** Item 4 (44) and Item 2 (14)

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to one agent and attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their highest valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```
