Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  92  56   7  25
1  30  56  34  69  88
2  75  77  61  61  65
3  50  30  66  88  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 92 56  7 25]
 [30 56 34 69 88]
 [75 77 61 61 65]
 [50 30 66 88 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm, which assigns each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Here's the step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 0 (97).
2. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0 (92).
3. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 3 (66).
4. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 3 (88).
5. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 1 (88).

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
