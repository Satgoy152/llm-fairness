Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  99  60  68  54
1  25  43  57  87  31
2  49  80  31  73   5
3  19  41  40  95  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item across all agents**:
   - Item 0: Max value is 49 (Agent 2)
   - Item 1: Max value is 99 (Agent 0)
   - Item 2: Max value is 60 (Agent 0)
   - Item 3: Max value is 95 (Agent 3)
   - Item 4: Max value is 54 (Agent 0)

2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible**:
   - Agent 0 should get item 1 (99) as it is the highest value in the table.
   - Agent 3 should get item 3 (95) as it is the highest value for that item.
   - Agent 2 should get item 0 (49) as it is the highest value for that item.
   - Agent 1 can be given item 2 (57) since it's the highest among remaining items for agent 1.
   - Agent 0 should get the remaining item 4 (54) as no other allocation gives a better total value.

3. **Ensure the allocation is complete and satisfies all conditions**:
   - Each agent receives at least one item.
   - Total items allocated are exactly 5.

Here’s the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item, maximizing their individual valuations.
