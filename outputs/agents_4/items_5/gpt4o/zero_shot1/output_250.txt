Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57   5  34  86  27
1  23  28  94  85  20
2  11  89  85  47  20
3  89  48  99  58  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here, each agent can receive between 0 and 5 items, and we need to allocate exactly 5 items in total.

One common approach is to use a greedy method or optimization strategy to assign items to the agents such that the total valuation is maximized. Let's consider each agent's highest valuation for an item and allocate accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing the valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 86.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 94.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 89.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 99, but it's already taken. Their next highest is item 0 at 89.
5. The remaining items are 4 and 1. Item 1 is already taken, so item 4 is left.

Now, let's distribute these items:

- Allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- Allocate item 0 to agent 3.
- Allocate item 4 to agent 3 (since agent 3 has a high value for item 4, second only to item 2, which is already taken).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest valuations, ensuring a fair distribution of items.
