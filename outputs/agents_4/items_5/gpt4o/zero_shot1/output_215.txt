Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  45  78  74  69
1  76  89  20  39   9
2  29   5  48  97   2
3   7  53  60   2   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize overall happiness or satisfaction. One common approach is to use the "maximum sum allocation" method, which aims to maximize the total value derived from the allocation. The goal is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that every item is allocated and no agent receives more than a fair share.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [18, 45, 78, 74, 69]
Agent 1: [76, 89, 20, 39,  9]
Agent 2: [29,  5, 48, 97,  2]
Agent 3: [ 7, 53, 60,  2,  1]
```

To allocate the items fairly:
1. Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent can have at most the integer number of items allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest value is 76 by Agent 1.
- Item 1: Highest value is 89 by Agent 1.
- Item 2: Highest value is 78 by Agent 0.
- Item 3: Highest value is 97 by Agent 2.
- Item 4: Highest value is 69 by Agent 0.

Now, we check the allocation ensuring each agent has an integer number of items:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.
- Agent 3 receives no items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent is considered according to their highest valuations for specific items.
