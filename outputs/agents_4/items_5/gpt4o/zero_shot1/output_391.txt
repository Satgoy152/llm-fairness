Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  89  39  70  32
1  21  95  12  81  14
2  59  94  49  13  48
3  35  90   4  68  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 95 12 81 14]
 [59 94 49 13 48]
 [35 90  4 68 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. With only 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's evaluate the valuations and try to allocate based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction:

**Valuations Table:**

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  89  39  70  32
1  21  95  12  81  14
2  59  94  49  13  48
3  35  90   4  68  56
```

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Agent 1:** The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 1 (95). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 0:** The next highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 3 (70). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 2:** The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 0 (59). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 4 (56). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

5. Now, only item 2 is left. Assign this item to an agent with the highest leftover valuation.

   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 39.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 12.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 at 49.
   - Agent 3 values item 2 at 4.

   Therefore, assign item 2 to Agent 2, who has the highest leftover valuation for item 2.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
