Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  90  45  41  50
1  70  17  76  17  56
2  64   2  77   1  98
3  59  51  41  24  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can aim to maximize the total valuations for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0 and 1. Allocating these two items to Agent 0 maximizes their valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 2 among all agents. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Left with item 3, which has relatively low valuations across the board, but is best assigned to Agent 3 to ensure every agent gets at least one item or the best possible allocation given the constraints.

Following this strategy, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
