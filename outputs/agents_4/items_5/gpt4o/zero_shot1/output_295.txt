Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  86  39  72  68
1   0  27  30   3  12
2  46  76  88  32  72
3  12  66  60  72  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 76 88 32 72]
 [12 66 60 72 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We can consider each agent's preferences based on the values they assign to the items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 (value = 86).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 (value = 30).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 2 (value = 88). Since item 2 is already allocated, we look at the next highest value, which is item 1 (value = 76), but it is also allocated. So, we choose item 0 (value = 46).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 3 (value = 72).

Now, only item 4 is left unallocated, and the agent with the highest remaining preference for item 4 is Agent 2 (value = 72).

Here is the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing the total value based on their preferences.
