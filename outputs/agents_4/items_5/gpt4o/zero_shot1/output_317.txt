Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  32   8   3   9
1  14  99  45  26  30
2  18  47  67   8   0
3  96  13  74  95  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[47 32  8  3  9]
 [14 99 45 26 30]
 [18 47 67  8  0]
 [96 13 74 95 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each item is only given to one agent. Let's analyze the valuations and try to assign items in a way that maximizes fairness and total value.

Here are the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  32   8   3   9
1  14  99  45  26  30
2  18  47  67   8   0
3  96  13  74  95  81
```

We can approach this problem by considering the highest valuations for each item and assigning them accordingly, ensuring that no agent is over-allocated:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 96.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 with 99.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 74.

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 95.

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 81.

Agent 3 has the highest valuations for many items, but we need to distribute items fairly among all agents. Let's try to optimize the allocation to balance the distribution:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest after Agent 3).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (to ensure Agent 0 receives an item).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the items are allocated based on maximizing individual agent valuations as much as possible.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
