Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  23  49  27  76
1  45  77  77  18  74
2  61  42   1  93   8
3  26  67  66  76  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[64 23 49 27 76]
 [45 77 77 18 74]
 [61 42  1 93  8]
 [26 67 66 76 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One approach is to use a method similar to the "Hungarian algorithm" for assignment problems, which finds an optimal assignment that minimizes the total cost or maximizes the total valuation.

Here are the given valuations for reference:

- Agent 0: [64, 23, 49, 27, 76]
- Agent 1: [45, 77, 77, 18, 74]
- Agent 2: [61, 42, 1, 93, 8]
- Agent 3: [26, 67, 66, 76, 95]

We will assign items to agents based on the highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and a total of 5 items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation 93).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest valuation 95).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation 77).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation 77).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation 64).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total valuation is maximized based on the given table.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
