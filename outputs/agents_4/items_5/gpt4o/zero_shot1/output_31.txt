Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  42  68  21  33
1  98  50   6   7  59
2  37  81  41  14  93
3  10  89  16   7  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. The valuations provided are:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 63     | 42     | 68     | 21     | 33     |
| 1     | 98     | 50     | 6      | 7      | 59     |
| 2     | 37     | 81     | 41     | 14     | 93     |
| 3     | 10     | 89     | 16     | 7      | 36     |

Let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences:

1. **Agent 1 (highest valuation on item 0):** Item 0 (98)
2. **Agent 2 (highest valuation on item 4):** Item 4 (93)
3. **Agent 3 (highest valuation on item 1):** Item 1 (89)
4. **Agent 0 (highest valuation on item 2):** Item 2 (68)

At this point, all items except item 3 have been allocated, and each agent has at least one item. We still need to allocate item 3:

5. **Agent 0 (next highest valuation):** Item 3 (21)

This allocation distributes all items among the agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
