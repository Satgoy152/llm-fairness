Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  83  38  12  39
1  65  39  22  73  89
2  68  99  34  24  26
3  69  51  12  37  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 39 22 73 89]
 [68 99 34 24 26]
 [69 51 12 37 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize total satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, where possible. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations for each item, ensuring each agent gets one item first if possible.
2. After each agent has at least one item, assign remaining items to the agent who values them the most.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Item 0: The highest valuation is 74 by Agent 0.
- Item 1: The highest valuation is 99 by Agent 2.
- Item 2: The highest valuation is 38 by Agent 0 (Agent 0 already has one item, but let's consider others). Agent 0 already has item 0, so the next highest is 34 by Agent 2 (Agent 2 already has one item, but let's consider others). The next highest is 22 by Agent 1.
- Item 3: The highest valuation is 73 by Agent 1.
- Item 4: The highest valuation is 89 by Agent 1 (Agent 1 already has one item, but let's consider others). The next highest is 76 by Agent 3.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 4

So, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
