Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  64  44  92  94
1  70   7  67  99  93
2  40  55  12  55  26
3  81  45  23  30  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 64 44 92 94]
 [70  7 67 99 93]
 [40 55 12 55 26]
 [81 45 23 30 98]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. 

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [97, 64, 44, 92, 94]
- Agent 1: [70, 7, 67, 99, 93]
- Agent 2: [40, 55, 12, 55, 26]
- Agent 3: [81, 45, 23, 30, 98]

Given that there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each.

We'll try to allocate the items to maximize the total individual valuations.

1. Start by allocating the highest value item for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (value 97)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (value 99)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (value 55)
   - Agent 3: Item 4 (value 98)

This allocation uses 4 items, leaving 1 item unallocated (Item 2).

2. Allocate the remaining item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 (value 67).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Items 3 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets Item 1.
- Agent 3 gets Item 4.

The fair allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
