Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  82  14  70  13
1  14  73  31  39  76
2  96  18  35  69  37
3  32  90  20  19  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [32 90 20 19 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that balances the total value received by each agent. One common approach is to use a strategy that maximizes the total value while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's consider a balanced allocation based on the given valuations:

Valuations Table:
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  82  14  70  13
1  14  73  31  39  76
2  96  18  35  69  37
3  32  90  20  19  41
```

We can proceed by selecting the highest valued items for each agent iteratively, ensuring a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is 82 for item 1.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is 76 for item 4.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is 96 for item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is 90 for item 1, but item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is 41 for item 4, but item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1. Next, 32 for item 0, but item 0 is already allocated to Agent 2. Thus, we give item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, considering the remaining unallocated items, we allocate them to maximize fairness:

5. **Agent 0**: Already has item 1, but the next best remaining allocation would be item 2 (14).
6. **Agent 1**: Already has item 4.
7. **Agent 2**: Already has item 0.
8. **Agent 3**: Already has item 3.

After this analysis, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total value distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.
