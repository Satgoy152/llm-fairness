Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  69  47  87  54
1  39   2  45   6  57
2  64  84  33  48  70
3   8  94   2  14  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39  2 45  6 57]
 [64 84 33 48 70]
 [ 8 94  2 14 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and ideally, the total value each agent perceives from their allocation is maximized.

Letâ€™s examine the valuations for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: 14, 69, 47, 87, 54
- Agent 1's valuations: 39, 2, 45, 6, 57
- Agent 2's valuations: 64, 84, 33, 48, 70
- Agent 3's valuations: 8, 94, 2, 14, 18

A potential allocation can be made by considering the highest valuations for each item and ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (64)
2. Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (94)
3. Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (45)
4. Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (87)
5. Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (70)

Considering these valuations and aiming to distribute items fairly:

- Agent 0 receives item 3
- Agent 1 receives item 2
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4
- Agent 3 receives item 1

This allocation ensures each agent receives an item (except Agent 3 who gets one item), and the number of items allocated is exactly 5.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
