Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  98   8  17  78
1  13  71  14  51  43
2  61  51  82  19  71
3  51  21  88  10  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 71 14 51 43]
 [61 51 82 19 71]
 [51 21 88 10 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. We can aim to allocate items such that the sum of the values for each agent is as balanced as possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuation table and make allocations that maximize the total value for each agent:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  98   8  17  78
1  13  71  14  51  43
2  61  51  82  19  71
3  51  21  88  10  82
```

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0 because agent 0 values item 0 very highly (98), which is the highest valuation for any item among all agents.
- Assign item 2 to agent 3 because agent 3 values item 2 the most (88).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 because agent 1 values item 1 the most (71).
- Assign item 4 to agent 2 because agent 2 values item 4 the most (71).
- Assign item 3 to agent 1 because agent 1 values item 3 second highest (51).

This way, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocations are fairly distributed based on the highest valuations. The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
