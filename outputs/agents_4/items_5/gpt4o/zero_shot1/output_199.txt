Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  30  68  98  67
1  88  79  93  17  99
2  46  56  57  98  35
3  71  37  29  21  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[80 30 68 98 67]
 [88 79 93 17 99]
 [46 56 57 98 35]
 [71 37 29 21 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation that each agent gets from their allocated items. Here is one way to allocate these items:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 98.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest at 99.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it at 88, which is higher than any other agent's valuation for item 0.
4. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it at 93, which is higher than any other agent's valuation for item 2.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest at 56.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": []
}
```
