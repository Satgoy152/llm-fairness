Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  53  73  68  51
1  71  78  92  75  96
2  70  20  81  15  94
3   2  83  36  28  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 53 73 68 51]
 [71 78 92 75 96]
 [70 20 81 15 94]
 [ 2 83 36 28 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents, we'll aim to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and maximize their respective valuations. Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [95, 53, 73, 68, 51]
Agent 1: [71, 78, 92, 75, 96]
Agent 2: [70, 20, 81, 15, 94]
Agent 3: [2, 83, 36, 28, 14]
```

First, identify the highest valuations for each item across all agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (95)
- Item 1: Agent 3 (83)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (92)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (75)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (96)

To achieve a fair allocation, let's assign items based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible:

1. Agent 0 gets item 0 (highest valuation for item 0).
2. Agent 3 gets item 1 (highest valuation for item 1).
3. Agent 1 gets item 4 (highest remaining valuation for item 4).
4. Agent 2 gets item 2 (highest remaining valuation for item 2).

Now we have 1 item left to allocate, and only Agent 1 hasn't received an item yet:

5. Agent 1 gets item 3 (highest remaining valuation for item 3).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation maximizes the total valuation based on the given preferences.
