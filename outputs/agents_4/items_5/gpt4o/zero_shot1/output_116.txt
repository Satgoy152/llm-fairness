Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  97  97  88  98
1  54  29   9   7  67
2  60  99  39  46   1
3  64  28  65  42  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [64 28 65 42 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction or to ensure each agent receives at least one high-value item relative to their preferences. We'll aim for a balanced allocation based on the table provided:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  97  97  88  98
1  54  29   9   7  67
2  60  99  39  46   1
3  64  28  65  42  55
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, if possible.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Try to distribute high-value items fairly among the agents.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it at 64, which is the highest.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 99, which is the highest.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 97 (tied with item 1, but item 1 is already assigned to Agent 2).
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 88, which is the highest.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 98, which is the highest.

Now let's ensure each agent has at least one item:
- Agent 0 currently has items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 has no items yet, but we can reallocate item 0 from agent 3 to agent 1 because agent 3's highest value is less than the value agent 1 has for item 4.
- Agent 2 has item 1.
- Agent 3 currently has no items, so let's move item 2 from agent 0 to agent 3.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
