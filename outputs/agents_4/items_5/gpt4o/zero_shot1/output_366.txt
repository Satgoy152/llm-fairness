Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5   0  60  54  72
1   4  41  32  11  40
2  55  97  18   6  27
3  36  62  78  50  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 62 78 50 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value for each agent or distributing items to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent can receive some value and no item is over-allocated.

Here's the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 55.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 97.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 78.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 54.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 72.

Assigning items based on the highest valuation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: Item 2

Presenting this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
