Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  81  43  38  23
1  22  14  91  74  98
2  64  64   0  11  25
3  89  54  96  88  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure each agent receives items such that the total value is maximized for each agent given their preferences. One common approach to solving this problem is by using the "Hungarian Algorithm," which is used to find the optimal assignment for maximum benefit in a weighted bipartite graph.

Let's consider the valuations and allocate items such that agents get the items with maximum valuations, ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 highly (88), and it has the highest value for item 0 among all agents.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 highly (98), and it has the highest value for item 4 among all agents.
3. **Agent 2** doesn't have very high preferences compared to others, so we'll assign item 1 (64) to them as they have a high valuation for it, ensuring others get their priority.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 highly (96), and it has the highest value for item 2 among all agents.
5. **Lastly**, Agent 1 can be assigned item 3 (74) as it is the next highest value they have.

Following this approach, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2

Now, let's format this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
