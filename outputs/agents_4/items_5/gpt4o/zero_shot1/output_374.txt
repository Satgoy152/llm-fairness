Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  25  45  20  49
1  40  41  55  61  82
2  91  61  48  65  91
3  32  67  31  19  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 67 31 19 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll consider assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item.

Let's begin by listing the items to be allocated and consider maximizing the overall satisfaction:

Valuations:
- Agent 0: [77, 25, 45, 20, 49]
- Agent 1: [40, 41, 55, 61, 82]
- Agent 2: [91, 61, 48, 65, 91]
- Agent 3: [32, 67, 31, 19, 55]

To allocate items, we will try to maximize the sum of valuations by assigning items based on the highest valuations first:

1. **Item 0** - Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 91.
2. **Item 4** - Agent 2 also values this at 91, so assign it to Agent 2.
3. **Item 3** - Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 61.
4. **Item 1** - Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 67.
5. **Item 2** - Agent 1 has the next highest valuation of 55.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: No items are allocated.
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 4.
- Agent 3: Item 1.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
