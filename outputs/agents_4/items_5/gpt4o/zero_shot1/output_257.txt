Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  68  81   4  71
1  17  69  48  26  75
2   2  73  91  30  65
3  60  67   4  92  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 73 91 30 65]
 [60 67  4 92 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a method that seeks to optimize the total satisfaction for each agent. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and allocate that item to the respective agent.

2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, while respecting the total number of items.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  68  81   4  71
1  17  69  48  26  75
2   2  73  91  30  65
3  60  67   4  92  61
```

Now, let's identify the highest valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 3 with a value of 60
- Item 1: Agent 2 with a value of 73
- Item 2: Agent 2 with a value of 91
- Item 3: Agent 3 with a value of 92
- Item 4: Agent 1 with a value of 75

Using this information, we'll attempt to allocate the items such that each agent has at least one item:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 3.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

Agent 0 does not receive any items since they have the lowest valuations across the board.

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to the agent who values it most, while still allowing each agent (except Agent 0) to receive at least one item.
