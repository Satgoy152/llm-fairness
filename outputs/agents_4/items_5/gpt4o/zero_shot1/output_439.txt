Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  32  39  79  67
1  66   2  80  55  71
2   4   3  81  89  26
3  73  47  71  87  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[23 32 39 79 67]
 [66  2 80 55 71]
 [ 4  3 81 89 26]
 [73 47 71 87 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible). Given there are 5 items and 4 agents, one of the agents can receive two items, or one agent can receive no item if it's necessary to maximize fairness or value.

Let's analyze the values and make allocations:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: [23, 32, 39, 79, 67]
- **Agent 1**: [66, 2, 80, 55, 71]
- **Agent 2**: [4, 3, 81, 89, 26]
- **Agent 3**: [73, 47, 71, 87, 39]

### Highest Valuations per Item:
- **Item 0**: Agent 1 (66)
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 (32)
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 (81)
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 (89)
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 (71)

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value 89).
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest value 81).
3. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value 71).
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value 66).
5. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value 32).

### Allocation Result:
- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets Items 2 and 3.
- Agent 3 gets no items.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that the distribution of items is as fair as possible given the constraints.
