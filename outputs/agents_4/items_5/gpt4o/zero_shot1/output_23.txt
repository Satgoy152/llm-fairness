Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  35  49  88  28
1  38  39   4  40  41
2  57  49  58  98  77
3  30  43  13  80  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use the "maximum sum" or "maximum weight matching" method in a bipartite graph. However, for simplicity and given the small size of this example, we can manually allocate while aiming for a fair distribution based on the highest valuations for each item.

Let's look at the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [51, 35, 49, 88, 28]
Agent 1: [38, 39, 4, 40, 41]
Agent 2: [57, 49, 58, 98, 77]
Agent 3: [30, 43, 13, 80, 29]
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (57). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (43). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (58). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (98). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (77). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

### Resulting Allocation:

Based on this strategy, Agent 2 has the highest total valuation, so most items are assigned to Agent 2. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

Agent 0 and Agent 1 receive no items, Agent 2 receives four items, and Agent 3 receives one item. This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed.
