Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  96  50  52  15
1  27  51  62  63   8
2  63  45  58  35   0
3  19  84  65  12  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a "round-robin" or "maximal satisfaction" allocation strategy. Here, we aim to assign items by considering each agent's highest-valued items first, while ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 1 (96)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 3 (63)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (63)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value: Item 1 (84), but already taken by agent 0, so next highest is Item 4 (68)

Now, let's allocate the remaining item:

5. **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest value: Item 3, but taken by agent 1. Next highest available is Item 2 (50)

Now each agent has been allocated at least one item, and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
