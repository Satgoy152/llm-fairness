Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  69   4  36   0
1  42  50  15  85  25
2  69  32  52  72  51
3  58  45  94  38  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 50 15 85 25]
 [69 32 52 72 51]
 [58 45 94 38 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives one item, as there are four agents and five items. We will choose items based on maximizing the value each agent receives while ensuring a fair distribution of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [63, 69, 4, 36, 0]
- Agent 1: [42, 50, 15, 85, 25]
- Agent 2: [69, 32, 52, 72, 51]
- Agent 3: [58, 45, 94, 38, 91]

We need to assign one item to each agent, but since there are five items, one agent will receive two items. We'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 (69) the highest. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 (85) the highest. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 (69) the highest. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 (94) the highest. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Each agent has been assigned one item, and we have one item left to allocate, which is item 4.

5. Item 4 (91) is valued highest by Agent 3. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.
