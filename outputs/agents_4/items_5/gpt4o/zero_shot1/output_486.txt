Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  17  41  95   6
1  96  42  73  13  41
2  89  94  74  47  83
3  49  80  47  60  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We will attempt to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (sum of values) is maximized.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** First, identify the highest valuation each agent has for the available items. This will help ensure that each agent is satisfied with at least one of their top preferences.

2. **Allocate Items:** Distribute items based on the highest valuations to ensure a fair distribution. We will try to give each agent at least one of their top preferences.

3. **Adjust Allocations:** If any items remain unallocated or if adjustments are necessary to ensure fairness, make those adjustments.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest (95). We allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (96). We allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest (94). We allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 the second highest (80), but since item 1 is allocated to agent 2, we look for the next highest available valued item for agent 3 which is item 4 (51). We allocate item 4 to agent 3.
- The remaining unallocated item is item 2. We check the remaining agents who do not have this item. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2 (74), so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed to maximize the agentsâ€™ individual valuations.
