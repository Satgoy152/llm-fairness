Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  10  49  37  24
1  42  93  44   5  38
2  79   2  10  63   9
3  96  57  69  47   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. Look at the highest valuations for each item and assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 5 items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0: 41
  - Agent 1: 42
  - Agent 2: 79
  - Agent 3: 96
  - Highest valuation: Agent 3

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 10
  - Agent 1: 93
  - Agent 2: 2
  - Agent 3: 57
  - Highest valuation: Agent 1

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 49
  - Agent 1: 44
  - Agent 2: 10
  - Agent 3: 69
  - Highest valuation: Agent 3

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 37
  - Agent 1: 5
  - Agent 2: 63
  - Agent 3: 47
  - Highest valuation: Agent 2

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0: 24
  - Agent 1: 38
  - Agent 2: 9
  - Agent 3: 7
  - Highest valuation: Agent 1

Assigning each item to the agent with the highest valuation, we have:

- Item 0 goes to Agent 3
- Item 1 goes to Agent 1
- Item 2 goes to Agent 3
- Item 3 goes to Agent 2
- Item 4 goes to Agent 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated.
