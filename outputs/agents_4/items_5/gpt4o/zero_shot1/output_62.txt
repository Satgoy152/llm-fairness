Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  17  78  24  20
1   8  91  37  26  62
2  98  66  74  91  23
3  21  32  46  14  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 91 37 26 62]
 [98 66 74 91 23]
 [21 32 46 14 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation from the items they receive. One approach is to allocate items by considering each agent's highest valuations.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 with a value of 78.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 with a value of 91.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 with a value of 98.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 with a value of 64.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 3.

5. **Unallocated item (3)**:
   - Consider the remaining item 3 for allocation.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 91.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their valuation based on the available data.
