Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  26   9  94  35
1  90  85  82  95  39
2  24  87   3   9  60
3  18   1  13   3   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56 26  9 94 35]
 [90 85 82 95 39]
 [24 87  3  9 60]
 [18  1 13  3  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation by assigning items to agents who value them the most. We will assign each item to the agent who has the highest valuation for that item. Let's look at each item and assign it accordingly:

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 56
   - Agent 1 values it at 90 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 24
   - Agent 3 values it at 18
   - Assign to Agent 1

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 26
   - Agent 1 values it at 85 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 87 (highest)
   - Agent 3 values it at 1
   - Assign to Agent 2 (in case of a tie, we can choose either agent; here, I am selecting Agent 2)

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 82 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 3
   - Agent 3 values it at 13
   - Assign to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 94 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 95 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 9
   - Agent 3 values it at 3
   - Assign to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 35
   - Agent 1 values it at 39 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 60 (highest)
   - Agent 3 values it at 1
   - Assign to Agent 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while each agent receives an integer number of items.
