Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  81  28  78  42
1   8  14  68   1  93
2  36  52  83  29   2
3  77  64  66  53  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 81 28 78 42]
 [ 8 14 68  1 93]
 [36 52 83 29  2]
 [77 64 66 53 77]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while maximizing the total value each agent receives, we can use a strategy that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation could work based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 11
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 36
   - Agent 3 values it at 77
   - **Allocation**: Assign to Agent 3 (highest value)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 81
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 52
   - Agent 3 values it at 64
   - **Allocation**: Assign to Agent 0 (highest value)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 28
   - Agent 1 values it at 68
   - Agent 2 values it at 83
   - Agent 3 values it at 66
   - **Allocation**: Assign to Agent 2 (highest value)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 78
   - Agent 1 values it at 1
   - Agent 2 values it at 29
   - Agent 3 values it at 53
   - **Allocation**: Assign to Agent 0 (highest value)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 42
   - Agent 1 values it at 93
   - Agent 2 values it at 2
   - Agent 3 values it at 77
   - **Allocation**: Assign to Agent 1 (highest value)

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives item 0.

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.
