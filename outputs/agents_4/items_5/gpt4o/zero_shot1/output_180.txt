Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  52  28   4  78
1  21  63  42  82  89
2  62  78  67  28  74
3  31  84   3  14  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[40 52 28  4 78]
 [21 63 42 82 89]
 [62 78 67 28 74]
 [31 84  3 14 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. This is akin to solving an optimization problem where each agent tries to obtain the items they value the most. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most (78).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most (82).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the most (78).
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (31).

This allocation covers four items, leaving one more item to be allocated. At this point, we should consider the next highest unallocated item that maximizes the benefit across agents:

5. The remaining item is item 2. Agent 2 values item 2 at 67, which is higher than any other agent's unallocated item values.

Thus, the fair allocation of items considering maximum individual valuations for each agent is:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [1, 2]
- Agent 3: [0]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
