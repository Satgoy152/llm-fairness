Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  20  69  10  20
1  56  41  38  86  15
2  67  92  99  29  95
3  93  85  52  29  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 20 69 10 20]
 [56 41 38 86 15]
 [67 92 99 29 95]
 [93 85 52 29 34]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents based on their valuations, we will use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Since there are 4 agents and 5 items, one agent will end up with two items.

Here are the valuations for each agent and item:

```
Agent 0: [95, 20, 69, 10, 20]
Agent 1: [56, 41, 38, 86, 15]
Agent 2: [67, 92, 99, 29, 95]
Agent 3: [93, 85, 52, 29, 34]
```

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2 (99). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (95). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 3 (29, but considering remaining items, let's prioritize based on the next highest). Assign item 1 to Agent 3 since they have a high valuation for item 1 (85).
4. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 (86). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
5. The remaining item is 4. Between the remaining agents who haven't reached their item capacity, Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for item 4 (95). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total allocation utilizes the highest possible valuations for the given constraints.
