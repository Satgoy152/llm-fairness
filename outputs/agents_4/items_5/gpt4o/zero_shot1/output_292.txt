Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  15  13  65  83
1   4  83  30  60  62
2  20  20  71  50  33
3  84  62  11  91  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

One possible approach is to allocate the items based on the highest values for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each agent receives a fair share. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest value preference for each agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest value is for item 4 (83).
   - Agent 1's highest value is for item 1 (83).
   - Agent 2's highest value is for item 2 (71).
   - Agent 3's highest value is for item 3 (91).

2. **Allocate the items based on highest preference while ensuring no overlap:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

3. **Allocate the remaining item:**
   - The remaining item is item 0. The highest available valuation for this item is by Agent 3 (84).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3, 0]

The total number of items allocated is 5, which is correct. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```
