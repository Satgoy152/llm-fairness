Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  50  85  73  86
1  45  62  61  64  94
2  41  97  44  94  57
3  86  12  22  90  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes the overall satisfaction of agents. A common method is to use a variant of the assignment problem, which can be solved using algorithms like the Hungarian algorithm. However, given the small size of this problem, we can also use a heuristic method to ensure a fair allocation.

Let's consider a potential allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations to each agent, ensuring fairness by distributing the total number of items equally among the agents.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (86), so assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest as well, but it's already assigned, so assign item 1 to agent 1 (value of 62).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (97), so assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (86), so assign item 0 to agent 3.

Now, let's check the remaining items and allocations:
- Items 2 and 3 are unallocated.
- Agent 0 has 1 item; agent 1 has 1 item; agent 2 has 1 item; agent 3 has 1 item.

To allocate the remaining items fairly, we can consider:
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value of 85).
- Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value of 90).

Now, the allocation is balanced, and every agent has an integer number of items, with a total of 5 items allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while considering the agents' valuations.
