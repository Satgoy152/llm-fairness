Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  54  35  15  65
1  15  21  88  13  42
2  45  83   1  21  59
3  53  31  86  26  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation of the allocation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are item 0 (70) and item 4 (65).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2 (88).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 1 (83).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 3 is item 2 (86), but it's already taken by Agent 1. The next best item is item 0 (53), but it's already taken by Agent 0. The next best available item is item 3 (26).

Considering the above preferences and ensuring all items are allocated:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 3

Here's the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated based on their highest valuation.
