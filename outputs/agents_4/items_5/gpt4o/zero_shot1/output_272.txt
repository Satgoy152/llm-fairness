Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  71  15  40  25
1  57  79  79  58  11
2  28  43  43  20  23
3  53  61  64  95  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[64 71 15 40 25]
 [57 79 79 58 11]
 [28 43 43 20 23]
 [53 61 64 95 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We will ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's a strategy to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 71.
2. Agent 1: Agent 1 values items 2 and 1 equally at 79, but item 1 is already allocated, so we assign item 2.
3. Agent 2: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 43, but it is already allocated, so we consider the next highest valuation, which is item 0 at 28.
4. Agent 3: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 3 with a value of 95.

Remaining item:
- Item 4: The highest remaining valuation is by Agent 3 at 85.

Final allocation based on maximizing individual valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: No item left for optimal value, but we must allocate. Allocate item 4.
- Agent 3: Items 1 and 3

Now, letâ€™s write this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
