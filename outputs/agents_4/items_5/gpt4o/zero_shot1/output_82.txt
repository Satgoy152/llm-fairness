Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  54   1  73  73
1  55  73  92   1  49
2  90  15  25  72  42
3  21  52  93  12  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. One effective method is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest value for each agent sequentially.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 54
  - Item 2: 1
  - Item 3: 73
  - Item 4: 73

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 92
  - Item 3: 1
  - Item 4: 49

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 15
  - Item 2: 25
  - Item 3: 72
  - Item 4: 42

- Agent 3:
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 52
  - Item 2: 93
  - Item 3: 12
  - Item 4: 62

To allocate the items:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 3 because it has the highest value (93) for Agent 3.
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 because it has the highest value (90) for Agent 2.
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value (73) for Agent 1.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value (73) for Agent 0.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 because it has the highest remaining value (62) for Agent 3.

Now, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 4

Ensure that each agent has at least one item, and items are distributed fairly based on their valuations. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
