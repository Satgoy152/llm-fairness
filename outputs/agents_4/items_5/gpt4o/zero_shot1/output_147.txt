Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  46  38  49  62
1  61  91  89  31   2
2  51  76  57  63  98
3  54  36  11   3  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. Evaluate the highest valuations for each item and assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 90
   - Agent 1 values it at 61
   - Agent 2 values it at 51
   - Agent 3 values it at 54
   - Highest value: Agent 0 with 90

3. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 46
   - Agent 1 values it at 91
   - Agent 2 values it at 76
   - Agent 3 values it at 36
   - Highest value: Agent 1 with 91

4. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38
   - Agent 1 values it at 89
   - Agent 2 values it at 57
   - Agent 3 values it at 11
   - Highest value: Agent 1 with 89

5. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 31
   - Agent 2 values it at 63
   - Agent 3 values it at 3
   - Highest value: Agent 2 with 63

6. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 62
   - Agent 1 values it at 2
   - Agent 2 values it at 98
   - Agent 3 values it at 31
   - Highest value: Agent 2 with 98

Now, based on this analysis, we can allocate the items to the agents:

- Agent 0 gets item 0
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 4
- Agent 3 gets no items

Let's present the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": []
}
```
