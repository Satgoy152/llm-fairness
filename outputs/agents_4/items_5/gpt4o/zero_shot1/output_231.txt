Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  82  60  39  14
1   8   9  43  16  81
2  44  32  45  40  31
3  67   6  67  51  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 82 60 39 14]
 [ 8  9 43 16 81]
 [44 32 45 40 31]
 [67  6 67 51 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. 

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 60
  - Item 3: 39
  - Item 4: 14

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 9
  - Item 2: 43
  - Item 3: 16
  - Item 4: 81

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 44
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 45
  - Item 3: 40
  - Item 4: 31

- Agent 3 values:
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 67
  - Item 3: 51
  - Item 4: 20

A potential fair allocation could be determined by allocating items to the agents who value them the most:

1. For Item 0, both Agents 0 and 3 value it equally at 67. We can assign it to Agent 0.
2. For Item 1, Agent 0 values it the most at 82.
3. For Item 2, both Agents 0 and 3 value it equally at 67. We can assign it to Agent 3.
4. For Item 3, Agent 3 values it the most at 51.
5. For Item 4, Agent 1 values it the most at 81.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and the total value is maximized for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
