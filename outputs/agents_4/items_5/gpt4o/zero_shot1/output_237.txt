Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  36  92  94  22
1  71  90  29  46  68
2  95  97  29  55  89
3  14  12  46  72  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction or valuation of the agents for the items they receive. One common approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation an agent has for an item, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the items are distributed fairly.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of one possible allocation:

1. Consider each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that all agents get at least one item, if possible.

2. For item 0, the highest valuation is 95 by agent 2. Assign item 0 to agent 2.
3. For item 1, the highest valuation is 97 by agent 2. Since agent 2 already has an item, consider the next highest, which is 90 by agent 1. Assign item 1 to agent 1.
4. For item 2, the highest valuation is 92 by agent 0. Assign item 2 to agent 0.
5. For item 3, the highest valuation is 94 by agent 0. Since agent 0 already has an item, consider the next highest, which is 72 by agent 3. Assign item 3 to agent 3.
6. For item 4, the highest valuation is 89 by agent 2. Since agent 2 already has an item, the next highest is 80 by agent 3. Since agent 3 already has an item, consider agent 1 with a valuation of 68. Assign item 4 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair allocation based on their valuation, and each item is allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
