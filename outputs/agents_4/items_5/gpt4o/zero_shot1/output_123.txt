Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  26  52  33  45
1  89  66  82  25  58
2  76  99  49  62  21
3  62  92  85   1  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [62 92 85  1 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a methodology like maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will end up with two items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent initially. This might mean giving an agent a less preferred item if it means another agent can also get a high-value item.

2. Assign the remaining item to the agent who would benefit the most in terms of increasing the overall valuation.

Following this approach:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 85.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 89, but since item 0 is already taken, we assign item 2 (82) instead.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 99.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 92, but since item 1 is taken, we assign item 4 (66) instead.

Now, one item remains unassigned. We choose item 3 and allocate it to the agent who benefits the most. Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 3, which is 33.

Thus, the allocation can be done as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
