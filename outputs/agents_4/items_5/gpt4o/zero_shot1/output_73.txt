Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  77  59   4  51
1  47  36  61  36  50
2  44  48  18  76  86
3  10  86  37   9  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 86 37  9 17]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation item is 1 (77).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation item is 2 (61).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation item is 4 (86).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation item is 1 (86), but item 1 is already allocated. The next highest is item 0 (10), but it's less valuable. Another option is to choose the highest available from other agents' less valued items.

Given the constraints and to maximize the total valuation, a reasonable allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (77)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (61)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (86)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (10), Item 3 (9)

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, maximizes the valuation for each agent according to the available options, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
