Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  31  58  39  25
1  46   9  26  94  22
2  79  14  64  77  68
3  46  63  89  63  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach is to assign items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no agent receives more than one item until all others have received at least one. Here's one way to allocate the items based on their valuations:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign it to the respective agent:**

    - Item 0: Highest valuation is 79 by Agent 2.
    - Item 1: Highest valuation is 63 by Agent 3.
    - Item 2: Highest valuation is 89 by Agent 3.
    - Item 3: Highest valuation is 94 by Agent 1.
    - Item 4: Highest valuation is 68 by Agent 2.

2. **Allocate these items to the agents:**

   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.
   - Agent 3 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives item 3.
   - Agent 0 receives no items, as all are allocated based on higher valuations by other agents.

Now, we can present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation method ensures that items are allocated based on the highest valuations, which maximizes overall satisfaction.
