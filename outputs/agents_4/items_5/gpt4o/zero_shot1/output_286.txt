Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  65  94  90  82
1   6  65  83  30  76
2  32  70  90  62  75
3  12  94  35   3  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 94 35  3 49]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the situation to find an optimal allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - High valuations: Item 2 (94), Item 3 (90)
   
2. Agent 1:
   - High valuations: Item 2 (83), Item 4 (76)

3. Agent 2:
   - High valuations: Item 2 (90), Item 1 (70)

4. Agent 3:
   - High valuations: Item 1 (94)

An effective strategy is often to allocate the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most. We need to ensure that all 5 items are allocated.

Let's consider the following allocations based on each agent's highest preferences:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 94, which is the highest for Item 2).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 90, which is the highest for Item 3).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3 (value 94, which is the highest for Item 1).
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (value 76, highest among available preferences for Item 4).
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (value 32, given the remaining options).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value while distributing all items fairly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```
