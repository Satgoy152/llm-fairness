Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  71  65  30  62
1  80   8  85  60  50
2  24  20  12   2  43
3  36  49  46  84  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should look for a way to maximize the total value derived by all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One common approach is to use a method similar to the Hungarian algorithm to find an optimal assignment.

Given the agents' valuations, let's attempt to allocate items:

1. **Agent 1** has a high valuation of item 2 (85), so let's allocate item 2 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 3** has a high valuation of item 3 (84), so let's allocate item 3 to agent 3.
3. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 0 (48) and 1 (71). Let's allocate item 1 to agent 0.
4. **Agent 2** has the highest remaining valuation for item 4 (43), so let's allocate item 4 to agent 2.
5. **Item 0** is left, and the highest available valuation is by agent 1 (80), but agent 1 already has item 2. The next highest is agent 0 with a valuation of 48. Let's allocate item 0 to agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the total value is reasonably maximized.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
