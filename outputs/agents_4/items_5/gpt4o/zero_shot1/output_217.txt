Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  22  68  93  97
1   2  37   7  14  66
2  89  40  97   5  96
3  55  40  14  49  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 40 14 49 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value of items assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's look at the valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 the most with a value of 97. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most with a value of 37. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most with a value of 97. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most with a value of 55. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have one more item (item 3) left to allocate. Let's allocate it based on the next highest available valuation:

5. **Agent 0** has the highest remaining valuation for item 3 with a value of 93. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
