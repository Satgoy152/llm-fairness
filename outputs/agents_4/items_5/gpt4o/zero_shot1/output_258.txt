Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  35  49  83   2
1  13  95  46  93  42
2  78  43  61  67  67
3  47  83  98  47  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 35 49 83  2]
 [13 95 46 93 42]
 [78 43 61 67 67]
 [47 83 98 47 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 3 (valuation 83)
2. Agent 1: Item 1 (valuation 95)
3. Agent 2: Item 0 (valuation 78)
4. Agent 3: Items 2 and 4 (valuations 98 and 71)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
