Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  13  71  33  34
1  13   6  99  33  90
2   1  96   9   2  29
3  16  47  33  92  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [16 47 33 92 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we will aim to maximize the value each agent receives from the items they are given. Let's examine the valuations for each agent and make allocations accordingly:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 71
  - Item 3: 33
  - Item 4: 34

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 13
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 33
  - Item 4: 90

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 96
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 2
  - Item 4: 29

- Agent 3 values:
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 47
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 92
  - Item 4: 28

We will prioritize giving each agent the item which corresponds to their highest valuation, ensuring each agent receives an item if possible:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 99) because it is the highest value for any agent.
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 (value 92) because it is the highest remaining value for Agent 3.
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (value 96) because it is the highest remaining value for Agent 2.
4. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (value 90) because it is the next highest value.
5. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 11) because it is the highest remaining value for Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives the items they value most highly, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
