Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  95  95  16  80
1  11  54  69  86  92
2  45  12  95  25  23
3  94   6  13  25  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by taking into account each agent's preferences. Given the valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and consider potential allocations:

- Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 2 (95 each).
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (92).
- Agent 2 highly values item 2 (95).
- Agent 3 highly values item 0 (94).

A reasonable allocation strategy could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

This leaves item 3 to be allocated. Since Agent 1 values item 3 relatively highly compared to other unallocated items, we assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
