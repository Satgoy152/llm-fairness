Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  58  20  18  78
1  90  49  38  70  56
2   8  74  23  99  85
3  17  75  37  49  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 58 20 18 78]
 [90 49 38 70 56]
 [ 8 74 23 99 85]
 [17 75 37 49 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations given in the table:

- Agent 0: 89, 58, 20, 18, 78
- Agent 1: 90, 49, 38, 70, 56
- Agent 2: 8, 74, 23, 99, 85
- Agent 3: 17, 75, 37, 49, 19

We'll aim to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations:

1. **Assign Item 0:** Agent 1 has the highest valuation (90).
2. **Assign Item 1:** Agent 3 has the second highest valuation (75).
3. **Assign Item 2:** Agent 1 has the highest valuation (38).
4. **Assign Item 3:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation (99).
5. **Assign Item 4:** Agent 2 has the second highest valuation (85).

Now, let's create the allocation based on the above assignments:

- Agent 0 doesn't receive any items.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 1.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
