Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  74  33  65  26
1  62  57  81  70  22
2  98   5  93  49  66
3  91   7  38  16  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 74 33 65 26]
 [62 57 81 70 22]
 [98  5 93 49 66]
 [91  7 38 16 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple algorithmic approach to maximize the total valuation. One common method is to use a greedy strategy, where we allocate items to the agent who values them the most, one item at a time.

Given the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  74  33  65  26
1  62  57  81  70  22
2  98   5  93  49  66
3  91   7  38  16  49
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 2 values it highest at 98.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it highest at 74.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 2 values it highest at 93 (next highest after already getting item 0).
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 1 values it highest at 70.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 2 values it highest at 66 (next highest after already getting items 0 and 2).
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

Resulting Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 4]
- Agent 3: []

In JSON format, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2, 4],
    "3": []
}
```
