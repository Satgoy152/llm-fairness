Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  24  28  70  73
1  86   5  68  18  49
2  62   0  85  95  84
3  16  35  14  43   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item for agent 0: Item 0 (96)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item for agent 1: Item 0 (86)
   - Second highest value item for agent 1: Item 2 (68)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item for agent 2: Item 3 (95)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value item for agent 3: Item 1 (35)

Based on these choices, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0
- Agent 1 gets item 2
- Agent 2 gets item 3
- Agent 3 gets item 1

However, since only 4 items are allocated here, and we need to allocate all 5 items, let's adjust this slightly while aiming for fairness:

- Agent 0 gets item 0
- Agent 1 gets item 4
- Agent 2 gets item 3
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 2

This allocation ensures all 5 items are distributed, and no agent receives more than 2 items while considering their highest values for allocated items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
