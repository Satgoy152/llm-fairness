Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  89  91  74  70
1  99  68  68  22  14
2  72  77   9  27  88
3  99   2  69  61  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10 89 91 74 70]
 [99 68 68 22 14]
 [72 77  9 27 88]
 [99  2 69 61 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most. Let's go through the items and allocate them accordingly:

- Item 0: The valuations are [10, 99, 72, 99]. Agent 1 and Agent 3 both value it at 99. We can give it to Agent 1.
- Item 1: The valuations are [89, 68, 77, 2]. Agent 0 values it the most at 89.
- Item 2: The valuations are [91, 68, 9, 69]. Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
- Item 3: The valuations are [74, 22, 27, 61]. Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
- Item 4: The valuations are [70, 14, 88, 62]. Agent 2 values it the most at 88.

Let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
