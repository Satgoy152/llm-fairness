Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  92  16  41  74
1  97  88  28  98  36
2  82  37  31  89  84
3  23   5  88  69  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 92 16 41 74]
 [97 88 28 98 36]
 [82 37 31 89 84]
 [23  5 88 69 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive two items.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:
- Agent 0 values item 1 highly with a valuation of 92.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly with a valuation of 98.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly with a valuation of 89.
- Agent 3 values item 2 highly with a valuation of 88.

Considering these valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's highest valuation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have one item left (item 0). We can assign it to the agent with the next highest valuation who has only one item. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0 (97), so we assign it to them.

The allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
