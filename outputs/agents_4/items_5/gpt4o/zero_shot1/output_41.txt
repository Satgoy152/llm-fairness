Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  15  28  22  64
1  39  57  15  89  33
2  47   0  90  85   6
3  30  99   6  93  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 67     | 15     | 28     | 22     | 64     |
| 1     | 39     | 57     | 15     | 89     | 33     |
| 2     | 47     | 0      | 90     | 85     | 6      |
| 3     | 30     | 99     | 6      | 93     | 52     |

To allocate fairly, we can follow these steps:

1. **Assign the highest-valued item to each agent first** (without overlapping):
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (67)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (89)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (90)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (99)

2. **Allocate the remaining item to the agent who values it the most and doesn't already have the highest value**:
   - Remaining item: Item 4.
   - Agent 0 values it at 64, which is the highest among those not already receiving their highest-valued item.
   
Thus, the allocations are as follows:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: Item [1]

Here's the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
