Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  63   2  58  42
1   3  93  20  75   7
2  25  27  48  35  86
3  57  15  99   8   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[45 63  2 58 42]
 [ 3 93 20 75  7]
 [25 27 48 35 86]
 [57 15 99  8  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. The goal is to try to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their individual preferences for the items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values item 1 the highest at 63.
- Agent 1: Values item 1 the highest at 93.
- Agent 2: Values item 4 the highest at 86.
- Agent 3: Values item 2 the highest at 99.

A possible allocation that maximizes total valuations could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since this is their highest value and they value it more than any other agent.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 since this is their highest value.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 since this is their highest value.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because it is their highest remaining valuation.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 as well to maximize their total valuation.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring all items are allocated.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
