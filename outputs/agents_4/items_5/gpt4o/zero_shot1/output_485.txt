Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  95  53   5  23
1  22  30  41  99  72
2  36  38   3   9   5
3  30   5  46   5  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each item is assigned to exactly one agent while trying to maximize the perceived value for each agent. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 1 provides the highest value (95) for Agent 0 compared to other agents' valuations for that item.
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 3 has the highest value (99) for Agent 1 compared to other agents' valuations for that item.
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 0 provides a decent value (36) for Agent 2, which is higher than Agent 3â€™s valuation for the same item.
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 4 provides the highest value (66) for Agent 3 compared to other agents' valuations for that item.
   - Item 2 can be assigned to Agent 3, as it has a decent value (46) and does not compromise significantly on the fairness of other allocations.

Now, the items are allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item that they value highly, while distributing the remaining items in a way that maintains fairness across all agents.
