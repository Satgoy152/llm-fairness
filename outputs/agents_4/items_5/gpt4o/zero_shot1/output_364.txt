Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  67  68  23  49
1  26  51  27  20  34
2  84  56  10  64  65
3  82  45  95  64   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. One common approach is to use a method that maximizes the minimum value that any agent receives, often called the "max-min fairness" approach. We can also consider the items' values for each agent to distribute them in a way that balances out the overall allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: 80, 67, 68, 23, 49
- Agent 1: 26, 51, 27, 20, 34
- Agent 2: 84, 56, 10, 64, 65
- Agent 3: 82, 45, 95, 64, 1

Given these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2 (84), so allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0 (67), so allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 3 (95), so allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.
4. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 2 (64), but Agent 2 already has Item 0, so allocate Item 3 to Agent 3 (64).
5. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 2 (65), but since Agent 2 already has an item, allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (49).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some value and all items are distributed. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
