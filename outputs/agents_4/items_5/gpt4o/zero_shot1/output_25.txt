Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  50  86  87  48
1  31  45  90  35   2
2  64  85   0  85  18
3  82  10  63  88  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 45 90 35  2]
 [64 85  0 85 18]
 [82 10 63 88 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (where possible) and all items are assigned.

One potential approach is to use the following steps:

1. **Identify the highest-valued item for each agent**, and allocate those items first, if possible.
2. **Ensure all items are allocated**, considering the next highest values if an item is already allocated.

Let's allocate the items to the agents:

1. Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 3 (value 87).
2. Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 2 (value 90).
3. Agent 2's highest valuation is also item 1 (value 85).
4. Agent 3's highest valuation is for item 3 (value 88) but since item 3 is already taken, the next highest is item 0 (value 82).

Consider the allocations:
- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 1
- **Agent 3**: Item 0

Now, only item 4 is left:
- Check which agent values item 4 the most: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 48
  - Agent 1 values it at 2
  - Agent 2 values it at 18
  - Agent 3 values it at 64

Thus, item 4 should be assigned to Agent 3.

Now, the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
