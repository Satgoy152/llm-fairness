Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  89  51   1  56
1  45  41  91  71  61
2   7  53  18  18   4
3  18  57  45  54  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 53 18 18  4]
 [18 57 45 54 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We'll use a strategy to try to give each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  89  51   1  56
1  45  41  91  71  61
2   7  53  18  18   4
3  18  57  45  54  19
```

We'll start by identifying which agent values each item the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (87).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (89).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (91).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (71).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (61).

Now we need to ensure that items are distributed fairly:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 0).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 1).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 2).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (next highest value for item 3 after Agent 1).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 4).

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent that values it the most, while balancing the distribution fairly.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4, and Agent 3 receives item 3. Agent 2 does not receive any items, as there are only 5 items and the allocation maximizes the total valuation.
