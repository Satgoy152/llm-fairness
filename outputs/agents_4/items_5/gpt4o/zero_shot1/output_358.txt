Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  15  65  95  24
1  68  74  25  58  75
2  87   3  66   6  59
3  38  31   6  31  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 15 65 95 24]
 [68 74 25 58 75]
 [87  3 66  6 59]
 [38 31  6 31 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction across agents, taking into account each agent's valuations for the items. We will ensure that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and that all items are allocated.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  15  65  95  24
1  68  74  25  58  75
2  87   3  66   6  59
3  38  31   6  31  25
```

Letâ€™s assess which agent values each item the most and allocate accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 87 by Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 74 by Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 66 by Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 75 by Agent 1.

Now, we will assign items based on these valuations:

- Agent 0 receives Item 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 3 receives no items, as they have the lowest valuations overall.

This allocation ensures that items are distributed to maximize the overall value to the agents based on their individual preferences.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": []
}
```
