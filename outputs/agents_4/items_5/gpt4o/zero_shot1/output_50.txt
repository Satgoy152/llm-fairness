Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  16   0  77  21
1   5  52  34  88  97
2   5  94  14  59  64
3  90  23  44  36  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given the valuations provided, let's consider a strategy where we allocate items based on the highest value an agent has for an item, ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here are the agent valuations:

- Agent 0: [66, 16, 0, 77, 21]
- Agent 1: [5, 52, 34, 88, 97]
- Agent 2: [5, 94, 14, 59, 64]
- Agent 3: [90, 23, 44, 36, 29]

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 values it the highest at 90.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest at 94.
3. Item 2: Agent 3 values it at 44, which is the highest for any agent valuing item 2.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 77.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 97.

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is as fair as possible based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
