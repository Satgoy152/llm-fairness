Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  37   1  53  96  89
1  65  81  36  41  48
2  79  31  32  35  19
3  64  27  51  21   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value derived from the items by all agents, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use the "maximum sum of values" method, where each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most.

Here's how the allocation can be done based on the given values:

1. For item 0, the values are: 
   - Agent 0: 37
   - Agent 1: 65
   - Agent 2: 79
   - Agent 3: 64
   Agent 2 values item 0 the most.

2. For item 1, the values are:
   - Agent 0: 1
   - Agent 1: 81
   - Agent 2: 31
   - Agent 3: 27
   Agent 1 values item 1 the most.

3. For item 2, the values are:
   - Agent 0: 53
   - Agent 1: 36
   - Agent 2: 32
   - Agent 3: 51
   Agent 0 values item 2 the most.

4. For item 3, the values are:
   - Agent 0: 96
   - Agent 1: 41
   - Agent 2: 35
   - Agent 3: 21
   Agent 0 values item 3 the most.

5. For item 4, the values are:
   - Agent 0: 89
   - Agent 1: 48
   - Agent 2: 19
   - Agent 3: 3
   Agent 0 values item 4 the most.

Based on this allocation strategy, here is the distribution of items to agents:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation assigns all items to the agents based on the maximum values they have for each item.
