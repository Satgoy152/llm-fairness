Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  44  60  30  35
1   3  49  26  57  46
2  79  12  26  68  66
3  56  20  46  56  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 20 46 56 18]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider the valuations provided and aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We can use a heuristic approach to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items. Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (60).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (57).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (79).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (56), but it's already assigned to Agent 2. Next highest unique item is 2 (46), but it's already assigned to Agent 0.
   - Next highest unique is item 3 (56), but it's already assigned to Agent 1.
   - Next highest unique is item 4 (18).

Next, we look at the second highest preferences for each agent for items that haven't been assigned yet:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Second highest unique available item is 4 (35).

- **Agent 1**:
  - Second highest unique available item is 1 (49).

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated:

- **Item 0**: Assigned to Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Assigned to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Assigned to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Assigned to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Assigned to Agent 0.

Finally, let's structure the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned exactly once and the assignments are based on maximizing the agents' valuations for the items they receive.
