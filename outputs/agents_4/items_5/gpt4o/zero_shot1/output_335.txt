Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12   2   6  34   7
1  84  71   1  88  44
2  69  73  77  50  55
3  55  91  75  97  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 71  1 88 44]
 [69 73 77 50 55]
 [55 91 75 97 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent derives from the items they receive. Let's evaluate potential allocations by considering each agent's highest-valued items first, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no item is assigned more than once.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [12, 2, 6, 34, 7]
- Agent 1: [84, 71, 1, 88, 44]
- Agent 2: [69, 73, 77, 50, 55]
- Agent 3: [55, 91, 75, 97, 98]

Now, let's allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total received value:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 4 (98), so allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation, for item 3 (88), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most (77), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (12), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 2** has the next highest valuation that is not yet allocated, for item 1 (73), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a meaningful item based on their highest valuations while distributing all 5 items among the agents.
