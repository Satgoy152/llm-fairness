Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  52  80  98  24
1  26  93   6   8  86
2  89  56  61  36  90
3  45  97  21  40  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 93  6  8 86]
 [89 56 61 36 90]
 [45 97 21 40 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

- Assign item 3 to agent 0, as agent 0 values item 3 the highest (98).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 values item 1 the highest (93).
- Assign item 0 to agent 2, as agent 2 values item 0 the highest (89).
- Assign item 4 to agent 3, as agent 3 values item 4 the highest (91).
- Assign item 2 to agent 0, as agent 0 also values item 2 highly (80).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents and attempts to give each agent an item they value highly. 

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
