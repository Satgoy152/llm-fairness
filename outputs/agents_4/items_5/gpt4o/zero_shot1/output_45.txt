Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  61  38  64   9
1   5  83  43  84  54
2  17  39  22  94  13
3  13  43  77  38   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

One approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 67
   - Agent 1 values it at 5
   - Agent 2 values it at 17
   - Agent 3 values it at 13
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 67)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 61
   - Agent 1 values it at 83
   - Agent 2 values it at 39
   - Agent 3 values it at 43
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 83)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38
   - Agent 1 values it at 43
   - Agent 2 values it at 22
   - Agent 3 values it at 77
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (highest value: 77)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 64
   - Agent 1 values it at 84
   - Agent 2 values it at 94
   - Agent 3 values it at 38
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 94)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 54
   - Agent 2 values it at 13
   - Agent 3 values it at 9
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 54)

After assigning the items, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it most highly, while also distributing all 5 items among the agents.
