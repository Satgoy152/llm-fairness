Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  80   8  83  89
1  50  68  33  38  29
2  24  19  36  93   4
3  28  10  74  24   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 80  8 83 89]
 [50 68 33 38 29]
 [24 19 36 93  4]
 [28 10 74 24  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Each agent should receive at least one item, and the total allocation should be exactly 5 items.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: 90, 80, 8, 83, 89
Agent 1: 50, 68, 33, 38, 29
Agent 2: 24, 19, 36, 93, 4
Agent 3: 28, 10, 74, 24, 4
```

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0 and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 2.

A fair allocation strategy is to assign each agent the item they value the most. Let's assign as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 4 (valuations 90 and 89)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (valuation 68)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (valuation 93)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (valuation 74)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total value extracted from the items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation sums up to 5 items in total, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
