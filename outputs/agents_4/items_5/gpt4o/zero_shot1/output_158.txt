Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  17   7  19  35
1  80  76  30  82   1
2   9  93  71  68   4
3  48  72  73   2  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** Values items as follows - 0: 2, 1: 17, 2: 7, 3: 19, 4: 35.
2. **Agent 1:** Values items as follows - 0: 80, 1: 76, 2: 30, 3: 82, 4: 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Values items as follows - 0: 9, 1: 93, 2: 71, 3: 68, 4: 4.
4. **Agent 3:** Values items as follows - 0: 48, 1: 72, 2: 73, 3: 2, 4: 18.

Let's consider the highest value each agent places on any item and allocate accordingly:

- **Agent 0:** Highest value on item 4 (35).
- **Agent 1:** Highest value on item 3 (82).
- **Agent 2:** Highest value on item 1 (93).
- **Agent 3:** Highest value on item 2 (73).

Now, allocate the remaining item (item 0) to the agent that has not yet received an item or values it the most among unallocated items:

- **Agent 1:** Values item 0 the most (80).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated while considering the valuations.
