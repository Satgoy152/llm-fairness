Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  76  23  61  41
1  79  86  62  14  19
2  41  27  43  75  46
3  46  75  14  86  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an item (if possible), given that there are only 5 items and 4 agents.

We can start by assigning the highest valued item from each agent's perspective. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most at 76.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most at 86, but it's already taken, so we look at their next highest value, which is item 0 at 79.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most at 75.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the most at 86, but it's already taken, so we look at their next highest value, which is item 1 at 75, but it's taken, so we go to item 4 at 70.

Now we have assigned:
- Item 1 to Agent 0
- Item 0 to Agent 1
- Item 3 to Agent 2
- Item 4 to Agent 3

One item remains (item 2), and we should allocate it to the agent who can derive the most value from it and hasn't been assigned any item yet.

Item 2:
- Agent 0 values it at 23 (already has an item).
- Agent 1 values it at 62 (already has an item).
- Agent 2 values it at 43 (already has an item).
- Agent 3 values it at 14.

Since all agents already have one item each, we need to ensure that all items are used, and we haven't assigned an item to Agent 3 yet. Therefore, it would be reasonable to allocate:

- Item 2 to Agent 3.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
