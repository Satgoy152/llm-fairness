Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  74  50   1  75
1  98  36  58  30   1
2  55  33  48  28   3
3   9  91  65  24  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 33 48 28  3]
 [ 9 91 65 24 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value perceived by all agents. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 98.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 91.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 65.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 75.

Based on the above analysis, the allocation of items to the agents is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, maximizing the total value perceived by all agents combined.
