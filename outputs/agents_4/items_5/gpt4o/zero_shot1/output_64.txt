Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  86  66  85  50
1  47  13   7   6   0
2  96  29  54  17  42
3  25  78  55  66  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 29 54 17 42]
 [25 78 55 66 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [2, 86, 66, 85, 50]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [47, 13, 7, 6, 0]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [96, 29, 54, 17, 42]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [25, 78, 55, 66, 70]

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

- Assign the highest valued item for each agent while ensuring that no item is assigned more than once.

1. **Item 0**:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (96)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (86)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (66) - already assigned an item
   - Next highest value: Agent 3 (55)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 3

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (85) - already assigned an item
   - Next highest value: Agent 3 (66) - already assigned an item
   - Next highest value: Agent 2 (17) - already assigned an item
   - Next highest value: Agent 1 (6)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (70) - already assigned an item
   - Next highest value: Agent 0 (50) - already assigned an item
   - Next highest value: Agent 2 (42) - already assigned an item
   - Next highest value: Agent 1 (0) - already assigned an item
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that maximize their individual valuations given the constraints, and all 5 items are allocated.
