Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  22  23  78   8
1  40  46  98  40  61
2  62  78   0  99  22
3  24  96  80  39  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 96 80 39 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their satisfaction (value), we can use a variation of the "maximum-weight matching" problem in bipartite graphs. This involves finding a way to assign items to agents so that the total value is maximized.

Let's look at the table of valuations and try to allocate items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the items, ensuring that each item is only allocated once:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (98), so let's allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 highly (98), so let's allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly (99), so let's allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 highly (96), so let's allocate item 1 to agent 3.
5. Item 4 is left, and agent 1 values it moderately high (61), so let's allocate item 4 to agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 0
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 4
- Agent 2 gets item 3
- Agent 3 gets item 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
