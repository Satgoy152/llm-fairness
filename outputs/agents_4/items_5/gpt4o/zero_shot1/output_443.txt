Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  14  41  86   2
1  86  51  13  88  84
2  26  55  16  74  95
3  98  78  38  70  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we have to consider the valuations of the items by each agent and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Additionally, all 5 items must be allocated. We aim to maximize the total satisfaction or value for the agents.

Let's try to allocate the items based on the maximum value each agent assigns to them:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valued item is item 3 (value 86).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valued item is item 3 (value 88), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 0 (value 86).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valued item is item 4 (value 95).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valued item is item 0 (value 98), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 1 (value 78).

Now, let's assign the remaining items by reevaluating:

- Item 2 (not yet allocated): 
  - Agent 0: Value 41
  - Agent 1: Value 13
  - Agent 2: Value 16
  - Agent 3: Value 38
  - Assign to Agent 0 (higher value among unallocated items)

- Item 1 (not yet allocated):
  - Already assigned to Agent 3 based on their next highest preference.

The final allocation based on maximizing individual preferences while ensuring all items are distributed is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated without any conflicts based on their highest preferences.
