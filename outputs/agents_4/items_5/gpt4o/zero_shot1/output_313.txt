Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  90  67  27  21
1  12  81  72   1   6
2  65  57  10  22  69
3  91   1  68  27   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[19 90 67 27 21]
 [12 81 72  1  6]
 [65 57 10 22 69]
 [91  1 68 27  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. One common approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum bipartite matching" where we try to match items to agents such that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations for chosen pairs) is maximized. 

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0: Value = 27
2. Assign item 0 to agent 3: Value = 91
3. Assign item 1 to agent 1: Value = 81
4. Assign item 4 to agent 2: Value = 69
5. Assign item 2 to agent 1: Value = 72

This allocation is chosen to ensure that each agent receives an item that they value relatively highly, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
