Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  88  17  36   5
1  60  43  61   5  90
2  40  45  79   4  55
3  57  65  73  44  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 45 79  4 55]
 [57 65 73 44 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible). We also need to ensure that all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: Item 0 (44), Item 1 (88), Item 2 (17), Item 3 (36), Item 4 (5)
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is Item 1 (88).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: Item 0 (60), Item 1 (43), Item 2 (61), Item 3 (5), Item 4 (90)
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is Item 4 (90).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: Item 0 (40), Item 1 (45), Item 2 (79), Item 3 (4), Item 4 (55)
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is Item 2 (79).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: Item 0 (57), Item 1 (65), Item 2 (73), Item 3 (44), Item 4 (96)
   - Highest value for Agent 3 is Item 4 (96), but it's already allocated. The next highest is Item 2 (73), but it's also allocated. The next one is Item 1 (65).

Given this analysis, let's allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 3 (since Item 1 is taken and Item 2 is taken).
- For Agent 3, Item 3 is the next best choice since Item 4 is taken.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Items 0, 3

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
