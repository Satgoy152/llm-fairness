Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  88   0   9  19
1  31  62  12   1  73
2  16  70  89   7  57
3  16  32  89  25   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16 70 89  7 57]
 [16 32 89 25  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider a distribution that maximizes total valuation while trying to ensure fairness. Given the valuations, let's first identify the most valued items for each agent and try to distribute the items accordingly.

Here is the valuation matrix for each agent:

- Agent 0: [99, 88, 0, 9, 19]
- Agent 1: [31, 62, 12, 1, 73]
- Agent 2: [16, 70, 89, 7, 57]
- Agent 3: [16, 32, 89, 25, 2]

Let's attempt to allocate the items such that each agent gets at least one of their higher valued items, if possible:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (99) and item 1 (88). We can allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (73). We can allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (89). We can allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (89) as well, but since Agent 2 already has item 2, we consider the next highest value. Agent 3 also has a high value for item 3 (25), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 2, 3, and 4. We have one remaining item, item 1, which needs to be allocated:

- **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 0 (88) and moderately by Agent 2 (70), but since Agent 0 already has item 0, we will try to allocate it to another agent for fairness.

Given Agent 0 already has an item, let's consider Agent 2, who values it at 70, and Agent 1, who values it at 62. Allocating item 1 to Agent 2 seems fair as it maximizes valuation overall.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [1, 2]
- Agent 3: [3]

JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
