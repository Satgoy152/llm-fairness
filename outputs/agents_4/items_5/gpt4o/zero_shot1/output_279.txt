Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  70  66  27  49
1  16   3  17   6   8
2  25  24  10  78  32
3  72  57  34  40  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided.

Here is a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most, so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most, so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most, so assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most, so assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. Finally, assign item 0 to the agent with the highest valuation for it, which is Agent 3.

Now, let's format the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
