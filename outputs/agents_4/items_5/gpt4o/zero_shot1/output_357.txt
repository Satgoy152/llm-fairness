Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  31  84   1  92
1  31  11  82  87  69
2  71  94  73  17  67
3  74  44  46  54  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We have 5 items and 4 agents.
   - We need to ensure each agent can be fairly satisfied with the item they receive.

2. **Allocation Process:**
   - **Agent 0:** The highest value for agent 0 is item 4 with a valuation of 92.
   - **Agent 1:** The highest value for agent 1 is item 3 with a valuation of 87.
   - **Agent 2:** The highest value for agent 2 is item 1 with a valuation of 94.
   - **Agent 3:** The highest value for agent 3 is item 0 with a valuation of 74.

3. **Resulting Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4
   - Agent 1: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Item 1
   - Agent 3: Item 0
   - Item 2 is unallocated, so we need to find the next best agent for item 2.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 2 also has high value (73) for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to agent 2 for maximum total valuation.

5. **Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
