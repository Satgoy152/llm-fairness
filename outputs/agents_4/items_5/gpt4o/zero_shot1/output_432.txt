Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  90  13  53  60
1  85  61  86  52  83
2  13  51  63   9  91
3  93  63  29   0  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [93 63 29  0 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. Let's use a simple greedy algorithm to allocate the items:

1. Start by listing the valuations of each agent for each item.
2. Sort the potential allocations based on the valuations in descending order.
3. Allocate the items one by one, ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent and each agent receives at most one item.
4. Continue until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0: 39
   - Agent 1: 85
   - Agent 2: 13
   - Agent 3: 93 (highest valuation)

   Allocate Item 0 to Agent 3.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0: 90 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 1: 61
   - Agent 2: 51
   - Agent 3: (already has an item)

   Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0: 13
   - Agent 1: 86 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2: 63
   - Agent 3: (already has an item)

   Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0: 53
   - Agent 1: 52
   - Agent 2: 9
   - Agent 3: (already has an item)

   Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0: (already has two items)
   - Agent 1: 83 (highest remaining valuation)
   - Agent 2: 91 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 3: (already has an item)

   Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
