Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70   4  28  96   2
1  35  57  24  88  81
2  38  35  47  40  33
3  59  22  28  84  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can try to allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for different items, while also considering the overall balance among agents.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 96
  - Item 4: 2

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 57
  - Item 2: 24
  - Item 3: 88
  - Item 4: 81

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 38
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 40
  - Item 4: 33

- Agent 3 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 22
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 84
  - Item 4: 24

Let's allocate items to maximize total value:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 3 (96). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for Item 4 (81). Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 2 (47). Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for Item 0 (59). Assign Item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Now, Item 1 is left. Agent 1 values it the most (57), so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation fairly distributes the items while considering each agent's preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
