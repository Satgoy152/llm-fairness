Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  27  48  72   6
1  53  70  71  36  39
2  16  17   4  11  16
3   9  43  95  72  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as optimal as possible based on the given valuations. A common approach is to maximize the total value or ensure that each agent receives at least one item (if possible). Let's try to allocate the items such that each agent maximizes their valuation, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing individual agent valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 0 with a value of 87.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 2 with a value of 71.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 1 with a value of 17.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 3 with a value of 95.

So far, we've allocated items 0, 1, 2, and 3. The remaining item is item 4.

5. We need to allocate item 4. The highest valuation for item 4 is from agent 3 with a value of 36.

Now, each agent has been assigned items based on their highest valuations, ensuring a fair distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations given the constraints.
