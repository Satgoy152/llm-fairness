Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  29  43   3  44
1   2  55  86  88  66
2   8   8  84  37  14
3  12  17  68  80  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. We'll attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives an item they highly value, if possible, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (76), so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (88), so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (84), so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (74), so we allocate item 4 to agent 3.

This leaves item 1 unallocated. Among the remaining agents, agent 1 values item 1 the most (55), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.

Below is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

Thus, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
