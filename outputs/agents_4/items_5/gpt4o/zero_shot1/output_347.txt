Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  93  98  46  62
1  19  52  18  95  84
2  12  32  19  99  87
3  90  17   0  64  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, let's consider a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. We'll aim to distribute five items among four agents.

Here's a step-by-step approach to reach a fair allocation:

1. **Understand the Valuations**: 
    - Agent 0: [13, 93, 98, 46, 62]
    - Agent 1: [19, 52, 18, 95, 84]
    - Agent 2: [12, 32, 19, 99, 87]
    - Agent 3: [90, 17, 0, 64, 31]

2. **Identify the Highest Valuations**: 
   Let's examine each agent's highest-valued item:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (98).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (95).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (99).
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the most (90).

3. **Allocate the Items Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Since both Agent 1 and Agent 2 value item 3 the highest, we'll have to decide based on the next highest valuation. Agent 2's next highest is item 4 (87), whereas Agent 1's next highest is item 4 (84).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (99), as it is the highest single valuation.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (98), as it's the highest valuation for Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (90), as it's the highest valuation for Agent 3.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (84), since Agent 1 needs an item and item 4 is their next highest.
   - The last item left is item 1. Allocate it to the agent who hasn't yet received an item or who values it the next highest.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their second highest valuation after item 2.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, Agent 1 receives item 4, Agent 2 receives item 3, and Agent 3 receives item 0. This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated fairly based on the highest valuation.
