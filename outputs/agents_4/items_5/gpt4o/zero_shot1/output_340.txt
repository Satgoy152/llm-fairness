Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  15  45   1   5
1  59  61  45  21  34
2   5  45  18  73  63
3  45  17  63  73  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [45 17 63 73 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of allocated items is 5. We can aim to maximize the total satisfaction by considering each agent's preferences for the items.

Here's the valuation table for clarity:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 88     | 15     | 45     | 1      | 5      |
| 1     | 59     | 61     | 45     | 21     | 34     |
| 2     | 5      | 45     | 18     | 73     | 63     |
| 3     | 45     | 17     | 63     | 73     | 87     |

A potential approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 88.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 61.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 63.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 73.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 87.

Let's allocate the items based on these preferences:

- **Agent 0** gets Item 0.
- **Agent 1** gets Item 1.
- **Agent 2** gets Item 3.
- **Agent 3** gets Items 2 and 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and the total number of allocated items is 5.
