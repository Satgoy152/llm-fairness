Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  84   7  34  77
1  82  92  49  94  50
2   0  16  94  89  72
3  35  93  14  76  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. One potential approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each item is only allocated to one agent. Here's how it can be done:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest with a valuation of 82.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the highest with a valuation of 93.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest with a valuation of 94.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest with a valuation of 94.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest with a valuation of 77.

With this allocation strategy, we ensure that each item is given to the agent who values it the most and each agent gets at least one item (except for Agent 3). Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each of the 5 items is assigned to one agent, and all agents are considered in the allocation process.
