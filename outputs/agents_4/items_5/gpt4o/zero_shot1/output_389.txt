Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  26  34   9  43
1  36  19  17  49  91
2  17  98  25  74   4
3  55  27  23  57  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations of the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's analyze the table:

```
      0   1   2   3   4
  0  27  26  34   9  43
  1  36  19  17  49  91
  2  17  98  25  74   4
  3  55  27  23  57  20
```

One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 4 (91), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
2. Agent 2 highly values item 1 (98), so assign item 1 to agent 2.
3. Agent 0 highly values item 4 but it's already allocated, so the next highest for agent 0 is item 2 (34).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 0 (55), so assign item 0 to agent 3.
5. For the remaining item 3, it can be assigned to agent 1 (49) since it maximizes the remaining valuation.

After assigning the items, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```
