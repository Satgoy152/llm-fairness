Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  95  99  15  39
1  24  34  86  20  59
2  46  11  39  86  15
3  93  74  95  84  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[46 95 99 15 39]
 [24 34 86 20 59]
 [46 11 39 86 15]
 [93 74 95 84 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 5 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the others will receive one item each. Let's consider the valuations and make allocations accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Values: [46, 95, 99, 15, 39]
   - Highest value: Item 2 (99)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [24, 34, 86, 20, 59]
   - Highest value: Item 2 (86) (already given to Agent 0), next highest: Item 4 (59)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [46, 11, 39, 86, 15]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (86)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [93, 74, 95, 84, 59]
   - Highest value: Item 0 (93)

Now let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has one item (Item 2).
- Agent 1 has one item (Item 4).
- Agent 2 has one item (Item 3).
- Agent 3 has one item (Item 0).

For the remaining item, we can look at the remaining highest values:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (95), which is the highest among the remaining options for any agent.

Thus, we can allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
