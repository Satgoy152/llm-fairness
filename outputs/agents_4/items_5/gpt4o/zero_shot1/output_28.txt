Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  99  63  69  25
1  54  41  71  96  30
2  68  79  60  41  56
3  11  51   0  90  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One possible approach is to assign items to agents by considering each agent's highest-valued item that has not yet been assigned, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Look for the highest valued items for each agent and assign them if they are not already assigned.
2. Ensure that each item is assigned to only one agent, and each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations.

Let's break down the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1 (99) and item 0 (78).
- Agent 1 highly values item 3 (96).
- Agent 2 highly values item 1 (79) and item 0 (68).
- Agent 3 highly values item 3 (90) and item 4 (69).

Let's allocate the items based on these preferences:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).

Now, we have assigned four items. The final item, 2, should be allocated to maximize fairness:

5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest available value for Agent 0).

Now, all items are assigned, and we have ensured that each agent has a fair allocation based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
