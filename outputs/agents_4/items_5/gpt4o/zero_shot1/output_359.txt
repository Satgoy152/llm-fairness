Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  35  61  43  66
1  42   0  73  89  28
2  14  10  95  43  46
3  74  43   2  24   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated. We aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent given the constraints.

Here are the valuations broken down for each agent:
- Agent 0: [10, 35, 61, 43, 66]
- Agent 1: [42, 0, 73, 89, 28]
- Agent 2: [14, 10, 95, 43, 46]
- Agent 3: [74, 43, 2, 24, 8]

A potential allocation strategy is as follows:
1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, who values it highly at 89.
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, who has the highest valuation of 95.
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3, who has the highest valuation of 74.
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, who values it at 66, more than any other item.
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, who values it at 0, but it balances their allocation, or alternatively, item 1 can go to Agent 0 for more balanced distribution.

Thus, a fair allocation, considering the goal of maximizing value for each agent, could be:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has a fair share based on their preferences while using all 5 items. The allocation attempts to maximize individual satisfaction based on the given valuations.
