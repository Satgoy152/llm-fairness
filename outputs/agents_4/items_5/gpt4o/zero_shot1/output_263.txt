Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  37  12  50  19
1  56  96  74  89  19
2  12  49  70  64  71
3  87  21   8   7   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 49 70 64 71]
 [87 21  8  7  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by considering their preferences. A common approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent can get at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  37  12  50  19
1  56  96  74  89  19
2  12  49  70  64  71
3  87  21   8   7   6
```

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the most with 87.
2. Item 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most with 96.
3. Item 2:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most with 74.
4. Item 3:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most with 89.
5. Item 4:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most with 71.

Now we have:

- Agent 1 values item 1, 2, and 3 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most.

To ensure a fair distribution among all agents (as possible), we can adjust as follows:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

This leads to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated and distributed fairly based on the highest valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item if it aligns with their interest.
