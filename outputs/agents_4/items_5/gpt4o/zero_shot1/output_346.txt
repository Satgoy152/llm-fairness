Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  21  83  73   0
1  44  16  75  32   8
2  58  77  72  48  83
3  88  80  27  43  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 16 75 32  8]
 [58 77 72 48 83]
 [88 80 27 43 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider the valuations given in the table and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied to an extent, considering the constraints.

Here's an allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (83) and item 0 (80).
- Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 2 (75).
- Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 4 (83).
- Agent 3 highly values item 0 (88) and item 1 (80).

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 83).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 88).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 80).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 83).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 32).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation respects the total of 5 items being distributed.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
