Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  34  61  48  30
1  53  22  13  63   9
2  18  61  45  51   7
3  28  15  66  77  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider an approach that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each gets at least one item. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 (61) the most among the items.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 3 (63) the most.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 1 (61) the most.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 values item 3 (77) the most, but since item 3 is already taken, the next highest is item 2 (66).

After the initial allocation, we have:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 4

This allocation covers all items except item 0. Now, we need to allocate item 0.

- **Review remaining options**: Item 0 is valued 6 by Agent 0, 53 by Agent 1, 18 by Agent 2, and 28 by Agent 3.
- Since Agent 1 values item 0 the highest among the remaining options, we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that every item is distributed, and agents have received allocations based on their highest preferences.
