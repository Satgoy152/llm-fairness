Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  61  99  41  20
1  58  33  16  65  51
2  86  79  43  91   7
3  61  78  17  93  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their individual preferences, we can use a method based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Below is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Observations**: Each agent values the items differently, and we aim to allocate one item to each agent fairly.

2. **Agent Preferences**:
   - Agent 0's highest valued item is item 2 (value 99).
   - Agent 1's highest valued item is item 3 (value 65).
   - Agent 2's highest valued item is item 3 (value 91).
   - Agent 3's highest valued item is item 3 (value 93).

3. **Allocating Items**:
   - Since item 3 is the most preferred item by multiple agents (agents 1, 2, and 3), we need to decide who gets it. Agent 3 values it the most, so we give item 3 to agent 3.
   - For agent 0, the next highest valued item after item 2 (which is highly contested) is item 1. Therefore, allocate item 1 to agent 0.
   - For agent 1, with item 3 allocated, the next highest valued item is item 0. Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
   - For agent 2, with item 3 allocated to someone else, allocate item 2, which is the next highest valued item.
   - The remaining item, item 4, goes to agent 3, who already has item 3.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [1]
   - Agent 1: [0]
   - Agent 2: [2]
   - Agent 3: [3, 4]

5. **JSON Format**:
Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
