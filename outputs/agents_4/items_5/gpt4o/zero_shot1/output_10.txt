Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  66  75  64  71
1  70  15  49  14  22
2  57  34  12   6  38
3  53  33  46  96  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve that:

- **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.
- **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 0, but item 0 is better suited for Agent 0.
- **Agent 2**: Has relatively low valuations across all items.
- **Agent 3**: Has a high valuation for item 3.

Based on these observations, a possible allocation would be:

- Give **item 0** to **Agent 0** because they highly value it.
- Give **item 2** to **Agent 0** because they highly value it.
- Give **item 4** to **Agent 0** because they highly value it.
- Give **item 1** to **Agent 1** because it's relatively the best for them.
- Give **item 3** to **Agent 3** because they highly value it.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are fairly distributed.
