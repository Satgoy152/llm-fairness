Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  45  23   0  68
1  33  99  71  45  35
2  63  92  77  89  54
3  63  99  82  97  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.
    
Model: GPT4o
Type of distribution: uniform
Temperature: 0.7
Prompt type: zero_shot1
Valuation Table:
[[43 45 23  0 68]
 [33 99 71 45 35]
 [63 92 77 89 54]
 [63 99 82 97 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We have 4 agents and 5 items to allocate, ensuring each item is allocated to one agent, and no agent receives more than 2 items (since \( \lfloor 5/4 \rfloor = 1\) and 1 item is the minimum number per agent).

Below is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (68).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 1 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 3 (89).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 2 (82).

In this distribution, each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 4. Since there is one more item to allocate and agent 0 has no item yet, we can give item 0 to agent 0 (value 43) who values it more than any other unallocated item.

The allocation becomes:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 2

Now, let's present this allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```
