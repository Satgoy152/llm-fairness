Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  41  59  36  44
1   3  69  58   7  18
2  63  78  63  75  31
3  99  22  29  33  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 22 29 33 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We will use a greedy approach to optimize the distribution based on the given valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value for agent 0 is item 0 with a value of 85.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for agent 1 is item 1 with a value of 69.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value for agent 2 is item 1 with a value of 78, but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest value for agent 2 is item 3 with a value of 75.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value for agent 3 is item 0 with a value of 99, but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest value for agent 3 is remaining item 4 with a value of 49.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 3.

5. **Allocate Remaining Item:**
   - The only unallocated item is item 2.
   - Item 2 has the highest remaining value for agent 0 with a value of 59.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that maximizes their individual valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
