Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  50  20  19  99
1  18  17  28  67  86
2  72  38  35  95  62
3  74  67  57   9  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are four agents and five items, one agent will not receive any items. Hereâ€™s an approach to determine the allocations:

1. **Assign the highest value item to an agent who values it the most**: 
    - Item 0: Highest value is 89 (Agent 0).
    - Item 1: Highest value is 50 (Agent 0).
    - Item 2: Highest value is 35 (Agent 2).
    - Item 3: Highest value is 95 (Agent 2).
    - Item 4: Highest value is 99 (Agent 0).

2. **Allocate based on the above values**:
    - Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 4.
    - Agent 2 values item 3 highly.
    - Agent 2 values item 2 the most after item 3.

3. **Avoid duplication and ensure allocation of all items**:
    - Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.
    - Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 2.
    - Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Allocate remaining items**:
    - Agent 1 and Agent 3 will not receive items as they have relatively lower valuations compared to Agents 0 and 2.
    - This leaves Agent 1 and Agent 3 without items.

5. **Final Allocation**:
    - Agent 0: Items 0, 4
    - Agent 1: []
    - Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 3
    - Agent 3: []

Based on this reasoning, the allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 2, 3],
    "3": []
}
```
