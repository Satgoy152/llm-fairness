Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  75  70  69  50
1  34  33  94  81  44
2  88  53  81  35  20
3  65   1   7  75   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 33 94 81 44]
 [88 53 81 35 20]
 [65  1  7 75  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and only 5 items are allocated in total.

Let's analyze the table and attempt to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:** [4, 75, 70, 69, 50]
2. **Agent 1's valuations:** [34, 33, 94, 81, 44]
3. **Agent 2's valuations:** [88, 53, 81, 35, 20]
4. **Agent 3's valuations:** [65, 1, 7, 75, 4]

The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items where they are valued the most by any agent.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign the highest valued item to the respective agent.
- Ensure no more than 5 items are allocated in total.

### Allocation Steps:
1. **Item 2** is highly valued by **Agent 1** with 94.
2. **Item 0** is highly valued by **Agent 2** with 88.
3. **Item 1** is highly valued by **Agent 0** with 75.
4. **Item 3** is highly valued by **Agent 3** with 75.
5. **Item 4** can be assigned to **Agent 0** with a valuation of 50, as it maximizes the satisfaction.

These allocations ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, leading to a fair distribution.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 5 items among the agents in a manner that maximizes the total valuation.
