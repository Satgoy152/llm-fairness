Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  61   1  54  91
1  52  49  94  73  92
2  27  98  73  77  79
3  59  44  49  60  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their individual satisfaction, we can analyze each agent's valuations and attempt to assign items so that each agent gets optimal utility. Let's start by examining the highest value each agent places on items and try to distribute accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for item 4 (91) and item 0 (70).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for item 2 (94) and item 4 (92).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for item 1 (98) and item 3 (77).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for item 0 (59) and item 3 (60).

Let's try to assign items by prioritizing the highest valuation:

- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 70, better than Agent 3's 59).
- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 98, highest value).
- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 94, highest value).
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 77, second highest for Agent 2).
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 92, second highest for Agent 1).

Now, let's check if every item is allocated and each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 3: No items

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent is assigned items based on their highest valuation, and all 5 items are distributed.
