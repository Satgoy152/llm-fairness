Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  74  87  64  76
1  40  23  51   1  48
2  25  48  98  92  78
3  67  37  94  93  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 48 98 92 78]
 [67 37 94 93 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation. One approach is to use a method similar to the "Hungarian algorithm" or simply look for the maximum valuation for each item and assign it to the corresponding agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Hereâ€™s one way to do it:

1. **Find the highest valuation for each item** and assign the item to the corresponding agent if that agent doesn't already have an item, or if it doesn't interfere with previous assignments.
2. If conflicts arise (i.e., an agent already has an item but is the highest bidder for another), assign the item to the next highest bidder for whom this is not the case.

Let's apply this logic to the table:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (79).
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (74), next is Agent 3 (37).
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (98).
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (93).
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (78), next is Agent 0 (76).

After resolving potential conflicts and ensuring fairness, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0]
- Agent 1: Items [1]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 3: Items [3]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the valuation is maximized given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
