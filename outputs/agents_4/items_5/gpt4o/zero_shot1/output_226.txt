Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  29  91  97  21
1  71  18  57  90   8
2  58  67   6  27  10
3  51  82  55  58  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy algorithm that focuses on assigning the items to the agent who values them the most. This approach aims to maximize overall satisfaction by ensuring that each item goes to the agent who values it most highly. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Create a list of all items with their respective valuations by each agent.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on the valuations.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
4. Each item can only be allocated once, and each agent must be listed in the final allocation, even if they receive no items.

Let's go through the process:

### Step 1: List of valuations
- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 92, Agent 1 at 71, Agent 2 at 58, Agent 3 at 51.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 29, Agent 1 at 18, Agent 2 at 67, Agent 3 at 82.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 91, Agent 1 at 57, Agent 2 at 6, Agent 3 at 55.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 97, Agent 1 at 90, Agent 2 at 27, Agent 3 at 58.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 21, Agent 1 at 8, Agent 2 at 10, Agent 3 at 25.

### Step 2: Sort items by highest valuation
- Item 3 to Agent 0: 97
- Item 0 to Agent 0: 92
- Item 2 to Agent 0: 91
- Item 1 to Agent 3: 82
- Item 3 to Agent 1: 90

### Step 3: Allocate items
1. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 97)
2. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 92)
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 91)
4. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3 (value 82)

Since Agent 0 has already received the maximum number of items they can have (3), we need to allocate the remaining item:

5. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3 (value 25)

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1 gets no items: []
- Agent 2 gets no items: []
- Agent 3 gets items: [1, 4]

### JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items, and the allocation is based on the highest valuations.
