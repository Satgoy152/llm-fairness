Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  56  69  95  41
1  81  61  29  47  18
2  59   2  24   9  76
3  29  33  88  98  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 56 69 95 41]
 [81 61 29 47 18]
 [59  2 24  9 76]
 [29 33 88 98 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given the table with valuations, we can proceed by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations.

Let's analyze the table and decide the allocations:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest value is for item 3 (95)
   
2. Agent 1:
   - Highest value is for item 0 (81)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest value is for item 4 (76)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest value is for item 3 (98), but since agent 0 already takes item 3, assign the next highest available item, item 2 (88)

Now we have assigned items 0, 2, 3, and 4. We still need to assign item 1. Let's assign it to the agent who values it the next highest among the available options:

- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (56), but Agent 0 already has item 3, so check others:
  - Agent 1 values item 1 at 61, which is higher than Agent 3's value of 33 for the same item.

Therefore, item 1 will go to Agent 1.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 2

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
