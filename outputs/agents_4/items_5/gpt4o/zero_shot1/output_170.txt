Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  88  59  58   1
1  27  10  69  28  45
2  14  37  82  98  27
3  22   0  84  60  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will attempt to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We need to ensure that all items are distributed, and no agent is left out of the allocation.

Let's analyze potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 1 (88).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (69).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 3 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 2 (84), but item 2 is already taken by Agent 1. The next highest is item 3 (60), but item 3 is taken by Agent 2. The next is item 4 (28).

We need to ensure no item is allocated more than once, and each agent should ideally get their highest valued available item.

After ensuring no conflicts and maximizing each agent's valuation, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 1
- Agent 1 gets item 2
- Agent 2 gets item 3
- Agent 3 gets item 0
- Agent 3 also gets item 4 (as it is the next best option for Agent 3)

This allocation ensures that:
- All items are allocated.
- Each agent gets items based on their highest available valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
