Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  20  80  96  79
1  50  74   2   6  55
2  12  59   1  85  50
3  28   6  94  45  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while considering the valuations to maximize fairness. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 50, the highest.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 74, the highest.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it at 94, the highest.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 96, the highest.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it at 83, the highest.

Now, let's ensure a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets no items.
- Agent 3 gets items 2 and 4.

This allocation ensures that we respect the highest valuations while distributing the items fairly.

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
