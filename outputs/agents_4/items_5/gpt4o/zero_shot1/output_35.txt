Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  60  18  11  80
1  36  65  26  69  93
2  98  86  48  71  29
3   6  80  11  38   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 6 80 11 38  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for the agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. One way to approach this is by using a greedy algorithm or solving the problem as an assignment problem using methods like the Hungarian algorithm. However, given the constraints (only 5 items and 4 agents), a manual inspection is feasible.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1.

Now, item 2 remains unallocated. We will allocate it to the agent with the next highest valuation for it, which is Agent 2.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
