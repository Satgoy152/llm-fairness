Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  70  66  19  87
1  42   8  43   6  23
2  11  26  84  77  44
3  66  11  70  13  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[38 70 66 19 87]
 [42  8 43  6 23]
 [11 26 84 77 44]
 [66 11 70 13 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider an approach that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided. One common method is to use a "round-robin" or "greedy" approach to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest-value item for each agent.
2. Allocate items starting from the highest individual valuation until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation based on the table:

```
Agent 0: Values are [38, 70, 66, 19, 87] - Highest value is 87 for item 4.
Agent 1: Values are [42, 8, 43, 6, 23] - Highest value is 43 for item 2.
Agent 2: Values are [11, 26, 84, 77, 44] - Highest value is 84 for item 2.
Agent 3: Values are [66, 11, 70, 13, 28] - Highest value is 70 for item 2.
```

Now, let's allocate:

- Item 4 goes to Agent 0 (highest value 87).
- Item 2 goes to Agent 1 (highest value among remaining options for Agent 1).
- Item 3 goes to Agent 2 (next highest value 77 for agent 2).
- Item 0 goes to Agent 3 (next highest value 66 for agent 3).
- Item 1 goes to Agent 0 (next highest value 70 for agent 0).

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that considers the highest individual valuations and fairly distributes the items.
