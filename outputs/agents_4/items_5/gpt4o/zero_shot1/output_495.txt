Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41   3  90   2  47
1  77   6  85  81  74
2  61  39  72  98  58
3  63   2  69  97  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41  3 90  2 47]
 [77  6 85 81 74]
 [61 39 72 98 58]
 [63  2 69 97 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. This problem resembles a variation of the assignment problem, where we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (90)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (85), but already chosen for Agent 0
   - Next highest: Item 3 (81)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (98), but already chosen for Agent 1
   - Next highest: Item 2 (72), but already chosen for Agent 0
   - Next highest: Item 4 (58)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (97), but already chosen for Agent 1
   - Next highest: Item 0 (63)

Based on these valuations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 0

Now, let's allocate the remaining item:

5. **Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (41) - already chosen for Agent 3
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (74) - already chosen for Agent 2
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (39)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (2)

The unallocated item 1 will go to Agent 2, as it maximizes their satisfaction without exceeding the total of 5 items. 

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [0]
}
```
