Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15   5  40  59  63
1  95  24  20  95  16
2  11  39  13  67  19
3  86  53  90   5  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 53 90  5 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can use a simple heuristic approach here, such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  15   5  40  59  63
1  95  24  20  95  16
2  11  39  13  67  19
3  86  53  90   5  15
```

A possible allocation approach:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Adjust any allocation conflicts by finding the best overall distribution.

Let's begin:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most with 95.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most with 53.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most with 90.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with 59.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most with 63.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives no items.
- Agent 3 receives items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures all items are assigned fairly based on the highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
