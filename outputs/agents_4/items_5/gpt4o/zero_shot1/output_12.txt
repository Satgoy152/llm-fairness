Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  77  68  87  43
1   8  36  35  72   3
2  19  87  23  82  66
3  57  32  65  79  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 77 68 87 43]
 [ 8 36 35 72  3]
 [19 87 23 82 66]
 [57 32 65 79 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value of items assigned to each agent or ensuring that each agent receives at least one item with a high personal valuation. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm or an optimization method like the Hungarian algorithm to maximize total value or fairness.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  77  68  87  43
1   8  36  35  72   3
2  19  87  23  82  66
3  57  32  65  79  82
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (92), we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 highly (72), we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly (87), we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly (82), we allocate item 4 to agent 3.
5. For the remaining item 2, agent 0 values it decently (68), and it fits well with the highest remaining value, so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
