Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  94  92  48  48
1   7  14  33  91  75
2  88  96  83  29  61
3  59  23   6   6  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction. One strategy is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 2: 92
  - Item 3: 48
  - Item 4: 48

- Agent 1 values items:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 91
  - Item 4: 75

- Agent 2 values items:
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 96
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 29
  - Item 4: 61

- Agent 3 values items:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 23
  - Item 2: 6
  - Item 3: 6
  - Item 4: 90

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Item 1 has its highest valuation by Agent 2 (96), so allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
2. Item 3 has its highest valuation by Agent 1 (91), so allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Item 2 has its highest valuation by Agent 0 (92), so allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Item 4 has its highest valuation by Agent 3 (90), so allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.
5. Item 0 has its highest valuation by Agent 2 (88), but since Agent 2 already has Item 1, we look at the next highest, which is Agent 0 (48). Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

Now, each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0 has Items 2 and 0.
- Agent 1 has Item 3.
- Agent 2 has Item 1.
- Agent 3 has Item 4.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
