Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  90  71   3  93
1  25  36  14  24  46
2  69   3  72  47  74
3   3  94  54  60  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 3 94 54 60 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations, we need to ensure that the total value each agent receives is as equitable as possible. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. First, identify the highest value item for each agent and attempt to allocate it accordingly.
2. Ensure that each item is only allocated to one agent.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 93.
- Agent 1 values item 4 at 46, but we already allocated it to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 4 at 74, but we already allocated it to Agent 0.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 94.

Now, let's reallocate to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, which is their highest remaining value at 72.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, which is not their highest but still ensures they receive an item.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, which they value reasonably.

Now, each agent has received an item. Let's see the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to balance the total valuation they receive.
