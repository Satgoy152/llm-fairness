Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  43  51  14  39
1  73  88  30  65  17
2  33  63  46  28   1
3  65  81  65  89  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One way to approach this is by considering the preferences and attempting to equalize the total value each agent receives as much as possible.

Let's evaluate the situation and make a fair allocation:

1. Identify the highest value each agent places on any item.
2. Try to allocate items so that each agent gets at least one of their top-valued items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (51).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (88).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (63) but it can go to Agent 1, so we give them item 0 (33).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most (92).

Let's assign these items and see if we can fairly distribute the remaining items:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

One item remains (item 3). Let's evaluate which agent receives the least value and allocate item 3 to that agent to balance the allocation:

- Agent 0 has item 2 (51).
- Agent 1 has item 1 (88).
- Agent 2 has item 0 (33).
- Agent 3 has item 4 (92).

The remaining item, item 3 (valued at 14 for Agent 0, 65 for Agent 1, 28 for Agent 2, and 89 for Agent 3), should ideally go to Agent 2 to improve their total value as they currently have the least value. 

Thus, item 3 is given to Agent 2.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
