Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  69  25  58  41
1  43  81   8  21  45
2  51  17  63  74  42
3  90  53  22  47  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and that only 5 items are allocated in total.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:** Look for the highest value each agent has for any item and try to allocate based on maximizing individual agent happiness.

2. **Avoid Duplication:** Ensure that no item is allocated to more than one agent.

3. **Fair Distribution:** Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, based on their valuations.

4. **Iterate:** Allocate the highest valued items first, iterating through the list to balance the allocation.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 the most at 69.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 second highest at 81, but since item 1 is already allocated, we look at their next highest value, which is item 4 at 45.
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the most at 74.
- **Agent 3** values item 0 the most at 90.

This leaves us with:

- Item 2 unallocated.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (69)
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (45)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (74)
- **Agent 3**: Item 0 (90)

Since Agent 0 also has a relatively high valuation for item 2 at 25 compared to the lower values from others, we assign item 2 to Agent 0 as well.

Now the allocation is complete:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all 5 items are allocated.
