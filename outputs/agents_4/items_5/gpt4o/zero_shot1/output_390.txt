Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  36  88  69   4
1  17   2  38  50  41
2  94  77  94   1  40
3  55  81  67  12  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items and aim to maximize the overall fairness and satisfaction. One common approach to ensure fairness is the "envy-free" allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. However, given the constraint of assigning exactly 5 items to 4 agents, we will aim to distribute items in a balanced way while considering each agent's valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign the highest valued item according to their preference list. Agent 0 values item 2 (88) the most.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign the highest valued item according to their preference list. Agent 1 values item 4 (41) the most.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign the highest valued item according to their preference list. Agent 2 values item 0 and item 2 (94) equally, but since item 2 is already allocated, assign item 0 (94).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign the highest valued item according to their preference list. Agent 3 values item 1 (81) the most.

Now, there is one item left to allocate:
- Item 3 has not been allocated yet. The highest valuation left for this item is by Agent 1 (50), but Agent 1 already has an item, so we can allocate this item to Agent 0, as it gives them a reasonable value (69).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item, with the total number of items allocated being 5.
