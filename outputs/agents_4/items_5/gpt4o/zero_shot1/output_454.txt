Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  50   0  26  37
1  82   4  47  88  60
2  14  43  49   7  38
3  57  29  51  83  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [57 29 51 83 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing the total value. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (89)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (50)
  
2. **Agent 1's Valuation**:
   - Highest value: Item 3 (88)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (82)

3. **Agent 2's Valuation**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (49)
   - Next highest: Item 4 (38)
  
4. **Agent 3's Valuation**:
   - Highest value: Item 4 (90)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (83)

Now, let's try to assign the items to maximize the total value:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (Value: 89)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (Value: 50)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (Value: 88)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (Value: 49)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 (Value: 90)

This allocation gives each agent one item and fairly distributes the items based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This results in a fair allocation where the total value is maximized based on the agents' preferences.
