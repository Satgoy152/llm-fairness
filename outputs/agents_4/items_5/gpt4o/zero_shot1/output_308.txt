Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  13  14  36  54
1  75  40  11  16  63
2  67  77  23  37  43
3  93  67   2  24  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations given in the table and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, with all 5 items allocated in total. A common method is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring fairness, which often involves giving each agent at least one item if possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 0 (value 59).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 0 (value 75), but since item 0 is already taken, the next highest is item 4 (value 63).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 1 (value 77).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 0 (value 93), but since it's taken, the next highest is item 4 (value 80), but it's taken. The next is item 1 (value 67), but it's also taken. Next is item 3 (value 24).

Now let's allocate the items to maximize the total value:

- **Agent 0** gets item 0.
- **Agent 1** gets item 4.
- **Agent 2** gets item 1.
- **Agent 3** gets item 3.
- Now, item 2 is left, and since no agent has claimed it yet, we assign it to the agent with the highest value for that item which is agent 0.

This allocation ensures every item is distributed and somewhat maximizes valuations for each agent.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 5 items and respects the agents' preferences as much as possible within the constraints.
