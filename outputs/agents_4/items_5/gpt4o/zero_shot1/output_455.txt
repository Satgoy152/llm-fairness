Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  66  84  14  96
1  91  20  98  27  54
2  47  14  57  61  18
3  35  78   2  82  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll try to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and we will aim for a distribution that maximizes the overall valuation sum.

Let's consider the following approach:
1. First, identify the highest value for each agent and allocate that item to the respective agent.
2. Resolve any conflicts where the same item is the highest value for multiple agents by choosing the allocation that maximizes the overall satisfaction.
3. Allocate any remaining items to the agents who have not yet received an item or to those with the best valuation for those items.

Letâ€™s allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 highly (96), so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 highly (98), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly (61), so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highly (82), but it's already taken. The next highest value for agent 3 is item 1 with a value of 78, so allocate item 1 to agent 3.

Finally, we have item 0 left unallocated. Let's assign it to the agent who values it the most and has not yet received an item:
- Agent 0 values item 0 at 70, and agent 0 has already received an item.
- Agent 2 values item 0 at 47, and agent 2 has already received an item.
- Agent 3 values item 0 at 35, and agent 3 has already received an item.

Since all agents have received an item, we will allocate item 0 to the agent who has the next highest unallocated value for it. Thus, we assign item 0 to agent 0.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
