Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  66  62  83   0
1  68  58   6  19  70
2  39  83  11  16  51
3  73  91  68  53  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44 66 62 83  0]
 [68 58  6 19 70]
 [39 83 11 16 51]
 [73 91 68 53 94]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of allocated items is exactly 5.

We can achieve this by following a simple heuristic to maximize the total valuation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent can receive at most one item initially.
2. Reassign items if necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's start by analyzing each item's valuation and allocate them to the agent with the highest valuation:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (68).
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (91).
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (62).
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (83).
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (94).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 has item 0.
- Agent 3 has items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 has no items.

This allocation respects the condition that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
