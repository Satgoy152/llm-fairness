Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  99  46  20  86
1  32  76  69  78  75
2  34  67  72  55  21
3  79  31   4  73   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[34 99 46 20 86]
 [32 76 69 78 75]
 [34 67 72 55 21]
 [79 31  4 73  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent. This can be achieved through a greedy algorithm or by solving the problem using a method like the Hungarian algorithm, which can provide an optimal assignment for maximizing the overall valuation.

Here's a reasonable allocation based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 1 (value = 99)
   - Item 4 (value = 86)

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 3 (value = 78)

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 2 (value = 72)

4. Agent 3:
   - Item 0 (value = 79)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of the items with the highest value they have for any item, and all items are allocated. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent gets an integer number of items.
