Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  82   4  96   5
1  66  85   9   3  97
2  59   0  30  81  58
3  52  29  60  62  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59  0 30 81 58]
 [52 29 60 62 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the following approach:

1. Each item should be allocated to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by agent 0 (23).
- Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 1 (85).
- Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 3 (60).
- Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 0 (96).
- Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 1 (97).

Based on these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives no items.

Now, putting this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated based on the highest valuation and each agent gets an integer number of items.
