Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  46  55  98  14
1  39  67  66  38  21
2   3  44   8  13  98
3  81  54  77  69  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will try to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible, considering the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step method to achieve this:

1. **Start with high-value items**: Allocate items to agents based on who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

2. **Allocate Items**:
   - Item 0: Highest value is for Agent 0 (91). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Highest value is for Agent 1 (67). Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Highest value is for Agent 3 (77). Allocate to Agent 3.
   - Item 3: Highest value is for Agent 0 (98). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Highest value is for Agent 2 (98). Allocate to Agent 2.

3. **Check allocation**: Each item has been allocated. Each agent has at least one item, except Agent 3, whom we will ensure gets an item.

4. **Final Allocation**: Ensure no agent is left out if possible while respecting the total item limit.

The final allocation, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 5, is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value the most, and each other agent receives at least one item, maintaining fairness and maximizing the valuation satisfaction.
