Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  63  90  81  32
1   4  22  56  27  58
2  23  37  96  76  76
3  55  33  52  70  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 37 96 76 76]
 [55 33 52 70 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider their valuations for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [33, 63, 90, 81, 32]
- Agent 1 values: [4, 22, 56, 27, 58]
- Agent 2 values: [23, 37, 96, 76, 76]
- Agent 3 values: [55, 33, 52, 70, 44]

A common method of fair allocation is to use the "maximum valuation" approach, where we try to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's apply this method:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (55).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (63).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (96).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (81).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (76).

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4
- Agent 3: Item 0

This ensures that each item is allocated and all agents are accounted for, even if some receive no items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

These allocations ensure each agent receives the items they value the most, leading to a fair distribution based on their preferences.
