Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  96  90  10  22
1  84  83  99  49   4
2  36  91  95  14  56
3  14  81  75  21  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 96 90 10 22]
 [84 83 99 49  4]
 [36 91 95 14 56]
 [14 81 75 21 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents by assigning items to the agents that value them the most. Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. List and sort each item by the agent that values it the most.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the table for optimal allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 81.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 49.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 56.

Following this logic, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": []
}
```
