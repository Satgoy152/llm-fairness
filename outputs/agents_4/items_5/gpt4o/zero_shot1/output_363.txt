Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  10  45  29   3
1  29  43  76  78   8
2  30  95  54  59  73
3  93  14  64  68  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 10 45 29  3]
 [29 43 76 78  8]
 [30 95 54 59 73]
 [93 14 64 68 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. However, given that there are more agents than items, some agents may not receive any items.

Let's consider the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [6, 10, 45, 29, 3]
   - Highest value: 45 for item 2

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [29, 43, 76, 78, 8]
   - Highest value: 78 for item 3

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [30, 95, 54, 59, 73]
   - Highest value: 95 for item 1

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [93, 14, 64, 68, 40]
   - Highest value: 93 for item 0

Now, we allocate the items based on the highest value each agent places on an item, making sure not to double-assign any item:

- Agent 0 gets item 2
- Agent 1 gets item 3
- Agent 2 gets item 1
- Agent 3 gets item 0

After assigning these items, we have one item left to allocate, which is item 4. We check which agent can benefit the most from this item:

- Agent 0 values item 4 at 3
- Agent 1 values item 4 at 8
- Agent 2 values item 4 at 73
- Agent 3 values item 4 at 40

Agent 2 values item 4 the highest, so item 4 is allocated to Agent 2.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
