Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  45  36  28   3
1  48  89  66   0  55
2  82  75  46  80  87
3  50  66  83  64  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [48 89 66  0 55]
 [82 75 46 80 87]
 [50 66 83 64 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value they place on items. A common method to achieve fairness is to maximize the total valuation of the allocated items for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. First, let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

   - Agent 0: 61 + 45 + 36 + 28 + 3 = 173
   - Agent 1: 48 + 89 + 66 + 0 + 55 = 258
   - Agent 2: 82 + 75 + 46 + 80 + 87 = 370
   - Agent 3: 50 + 66 + 83 + 64 + 46 = 309

2. Next, we can try to allocate items by focusing on each agent's highest valued items, while ensuring no items are allocated more than once.

3. By checking each agent's highest valued items, we can try the following allocation:

   - Agent 0: Item 0 (Value: 61)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (Value: 89)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (Value: 87)
   - Agent 3: Item 2 (Value: 83)
   - We still need to allocate 1 more item, so let's allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 (Value: 80) because it maximizes the remaining value.

This allocation maximizes the total value fairly among the agents. All items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
