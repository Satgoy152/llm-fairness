Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  12  73  30  96
1  38   3  76  95  12
2  22  70  62  86  45
3  43  66  48   0  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Here's one approach:

1. **List the Valuations**: Write down the valuations for each agent for all items.

2. **Allocate Items**: Start by assigning items to agents based on the highest value given by any agent for an item. This can be done by iterating over the items and finding which agent values the item the most, then allocating the item to that agent. 

3. **Avoid Conflicts**: If two agents have the same highest valuation for the same item, choose based on the next highest valuation for a remaining item, or resolve it based on overall fairness.

Let's go through this process:

- **Item 0**: Valuations are [77, 38, 22, 43]. Agent 0 values it the highest. Allocate to agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Valuations are [12, 3, 70, 66]. Agent 2 values it the highest. Allocate to agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Valuations are [73, 76, 62, 48]. Agent 1 values it the highest. Allocate to agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Valuations are [30, 95, 86, 0]. Agent 1 values it the highest. Allocate to agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Valuations are [96, 12, 45, 45]. Agent 0 values it the highest. Allocate to agent 0.

After allocations:

- Agent 0 has items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 has items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 has item 1.
- Agent 3 has no items.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": []
}
```
