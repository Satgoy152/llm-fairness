Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  78  36  42   6
1  84  85  67   6  92
2   0  45  44  13  12
3  35   3  26   2  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 85 67  6 92]
 [ 0 45 44 13 12]
 [35  3 26  2 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and no more than the total number of items available. We need to distribute 5 items among 4 agents, which means one agent will receive 2 items while others receive 1 item each.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 1 (78)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 4 (92)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 1 (45), but it is already taken, so next is item 2 (44)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 4 (84), but it is already taken, so next is item 0 (35)

Now we have these allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0

We have one item left to allocate, item 3.

- Agent 0: Value for item 3 is 42
- Agent 1: Value for item 3 is 6
- Agent 2: Value for item 3 is 13
- Agent 3: Value for item 3 is 2

Agent 0 has the highest value for item 3, so we assign it to Agent 0.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
