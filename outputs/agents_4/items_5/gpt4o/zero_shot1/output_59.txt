Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  39  35  65  94
1  21  17  86  36  41
2  42  83  13  51  68
3   8  19  59  68  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed, we can use a method like maximizing the total valuation or ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's consider a simple approach to achieve this allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Using this method, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Valuations are 65, 21, 42, 8. The highest is 65 by Agent 0.
- Item 1: Valuations are 39, 17, 83, 19. The highest is 83 by Agent 2.
- Item 2: Valuations are 35, 86, 13, 59. The highest is 86 by Agent 1.
- Item 3: Valuations are 65, 36, 51, 68. The highest is 68 by Agent 3.
- Item 4: Valuations are 94, 41, 68, 72. The highest is 94 by Agent 0.

So, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
