Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  74  26  13  63
1  51  82  86  54   0
2  94  27  96  46  38
3  95  40  20   7  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [95 40 20  7 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for each item. One common approach is to maximize the total valuation by assigning items to agents who value them the most. However, we should also strive for fairness by ensuring each agent gets an opportunity, if possible.

Letâ€™s consider a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly (74), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (86), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 highly (94), so assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the most (7), but the next highest valuation is item 4 (46), so assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. The remaining item, item 3, can be assigned to agent 1, who values it relatively well (54).

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

Here, each agent has received items based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are fairly allocated.
