Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  93  28  92  79
1  91  61  87  37  76
2  83  97  27  14   9
3  70  17  87  64   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (where possible) and all items are distributed. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is for item 1 (93).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is for item 0 (91).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is for item 1 (97). However, item 1 is already taken.
   - Next highest value is for item 0 (83), but it is taken. 
   - The next highest available is item 2 (27).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value for Agent 3 is for item 2 (87), but it is taken.
   - Next highest value is for item 3 (64).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - Only item 4 remains unallocated.
   - Agent 0 has the highest remaining value for item 4 (79).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
