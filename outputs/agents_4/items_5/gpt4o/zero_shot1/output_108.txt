Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  16  85  16  98
1  24  10   3  89   7
2  88   0  29  78  54
3  77  83  79  26  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. One common approach is to use an envy-free allocation method, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the highest valued item for each agent and attempt to allocate accordingly while making sure each item is assigned only once.

1. **Agent 0**:
    - Values: [52, 16, 85, 16, 98]
    - Highest value: Item 4 (value = 98)

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Values: [24, 10, 3, 89, 7]
    - Highest value: Item 3 (value = 89)

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Values: [88, 0, 29, 78, 54]
    - Highest value: Item 0 (value = 88)

4. **Agent 3**:
    - Values: [77, 83, 79, 26, 66]
    - Highest value: Item 1 (value = 83)

Now allocate the remaining item:

- Item 2 is left unallocated. The next highest preference for Item 2 is:
  - Agent 3: Value = 79

Thus, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 1 and 2

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
