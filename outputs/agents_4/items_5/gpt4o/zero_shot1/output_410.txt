Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  86  17  59  31
1  74  77  25  94  40
2   0  60  98  10  34
3  23  67  93  27  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We'll consider the highest valuations each agent has for the items and distribute accordingly, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one way to approach this:

1. Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 1 (86).
2. Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 3 (94).
3. Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 2 (98).
4. Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 2 (93), but since it's already allocated, we consider the next highest, which is item 1 (67), but it's also taken. Then, item 4 (46).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item:

- Item 0 is left unallocated and has the highest valuation with Agent 1 (74).

Allocating based on the highest unallocated value:

- Agent 1 receives item 0 for additional allocation.

The allocations will be:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.
