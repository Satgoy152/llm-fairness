Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  70  78  50  86
1  64  99  76  83  85
2   3  45  70  43  93
3   5  60  20  10  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 99 76 83 85]
 [ 3 45 70 43 93]
 [ 5 60 20 10 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 5 items are allocated. One possible approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets the items they value most while also achieving a fair distribution.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, who values it at 65.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, who values it at 99.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0, who values it at 78.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1, who values it at 83.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2, who values it at 93.

This allocation aims to maximize overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each item is allocated once.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": []
}
```
