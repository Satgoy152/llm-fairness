Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  72  14  68  55
1  26  92  93  30  77
2  64  51  17  36  82
3  93  68  57  16  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [64 51 17 36 82]
 [93 68 57 16 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (since there are 5 items and 4 agents). One common approach is to use a method similar to the Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems, which seeks to maximize the total valuation.

Here's a possible allocation strategy based on maximizing the individual valuations:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (72)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (93)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (82)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (93)

Now, allocate the remaining item:

- Item 3 can be allocated to Agent 0, who has the next highest value for it (68).

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.
