Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  51  17  48  17
1  31  52   9  44  71
2  71  19  76  73  49
3  23  12  20  42  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 52  9 44 71]
 [71 19 76 73 49]
 [23 12 20 42 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that assigns items to the agents who value them the most. We'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their assigned items. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [77, 51, 17, 48, 17]
   - Highest value is 77 for item 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [31, 52, 9, 44, 71]
   - Highest value is 71 for item 4.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [71, 19, 76, 73, 49]
   - Highest value is 76 for item 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [23, 12, 20, 42, 53]
   - Highest value is 53 for item 4.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 77).
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 71).
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 76).
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (value 42).

At this point, all agents have at least one item except Agent 3. However, item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1, so we can't assign it to Agent 3. 

Let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, and every agent receives at least one item.
