Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89   6  46  20  76
1  58  43  49  16  53
2   3   5  51  67  64
3   2  99  24  85   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 2 99 24 85  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction or ensure a fair distribution that considers the preferences expressed in the table. One common approach is to use a method that maximizes total valuation or ensures each agent has at least one of their more valued items, if possible.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (89), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (49), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (67), so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most (99), so allocate item 1 to agent 3.
5. The remaining item is 4. Agent 0 values it second highest (76), so allocate item 4 to agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one of their more highly valued items, and all items are distributed.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
