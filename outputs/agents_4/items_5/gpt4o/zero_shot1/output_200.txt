Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  54  32  78  38
1  79  78  14  21  60
2  34  61  40  56  20
3  97   7  79  58  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and every item is assigned to only one agent. This problem can be approached as a variation of the assignment problem, which can be solved using various methods including the Hungarian algorithm, heuristic approaches, or manual inspection due to the small size of the problem.

Considering the table provided:

```
Valuations Table:
  0   1   2   3   4
0 19  54  32  78  38
1 79  78  14  21  60
2 34  61  40  56  20
3 97   7  79  58  92
```

Let's manually inspect and allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction and ensure a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 3 (value 78).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 0 (value 79).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 1 (value 61).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 4 (value 92).

Now we have allocated four items. We need to allocate one more item:

- For item 2, the values are: Agent 0: 32, Agent 1: 14, Agent 2: 40, Agent 3: 79. The highest value is with Agent 3.

Considering this, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets items 4 and 2.

The allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```
