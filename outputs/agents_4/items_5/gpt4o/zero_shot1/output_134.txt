Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  67   7  40  20
1  85  63  44  33  93
2  28  14  88  46  58
3  77  53  69  67  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and aim to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the agents and their valuations, one approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here are the steps for allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 85.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 67.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 88.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most at 67.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most at 96.

The allocations result in the following fair distribution:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 4.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, while complying with the requirement that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated.
