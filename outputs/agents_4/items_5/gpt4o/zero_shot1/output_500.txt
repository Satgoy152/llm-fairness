Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  35  96  56  22
1  35  30  54  73  83
2   1  81  31  53  22
3  75   5  23  27   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44 35 96 56 22]
 [35 30 54 73 83]
 [ 1 81 31 53 22]
 [75  5 23 27  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents, we will use a simple algorithm that aims to maximize the total happiness by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach won't guarantee a perfectly fair allocation but will ensure that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the highest.

Let's go through the valuation table and allocate each item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 75.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 81.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 96.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 73.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 83.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is given to the agent who values it the most. Agent 1 receives two items because they have the highest valuations for both items 3 and 4. All other agents receive one item each.
