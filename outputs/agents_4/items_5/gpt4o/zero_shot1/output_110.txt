Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  79   8  13  62
1  79  49  92   1  23
2  87  83  99  28   9
3  24  67  31  76   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[14 79  8 13 62]
 [79 49 92  1 23]
 [87 83 99 28  9]
 [24 67 31 76  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. We will attempt to assign items such that the sum of the valuations for each agent's assigned items is as large as possible. 

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [14, 79,  8, 13, 62]
Agent 1: [79, 49, 92,  1, 23]
Agent 2: [87, 83, 99, 28,  9]
Agent 3: [24, 67, 31, 76,  1]
```

Our goal is to allocate the 5 items to the 4 agents. We can start by identifying which items have the highest individual value for any agent, and then allocate those items to maximize the total valuation across all agents. 

1. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 2 with a value of 99. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
2. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2 with a value of 87. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
3. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 3 with a value of 76. Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
4. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0 with a value of 79. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
5. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 0 with a value of 62. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

Now, let's ensure every agent is included in the allocation even if they receive no items:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation and ensures each agent's allocation is considered.
