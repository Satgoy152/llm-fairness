Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  68  68  33  24
1  43  17  83  97  29
2   1  86  53  92  55
3  32  16  82  95  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[22 68 68 33 24]
 [43 17 83 97 29]
 [ 1 86 53 92 55]
 [32 16 82 95 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation or tries to balance the valuations each agent receives. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has relatively lower valuations across items, so we will allocate items with moderate value for them.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuation for item 3, so we will prioritize this allocation.
3. **Agent 2**: Has highest value for item 1, and moderate value for item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high value for item 3 and 4, but since item 3 is already taken, they will get item 4.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 22)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 97)
- **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 86)
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (value 69)

This leaves item 2 unallocated, which we can assign to the agent with the next highest valuation for it, which is Agent 0 (value 68).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest preferences, and all items are allocated.
