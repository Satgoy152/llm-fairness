Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  91  38  36   4
1   1  59  37  77   7
2  54  59  35  75  58
3  80   0  69  50  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 59 37 77  7]
 [54 59 35 75 58]
 [80  0 69 50 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 4 agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their individual preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Value is highest for item 1 (91).
- Agent 1: Value is highest for item 3 (77).
- Agent 2: Value is highest for item 0 (54).
- Agent 3: Value is highest for item 4 (97).

Each of these agents receives one item, and one item remains: item 2. We can allocate item 2 to the agent with the next highest preference for it, which is agent 3 with a value of 69.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items according to their valuations as much as possible.
