Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  70  31   4  90
1  83  26  54  25  98
2  38  11  80  91  67
3  40  24  76  30  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 26 54 25 98]
 [38 11 80 91 67]
 [40 24 76 30 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value across all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [62, 70, 31, 4, 90]
   - The highest value is 90 for item 4.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [83, 26, 54, 25, 98]
   - The highest value is 98 for item 4, but item 4 is already considered for Agent 0. The next highest is 83 for item 0.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [38, 11, 80, 91, 67]
   - The highest value is 91 for item 3.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [40, 24, 76, 30, 51]
   - The highest value is 76 for item 2.

Allocating items based on the highest value for each agent, considering no conflicts:

- Agent 0 gets item 4
- Agent 1 gets item 0
- Agent 2 gets item 3
- Agent 3 gets item 2

This leaves item 1 unallocated. Now we need to allocate it to one of the agents:

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 70
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 26
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 11
- Agent 3 values item 1 at 24

Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 70, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total value across all agents is maximized, and each agent receives at least one item.
