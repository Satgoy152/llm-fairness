Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  50  83  24  26
1  66  47  78  97  37
2  19  33  62  25  87
3  46  70  70  95  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the overall valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that each agent maximizes their individual value, while also being fair in distribution. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by considering the highest valued items for each agent and allocate them one by one.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and then allocate remaining items to maximize overall valuation.

Let's go through the potential allocations:

- Agent 0: Values items as 43, 50, 83, 24, 26. Highest valuation is for item 2 (83 points).
- Agent 1: Values items as 66, 47, 78, 97, 37. Highest valuation is for item 3 (97 points).
- Agent 2: Values items as 19, 33, 62, 25, 87. Highest valuation is for item 4 (87 points).
- Agent 3: Values items as 46, 70, 70, 95, 72. Highest valuation is for item 3, but since it's taken, the next highest is item 1 (70 points).

Now, let's assign items based on the highest valuations ensuring no item is allocated more than once:

- Agent 0: Assign item 2.
- Agent 1: Assign item 3.
- Agent 2: Assign item 4.
- Agent 3: Assign item 1.

Now, we have one item left, item 0, which should be assigned to the agent with the highest remaining valuation for it:

- Agent 1 values item 0 at 66, the highest remaining unassigned value for item 0.

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed in a way that maximizes the overall valuation of the agents.
