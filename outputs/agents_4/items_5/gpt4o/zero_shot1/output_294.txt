Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  89  78  59  97
1  80   6  36  24  73
2  86  77  45  90  98
3  80  14  97  80  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One potential allocation strategy is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation for items: 4 (value 97), 1 (value 89)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation for items: 0 (value 80), 4 (value 73)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation for items: 4 (value 98), 3 (value 90)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation for items: 2 (value 97), 0 (value 80)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

This allocation leaves item 1 unallocated:

- **Agent 0** has the second-highest valuation for item 1 (value 89).
- **Agent 2** also has a high valuation for item 1 (value 77).

To ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they have the highest remaining valuation for an unallocated item.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the distribution is based on maximizing each agent's preferences.
