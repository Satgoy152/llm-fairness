Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  64  78  93  11
1  71  37  50  16  97
2   6  69  38   8  59
3   2  79  46  31  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 64 78 93 11]
 [71 37 50 16 97]
 [ 6 69 38  8 59]
 [ 2 79 46 31 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuations while ensuring that each agent can receive a whole number of items. We will consider the valuations and try to distribute the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction as evenly as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [11, 64, 78, 93, 11]
- Agent 1: [71, 37, 50, 16, 97]
- Agent 2: [6, 69, 38, 8, 59]
- Agent 3: [2, 79, 46, 31, 35]

One way to approach this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 71 by Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 79 by Agent 3.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 78 by Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 93 by Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 97 by Agent 1.

However, this allocation would give Agent 1 three items and Agent 0 two items, while Agent 2 and Agent 3 would receive none. We need to adjust to ensure a more balanced distribution.

Revised allocation:
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

This way, every agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is more balanced.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
