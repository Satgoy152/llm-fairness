Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  91   7  95  45
1  23  85   3  49  56
2   2  10  47  32  65
3  23  15   2  82  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 10 47 32 65]
 [23 15  2 82 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will utilize a simple allocation method by considering each agent's valuations for the items and ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We will try to maximize the total valuation by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 66. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 91. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the most at 47. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 95. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values item 4 the most at 95. Assign item 4 to agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives an integer number of items, and we have fairly assigned the items based on the given valuations.
