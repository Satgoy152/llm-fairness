Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57   0   7  53  59
1   2  20  58  77  82
2  52   7  70   2  84
3  95  55  10  79  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will try to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's consider the following strategy for allocation:  
1. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives an item.
2. Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure all items are allocated and to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's analyze the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 57     | 0      | 7      | 53     | 59     |
| 1     | 2      | 20     | 58     | 77     | 82     |
| 2     | 52     | 7      | 70     | 2      | 84     |
| 3     | 95     | 55     | 10     | 79     | 26     |

- For **Item 0**, Agent 3 values it the most (95).
- For **Item 1**, Agent 3 values it the most (55).
- For **Item 2**, Agent 2 values it the most (70).
- For **Item 3**, Agent 1 values it the most (77).
- For **Item 4**, Agent 2 values it the most (84).

Initial allocation based on maximum valuations:
- Agent 0: None
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0: 0 items
- Agent 1: 1 item (77)
- Agent 2: 2 items (70 + 84 = 154)
- Agent 3: 2 items (95 + 55 = 150)

Adjusting to ensure each agent gets at least 1 item:
- Move Item 1 from Agent 3 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4
- Agent 3: Item 0

The final JSON allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
