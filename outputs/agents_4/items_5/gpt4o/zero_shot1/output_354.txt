Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  67  43  82  95
1  58  65  64  66  66
2  16  69   6  80  22
3   4  39  99  72  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [16 69  6 80 22]
 [ 4 39 99 72 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the table, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Let's go through a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent one by one until all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (95), so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (64), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (80), so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 1 (39), so allocate item 1 to agent 3.
- Now, allocate the remaining item (item 0) to the agent who values it the highest. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (78), but since agent 0 already received item 4, allocate item 0 to the next highest unfulfilled agent, which is agent 1 (58).

This results in:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [2, 0]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
