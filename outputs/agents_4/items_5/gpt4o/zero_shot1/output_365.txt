Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  14  48  59  35
1  65  44  60  53  49
2  75  21  78  60  62
3  13  73  54  16  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 73 54 16 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuation of the items, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [18, 14, 48, 59, 35]
- Agent 1 values: [65, 44, 60, 53, 49]
- Agent 2 values: [75, 21, 78, 60, 62]
- Agent 3 values: [13, 73, 54, 16, 78]

We can use the following strategy to allocate items:
1. Assign each agent an item they value the most and ensure every agent gets one item.
2. Distribute the remaining item(s) based on maximizing total value.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. Agent 0: Their highest valuation is for item 3 (59).
2. Agent 1: Their highest valuation is for item 0 (65).
3. Agent 2: Their highest valuation is for item 2 (78).
4. Agent 3: Their highest valuation is for item 4 (78).

After allocating these items:
- Agent 0 has item 3.
- Agent 1 has item 0.
- Agent 2 has item 2.
- Agent 3 has item 4.

The unallocated item is item 1. Let's allocate it to the agent who values it the most among those who already have items, ensuring fairness:
- Agent 0 values item 1 at 14.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 44.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 21.
- Agent 3 values item 1 at 73.

Agent 3 values item 1 the most after receiving an item, so we assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [4, 1]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```
