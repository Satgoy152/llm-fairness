Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  52  62  56  79
1  24  15  51  90   8
2   6  92   4  39  49
3  38  41  49  76  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) or try to ensure a balanced distribution of high-value items among the agents. Since fairness doesn't have a strict definition in this context, one approach is to maximize the individual satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 79. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 92. Assign item 1 to agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 62. Assign item 2 to agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 90. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 and Agent 3 have the highest valuation at 79 and 62 respectively. To balance the allocations, assign item 4 to agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items based on their highest valuations, with agent 0 getting two items of high personal value, while the others get one item each.
