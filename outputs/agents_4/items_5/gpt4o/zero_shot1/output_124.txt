Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  48  80  98   3
1   3  17   7  41  89
2  61   1  13   8  25
3  41  62  35   9  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 62 35  9 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are allocated without leaving any agent without consideration.

Let's analyze the available valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Values items as follows - [36, 48, 80, 98, 3]
- Agent 1: Values items as follows - [3, 17, 7, 41, 89]
- Agent 2: Values items as follows - [61, 1, 13, 8, 25]
- Agent 3: Values items as follows - [41, 62, 35, 9, 98]

One strategy is to allocate the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

1. Item 0: Most valued by Agent 2 (61)
2. Item 1: Most valued by Agent 3 (62)
3. Item 2: Most valued by Agent 0 (80)
4. Item 3: Most valued by Agent 0 (98)
5. Item 4: Most valued by Agent 1 (89)

Let's ensure every agent gets at least something if possible:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Item [0]
- Agent 3: Item [1]

Now let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```
