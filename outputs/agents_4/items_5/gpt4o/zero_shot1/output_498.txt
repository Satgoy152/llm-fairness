Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  61  36  69  43
1  45  93   8  64  36
2  97  15  54   1  73
3  86  91  14  20  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [86 91 14 20 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We can use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations until all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each item:**

   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 97.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 93.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 36.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 69.
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 73.

2. **Initial allocation based on highest valuations:**

   - Assign item 0 to agent 2.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 2.

3. **Review to ensure fairness:**

   - Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives item 1.
   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.
   - Agent 3 receives no items.

   If we want to ensure every agent receives at least one item, we need to reallocate to give agent 3 an item. We can take an item from an agent who has more than one.

4. **Reallocate to ensure each agent gets at least one item:**

   - Reallocate item 3 from agent 0 to agent 3.

5. **Final allocation:**

   - Agent 0 receives item 2.
   - Agent 1 receives item 1.
   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.
   - Agent 3 receives item 3.

Now we present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
