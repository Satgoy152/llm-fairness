Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  42  78  70  63
1  84  57  68  26  21
2  16  29  44  18  65
3  16  97  61  61  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16 29 44 18 65]
 [16 97 61 61 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all agents get at least one item. 
2. If any agent does not receive an item, swap items between agents to achieve at least one item per agent.

Let's allocate the items based on this strategy:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 97.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 78.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it second highest at 70 (since agent 3 already has item 1).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 65.

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.

Since Agent 1 does not have any items, we can adjust the allocation to ensure all agents receive at least one item:

- Reallocate item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1, who values it higher than Agent 2 and Agent 3.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, with a total of five items allocated.
