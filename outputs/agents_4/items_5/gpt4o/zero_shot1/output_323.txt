Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  21  82  36  58
1  13  39  22  30  42
2  36  92   4  81  26
3  28  37  62  88   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy strategy that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Below is a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 87.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 92.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 82.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the most at 88.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 58.

However, item 4 cannot be assigned to agent 0 again, as that would exceed a fair distribution with agent 0 getting more than one item more than other agents. We need to ensure each agent gets at least one item before repeating an assignment to an agent who already has more than one item.

To achieve this, let's adjust the allocation so that each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 87.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 92.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values item 2 the most at 62.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the most at 88.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 42.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and the allocation is fair.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
