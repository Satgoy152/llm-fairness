Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  47  18  46  12  47   6  16  67
1  49  71  67  89  75  98  98  40  88
2  71   6  49  81  91  38   9   2  36
3  91  17  70  55  84  53  67  78  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Identify highest valuations**: Start by identifying the items with the highest value for each agent.
2. **Initial allocation**: Allocate items to agents starting with their highest valuations, ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.
3. **Balancing remaining items**: Distribute any remaining items among the agents, trying to maintain a balance in overall value received by each agent.

Let's break down the allocation process for this problem:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are items 1 (47), 5 (47), and 3 (46).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are items 5 (98), 6 (98), and 3 (89).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are items 4 (91), 3 (81), and 0 (71).
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are items 0 (91), 4 (84), and 7 (78).

Based on this, we can start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent and adjust as needed:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items 6 and 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items 4 and 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items 0 and 7.

Now we have allocated 8 items. The remaining item (8) can be allocated to Agent 3, who has the highest valuation for it among the unallocated items.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [0, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and aims to balance the high-value allocations among the agents.
