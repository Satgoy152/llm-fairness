Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  86  90  92  80  36  29  35  90
1  59  99  60  39  47  78  87  67  51
2   0  24  62  78  59  11  87  87  59
3  47  27  60  12  40  80  86  96  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction based on each agent's valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. There are 9 items and 4 agents, so we need to consider how to allocate the items fairly while respecting these constraints.

Let's proceed with a strategy where we try to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: 3 (92), 2 (90), 8 (90)
   - Allocate items: 2, 3, 8

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 1 (99), 6 (87), 5 (78)
   - Allocate items: 1, 5, 6

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 6 (87), 7 (87), 3 (78)
   - Allocate items: 7

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 7 (96), 5 (80), 6 (86)
   - Allocate item: 0, 4

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: 2, 3, 8
- Agent 1: 1, 5, 6
- Agent 2: 7
- Agent 3: 0, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent is assigned an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 8],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
