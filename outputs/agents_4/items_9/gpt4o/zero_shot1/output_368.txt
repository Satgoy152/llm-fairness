Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  98  33  78  62  18  24  95  73
1  95  10  19  11  27  50  98  26  37
2  87  84  43  96  51  19  14  94  72
3  47  78  76  72   3  74  72  59  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we can aim to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that Agent 3 values highly.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 1 (value 98)
  - Item 3 (value 78)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 0 (value 95)
  - Item 6 (value 98)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 2 (value 43)
  - Item 7 (value 94)

- **Agent 3**: 
  - Item 5 (value 74)
  - Item 4 (value 3)
  - Item 8 (value 33)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [5, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, striving for a balanced distribution based on their valuations.
