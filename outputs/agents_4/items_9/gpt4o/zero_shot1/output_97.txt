Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11   5  44  95   6  10  69  77  59
1  34  85  24  13  27   3  46  54  61
2  15   5  36   0   4  55  46  18  59
3  84  97  55   7  34  12  32   7  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that the total number of items allocated is 9. Let's try to allocate the items based on the valuation table provided, aiming to maximize the total value each agent receives.

First, let's consider the highest valuations each agent has for any item and allocate those items to the corresponding agents, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

Agent 0:
- Highest value is for item 3 (value = 95)

Agent 1:
- Highest value is for item 1 (value = 85)

Agent 2:
- Highest value is for item 5 (value = 55)

Agent 3:
- Highest value is for item 1 (value = 97), but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 0 (value = 84)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations to balance the allocations:

Agent 0:
- Already has item 3, next highest is item 2 (value = 44)

Agent 1:
- Already has item 1, next highest is item 8 (value = 61)

Agent 2:
- Already has item 5, next highest is item 8 (value = 59), but it's already allocated. Next is item 6 (value = 46)

Agent 3:
- Already has item 0, next highest is item 2 (value = 55), but it's already allocated. Next is item 8 (value = 65), but it's allocated. Next is item 4 (value = 34)

Now, we check if all items are allocated:

Allocated items:
- Agent 0: 3, 2
- Agent 1: 1, 8
- Agent 2: 5, 6
- Agent 3: 0, 4

The remaining items are 7 and 9. We will allocate these to the agents with fewer items or those with lower total valuations:

Agent 0:
- Can take item 7 (value = 77)

Agent 2:
- Can take item 9 (value = 59)

After this allocation, each agent has at least 2 items. 

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
