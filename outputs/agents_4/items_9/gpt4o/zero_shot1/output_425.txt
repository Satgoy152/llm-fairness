Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  20  80  63   2  25   2  79  46
1  95  22  12   0  83  50  68  70  12
2  25  87  15   1  59  39  96  36  85
3  95  32  20  88   3  11  68  61  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items. This is a combinatorial optimization problem, and one simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items according to the highest valuation for each item.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most (95).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most (87).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (80).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most (88).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (83).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (50).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most (96).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most (79).
9. **Item 8**: Agent 3 values it the most (91).

Now, let's check the allocations to ensure they are fair and complete:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 8]

Each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 8]
}
```
