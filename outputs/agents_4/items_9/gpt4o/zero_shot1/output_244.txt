Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81   0  83  82  43  49  30  86  35
1  96  73  25  13   3  75  56  94  52
2  27  11   3  60   4  84  81  14   0
3  91  93  25  16   5  95  99  19  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 9. We will consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [81, 0, 83, 82, 43, 49, 30, 86, 35]
- Agent 1: [96, 73, 25, 13, 3, 75, 56, 94, 52]
- Agent 2: [27, 11, 3, 60, 4, 84, 81, 14, 0]
- Agent 3: [91, 93, 25, 16, 5, 95, 99, 19, 51]

To ensure fairness, we can distribute items such that each agent gets items with reasonable values according to their preferences, ensuring no agent is left without items.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 7]
  - Values: [81, 83, 86]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 8]
  - Values: [73, 52]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 5]
  - Values: [60, 84]
- Agent 3: Items [4, 6]
  - Values: [5, 99]

This allocation considers both the number of items each agent receives and their preferences. Each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
