Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1   7  58   8  13  36  56  73  84
1  47  26  88  75  66  57  54   0  89
2  50  46   7  99  19  28  53   5   7
3  81  32  23  84  15  32  86  44  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a balanced share of the total value. We aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [1, 7, 58, 8, 13, 36, 56, 73, 84]
- Agent 1: [47, 26, 88, 75, 66, 57, 54, 0, 89]
- Agent 2: [50, 46, 7, 99, 19, 28, 53, 5, 7]
- Agent 3: [81, 32, 23, 84, 15, 32, 86, 44, 22]

We will proceed by examining each item and assigning it to the agent who values it the most, while trying to distribute the number of items evenly:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (81).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the least, Agents 2 and 3 have moderate values, and Agent 1 values it the least. Agent 2 gets it.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (88).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (99).
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (66).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (57).
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most (86).
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most (73).
9. Item 8: Agent 1 values it the most (89).

Let's ensure each agent gets a balanced number of items:

- Agent 0: [1, 7]
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 5, 8]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [0, 6]

Now, let's write the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
