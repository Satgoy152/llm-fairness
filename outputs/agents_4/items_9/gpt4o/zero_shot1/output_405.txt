Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9   9   1  72  87  29  91  21  59
1  25  81  27  17  32  63  99  30  25
2  52  64  87  40  17  41  26  51  59
3  96  58  41  31  51  54  58  51  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can apply a method that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One way to approach this problem is to use a greedy algorithm, where we iteratively assign the highest-valued remaining item to the agent for whom it provides the most relative value. This process continues until all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign that item to the agent who values it the most. 
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. If there are any unallocated items after step 1, allocate them to the agent who values them the most among those who haven't exceeded a fair share of items.

Let's implement this approach:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the most (91), assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most (99), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 1 (81), assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most (87), assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (96), assign item 0 to agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining items (3, 4, 5, 7, 8) by maximizing each agent's total valuation:

5. Agent 0 values item 3 (72), assign item 3 to agent 0.
6. Agent 3 values item 8 (93), assign item 8 to agent 3.
7. Agent 1 values item 5 (63), assign item 5 to agent 1.
8. Agent 2 values item 7 (51), assign item 7 to agent 2.
9. The remaining item 4 is valued highest by agent 0 (87), assign item 4 to agent 0.

The item allocation is now complete, with the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [0, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their valuations.
