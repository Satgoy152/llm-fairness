Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  47  29  65  53  71  44  31  71
1  71  14  14  33  18  10  16  33  91
2  57  89  82  94  83  77  68  29  86
3  28  82  25  64  81  79  67   6  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets an approximately equal share of the total value, or at least a fair share based on the constraints. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Review the valuations for each agent to identify items they value highly.
2. Allocate items to agents in a manner that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Has a high valuation for item 5 (71). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0, who also values item 3 (65). 
- **Agent 1**: Highly values item 8 (91). Let's allocate item 8 to Agent 1. 
- **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for several items, particularly 3 (94) and 1 (89). Let's allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Values items 4 (81) and 5 (79) highly. However, since item 5 is already allocated, let's allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Continuing the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: We can also allocate items 0 (10) and 2 (29) to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 7 (33) to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Item 6 (68) can be allocated to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 4 to Agent 3, ensuring they also get a fair share.

Final allocation summary:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [1, 3, 6],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a selection that reflects their preferences as fairly as possible given the constraints.
