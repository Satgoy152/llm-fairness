Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  12  97  14  15  44  25  68  65
1  31  39  20  31  77  87  58  61  31
2  36  80  74  85   9  73  25   0  21
3  76   8  52   1  94  78  46  11  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring all items are assigned and each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. If there are any conflicts (i.e., multiple agents value the same item equally), resolve them by considering the overall distribution and aim for balance.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the table provided:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 94 (highest).
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 80 (highest).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 97 (highest).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 85 (highest).
5. Item 4: Agent 3 values it at 94 (highest).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 87 (highest).
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 58 (highest).
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 68 (highest).
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 65 (highest).

Now, let's check the distribution:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 3: Items [4]

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, while distributing all 9 items. 

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7, 8],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
