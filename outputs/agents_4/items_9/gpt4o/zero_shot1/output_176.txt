Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  50  23  29  78  48  37  53  94
1  40  86  24  17   7  45  49  23  16
2   9  66  22   0  61  54  73  68  69
3  43  52  37  64  10  86  32   6  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we can aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least some items. Given there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent can get at least 2 items, with one agent getting an additional item.

Let's try to distribute the items by examining the valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (94), Item 4 (78)
   - Allocate items 8 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (86), Item 0 (40)
   - Allocate items 1 and 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (73), Item 7 (68)
   - Allocate items 6 and 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (86), Item 3 (64)
   - Allocate items 5 and 3 to Agent 3.

Now, let's check if all items are allocated:
- Items 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are allocated, leaving item 2 unallocated.

Since item 2 remains, we need to allocate it to one of the agents. The agent with the highest valuation for item 2 is Agent 3, so we'll allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
