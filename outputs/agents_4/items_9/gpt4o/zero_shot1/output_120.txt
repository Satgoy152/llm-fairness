Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96   3  42  16  98  80  49  58  43
1  87  13  91   9  86  32  52   9  96
2  29  68  56  48  71  44  99  23  14
3  84  99   3   8  16   6  64  29   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. We will ensure each agent receives at least one item, given there are four agents and nine items. This allocation may not be optimal from a total valuation perspective, but it is a simple heuristic to ensure fair distribution.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 0: Item 4 (98), Item 0 (96), Item 5 (80)
   - Assign Item 4 and Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 1: Item 8 (96), Item 2 (91), Item 0 (87)
   - Assign Item 8 and Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 2: Item 6 (99), Item 4 (71), Item 1 (68)
   - Assign Item 6 and Item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 3: Item 1 (99), Item 0 (84), Item 6 (64)
   - Assign Item 3 and Item 7 to Agent 3.

Now let's convert this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [8, 2],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, with a total of nine items distributed as per the constraints.
