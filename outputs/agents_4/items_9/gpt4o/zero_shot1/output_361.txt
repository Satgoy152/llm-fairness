Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  23  64  49  36  91  13  23  56
1  49  58  17  69  45   0  82  47  91
2  44  56  12  99  32  38  16  37  98
3  72  56  37  14  16  26  53  42  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. We want to consider the preferences of each agent and try to maximize their total valuation while distributing the items fairly.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most.

2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, while also considering their total valuation.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 8
- Agent 2 receives items: 4, 7
- Agent 3 receives items: 2, 5

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, and aims to satisfy their preferences as much as possible.
