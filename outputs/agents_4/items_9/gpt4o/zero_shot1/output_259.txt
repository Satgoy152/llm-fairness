Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  98  64  56  43  71  82  99  77
1   5  48   8  77  16   2   5   0  27
2  74   6  36  67  18  96  71   5  34
3  89  23   3  38  87  62  33  79  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations such that each agent maximizes their value while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items. We will aim to distribute items so that the total valuation is maximized while maintaining fairness.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the highest (89), so allocate item 0 to agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest (98), so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest (64), so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest (77), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the highest (87), so allocate item 4 to agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the highest (96), so allocate item 5 to agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the highest (82), so allocate item 6 to agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the highest (99), so allocate item 7 to agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it the highest (77), so allocate item 8 to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations as per the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated while maximizing the agents' valuations.
