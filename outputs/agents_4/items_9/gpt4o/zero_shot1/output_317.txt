Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  88  32  64  22  77  38  30  68
1  37  99  70  26  45  89  32   7  56
2  55  92  80  65  78  37  56  61  36
3  40  42  30  15  32  43  37  69  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to ensure that the allocation is balanced and takes into account the valuations provided. We'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness among the agents, possibly by maximizing the total utility each agent receives from their allocated items.

Let's consider the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 5.
   - We can allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Has a very high valuation for item 1, but since item 1 is already allocated, let's look at their next highest valuations.
   - Allocate items 2 and 5 to Agent 1, as they have high valuations for item 2 and item 5 is already taken.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 2, 4, and 8.
   - Allocate items 4 and 8 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Has the least overall potential for high-value items compared to others but has moderate valuations across many items.
   - Allocate items 0, 3, 6, and 7 to Agent 3.

Now let's ensure all items are accounted for and adjust if necessary.

Re-evaluating:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 6 (instead of 5 due to overlap)
- Agent 2: Items 4, 8
- Agent 3: Items 0, 3, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [0, 3, 7]
}
```
