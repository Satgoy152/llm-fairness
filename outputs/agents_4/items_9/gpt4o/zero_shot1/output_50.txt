Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  85  39  50  53  14  69  78  25
1  28  80  86  81  64  67  94  43  72
2  81  17   0  98  74  13   8  35  35
3   2  96  46  96   0  87  24  10  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's consider each agent's highest-value items and try to allocate them accordingly, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item wherever possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are items 1 (85) and 7 (78).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are items 6 (94) and 2 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are items 3 (98) and 4 (74).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are items 1 (96) and 3 (96), but these are already chosen. The next highest is item 5 (87).

Based on these preferences and to ensure each agent receives items, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 (66) and 7 (78)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 (80) and 6 (94)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 (98) and 4 (74)
- **Agent 3**: Items 5 (87), 2 (46) and 8 (60)

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5, 2, 8]
}
```
