Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  33  86  10  47  92  67  59  52
1  76  85  46  58  23  85  47  68  99
2   3  22  65  39  88  43  23   1  96
3  80  91  35  19  62  89  90  63  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to maximize their total satisfaction. We will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately the same total valuation.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 2, 5 (Values: 86, 92)
   - Total Value: 178

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 0, 7, 8 (Values: 76, 68, 99)
   - Total Value: 243

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 4, 6 (Values: 88, 23)
   - Total Value: 111

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: 1, 3 (Values: 91, 19)
   - Total Value: 110

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 7, 8],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
