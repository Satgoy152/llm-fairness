Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  42  27  41  97  80  20  97  31
1  40  82  49   6  32  84  13  84  93
2  33   6  82   2  96  28  42  99  33
3  61  94   2   2  54  99  64  27  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent receives an approximately equal value of items, given the constraints. We'll try to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 97)
2. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 84)
3. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 99)
4. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value 94)
5. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 37)
6. Assign item 8 to agent 1 (value 93)
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 42)
8. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 2)
9. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 82)

This allocation aims to give each agent a reasonable distribution of their highest-valued items while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [7, 6, 2],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated the items such that the total number of items is 9, and the distribution attempts to take into account the relative valuation of each item by each agent.
