Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  78  39  44  16  79  72  81  82
1  34  65  61   5  13  71  33  72  35
2  23  88  44  35   5  44  38  76  15
3  47  67  72   3  15   8  46  98  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible. We have 9 items and 4 agents, so ideally, each agent should receive about 2 to 3 items.

Let's start with a greedy allocation approach, where we attempt to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives. 

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Valuations: [74, 34, 23, 47]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (74)

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Valuations: [78, 65, 88, 67]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 2 (88)

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Valuations: [39, 61, 44, 72]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 3 (72)

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Valuations: [44, 5, 35, 3]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (44)

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Valuations: [16, 13, 5, 15]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (16)

6. **Item 5:** 
   - Valuations: [79, 71, 44, 8]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (79)
   - However, assigning another item to Agent 0 would be unfair, so we assign it to Agent 1 (71)

7. **Item 6:** 
   - Valuations: [72, 33, 38, 46]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (72)
   - However, Agent 0 has enough items, so we assign it to Agent 3 (46)

8. **Item 7:** 
   - Valuations: [81, 72, 76, 98]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 3 (98)
   - However, Agent 3 has enough items, so we assign it to Agent 2 (76)

9. **Item 8:** 
   - Valuations: [82, 35, 15, 24]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (82)
   - However, Agent 0 has enough items, so we assign it to Agent 1 (35)

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable number of items, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.
