Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  35  19  87  85  36  13  69  90
1  10  12  17  80  68  98  93  36  25
2  28  49  35  89  34  34  58  48  57
3  82  20  45  30  33  50  87  49  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's preferences. A common approach is to use a round-robin allocation or a form of optimization where we try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives approximately the same number of items.

Let's evaluate the table and make a fair allocation of the items to the agents:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High value items: 0 (54), 3 (87), 4 (85), 8 (90)
   - Allocate items: 0, 3

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High value items: 5 (98), 6 (93), 3 (80), 4 (68)
   - Allocate items: 5, 6

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High value items: 3 (89), 1 (49), 6 (58), 8 (57)
   - Allocate items: 3, 1

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High value items: 0 (82), 6 (87), 8 (59), 5 (50)
   - Allocate items: 0, 6

However, we must ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and total allocations equal 9. Let's adjust the allocation to balance this:

- Agent 0: 3 items
- Agent 1: 2 items
- Agent 2: 2 items
- Agent 3: 2 items

Let's finalize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 7]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
