Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  58  97  48  96  55  97  68  10
1  71   4  99  98  10  26  52  46  90
2  39  42  62  52  99  39  28  76  68
3  38  23  79  30  96  44  13   7  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider a way to balance the total value of items each agent receives, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. An optimal allocation would maximize the total satisfaction for all agents.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation plan:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 6 (value 97 each). Let's assign these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 2 (already allocated). The next highest value is item 3 (value 98). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 4 (value 99). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 4 (already allocated). The next highest value is item 2 (already allocated). The next is item 0 (value 38). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Remaining Items**: Items 1, 5, 7, and 8 are left unallocated.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items based on the highest remaining valued items for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 7 (value 68).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 8 (value 90).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (value 39).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 1 (value 23).

By following this allocation method, we ensure all items are fairly distributed while maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair share of items based on their relative valuations.
