Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  19  29  44  34  28  73   0  12
1  94  23  92  84  39  69  71  61  88
2  41  92  99  81  98  85  93  69  61
3  11  90  20  81  13  35  30  17  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. **Evaluate the Highest Valuations**: We'll look at which agent values each item the most.
2. **Allocate Based on Maximum Valuation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. **Ensure Fair Distribution**: Adjust if necessary to ensure each agent receives at least some items if possible, or to balance the total number of items.

Let's evaluate the highest valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 95.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 92.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 99.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 84.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 98.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 85.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 93.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 61.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 88.

From the above, the initial allocations based on maximum valuations would be:

- Agent 0: 0
- Agent 1: 3, 7, 8
- Agent 2: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Agent 3: (none)

However, Agent 3 currently has no items, so we should consider adjustments to include them. We can make adjustments by considering items where the allocation is less critical to the maximizing agent. The goal is minimal impact on the overall valuation while ensuring everyone gets an item.

A potential adjustment might be:

- Give item 1 to Agent 3, since Agent 2 already has several items, and Agent 3 values it second-highest after Agent 2.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 7, 8],
    "2": [2, 4, 5, 6],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated remains 9.
