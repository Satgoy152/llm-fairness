Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  85  45  93  23  45  86   0   8
1  44  21  28  27  98  40  73  77   1
2  74  88  78  97  41  61  58  52  38
3  63  64  51  33  75  61  76  43  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 3 with a value of 93.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 4 with a value of 98.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 3 with a value of 97, but it is already assigned to Agent 0.
   - Next highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 1 with a value of 88.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item for Agent 3 is item 6 with a value of 76.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

After ensuring each agent has at least one item, we continue allocating the remaining items to maximize total individual agent values:

5. **Remaining items**: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8

   - **Agent 0**: 
     - Assign item 0 (value 49) to Agent 0 (next highest available).

   - **Agent 1**: 
     - Assign item 7 (value 77) to Agent 1 (next highest available).

   - **Agent 2**: 
     - Assign item 2 (value 78) to Agent 2 (next highest available).

   - **Agent 3**:
     - Assign item 5 (value 61) to Agent 3 (next highest available).

   - The last remaining item is 8. Assign it to the agent who benefits the most from it.
     - Assign item 8 (value 46) to Agent 3.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [6, 5, 8]
}
```
