Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0   7  59  34  22  51  44  77  47
1  63  57  66   3  42  14  75  40  59
2  81  67  26  65  78  85  18  15  95
3  20   1  94  61  17  85  85  55  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets items that maximize their individual valuations. Given that there are 4 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive 3 items while the others will receive 2 items each.

Here's one approach to fairly distribute the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each item.
2. Use a greedy method to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives the correct number of items.

Allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 8
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5, 6
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [4, 5, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
