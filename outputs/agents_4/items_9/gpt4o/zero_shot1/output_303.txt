Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  63   0  82   2  13   2  35  80
1  45  16  82   9  45  76  42   6   6
2  46  46  76  16  31  64  46  66  76
3  61  84  73  61  22  26  19  46  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent receives approximately the same value, considering their individual valuations. This doesn't necessarily mean each agent gets the same number of items, but rather that the total value of the items they receive is balanced across all agents.

Let's allocate the items in a way that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while keeping the allocations fair.

1. Agent 0 values item 3 at 82 and item 8 at 80. We can allocate these two high-value items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 at 82. We can allocate this item to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values items 2 and 8 at 76, but since these are already allocated, we look at the next highest values. We can allocate items 6 and 8 to Agent 2, as these are among the highest remaining values for this agent.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 at 84. We allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Now we have allocated 5 items. Let's distribute the remaining items:

5. Agent 0 can also receive item 0, as it's the highest remaining value for them.
6. Agent 1 can receive item 5, which they value at 76.
7. Agent 2 can receive item 7, valued at 66.
8. Agent 3 can receive item 4, valued at 22.

All 9 items are now allocated while trying to keep the distribution fair across all agents.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
