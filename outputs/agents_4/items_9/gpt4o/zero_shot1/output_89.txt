Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  72  50  75  54   2  30  42  79
1  96  12  40  63  72  86   0   3   8
2  62  96  49  80  14  56  68  18  25
3  67  62  93  86  16  28  84  26  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value of all items. One way to achieve this is by calculating the total value of items for each agent and then assigning items to agents in a manner that balances the total value each agent receives.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 22 + 72 + 50 + 75 + 54 + 2 + 30 + 42 + 79 = 426
- Agent 1's total value: 96 + 12 + 40 + 63 + 72 + 86 + 0 + 3 + 8 = 380
- Agent 2's total value: 62 + 96 + 49 + 80 + 14 + 56 + 68 + 18 + 25 = 468
- Agent 3's total value: 67 + 62 + 93 + 86 + 16 + 28 + 84 + 26 + 24 = 486

Next, we need to fairly distribute the 9 items among the 4 agents. We can attempt to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to individual items, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations:
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (75) and Item 8 (79)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (96) and Item 5 (86)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (96) and Item 6 (68)
   - Agent 3: Item 2 (93) and Item 7 (26)

2. Assign the remaining items:
   - Item 4 to Agent 0 (54)

Now we check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [3, 8, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [1, 6]
- Agent 3: [2, 7]

This allocation distributes the items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total value based on their valuations. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```
