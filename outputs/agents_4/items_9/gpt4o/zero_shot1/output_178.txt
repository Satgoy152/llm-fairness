Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  15  88  85   6  58  22  36  17
1  71  61  14  87  86   7  57  19  48
2   4  10  29  11  91  44  86  80  16
3  91  24  74  90  87  57  69   1  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the given valuations and attempt to distribute the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (88), Item 3 (85), Item 0 (62)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (87), Item 4 (86), Item 0 (71)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (91), Item 6 (86), Item 7 (80)
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (91), Item 3 (90), Item 4 (87)

Let's allocate the items based on these valuations, aiming to give each agent some of their highest valued items:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest for Agent 1 and a good distribution).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (second highest for Agent 2).
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest available for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest available for Agent 1).
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (next highest for Agent 2).
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 1 (next highest available for Agent 1).

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 1, 8],
    "2": [4, 6, 7],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some of their highest valued items while distributing all 9 items fairly among the agents.
