Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  44  79  19  10  50   9  52  10
1  14  72  18  47  12  15  47  18  21
2  75  81  93  47  46  71   8  74  55
3   4  81  10  97   7  97  44   0  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to give each agent a set of items that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive 2 items and some will receive 3 items. Let's consider an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values items 2 and 7 highly. 
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values items 1 and 3 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values items 0, 2, and 5 highly.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values items 3, 5, and 8 highly.

Let's try to allocate items so that each agent gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 7 (total value = 44 + 52 = 96)
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 4 (total value = 47 + 12 = 59)
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 6, 5 (total value = 75 + 8 + 71 = 154)
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 8 (total value = 10 + 88 = 98)

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 6, 5],
    "3": [2, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair and optimal share of the items based on their valuations.
