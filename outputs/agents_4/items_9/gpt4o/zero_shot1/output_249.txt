Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37   6   8  96  86   0  73  48  60
1  52  44  77  39  99  27  37  38  73
2  68  23   3  38  53  86  99   5  66
3  80  69  82  61  62  57  92  28  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 7] with a total value of 96 + 48 = 144
- Agent 1: Items [4, 8] with a total value of 99 + 73 = 172
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6] with a total value of 86 + 99 = 185
- Agent 3: Items [0, 1, 2] with a total value of 80 + 69 + 82 = 231

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
