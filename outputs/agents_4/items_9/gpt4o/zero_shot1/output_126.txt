Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  57  86  75  94  50  58  15   0
1  80  85  81  37  13  57  58  35  28
2   8  12  63   8  69  21  90  88  38
3  45  65  17  76  90  67  93  11   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items they are allocated. Let's evaluate the valuations for each agent and assign items to balance the total valuations as best as possible.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 6, 7, and 4.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 4, 5, and 6.

We'll attempt to distribute the items to maximize utility among the agents while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share.

Here's a fair allocation:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value: 94), item 2 (value: 86), and item 0 (value: 60).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value: 85), item 3 (value: 37), and item 5 (value: 57).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value: 90) and item 7 (value: 88).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3 (value: 8).

The allocations can be represented in the requested JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [8]
}
```

This allocation is an attempt to balance the total valuation each agent receives, given the constraints of integer allocations and a total of 9 items.
