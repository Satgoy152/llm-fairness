Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  42  41  42   5  81  82  79  47
1  13  72   6  12  69  54  23  85  35
2  14  74  19  32   6  97  57  26  84
3  78  70  26  99   1  62  54  74  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives by allocating items where they have relatively high valuations, while ensuring each agent gets approximately an equal number of items.

Given the table, we need to assign the 9 items to the 4 agents. We can aim for each agent to receive 2 or 3 items, since 9 items need to be distributed among 4 agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5, 6, and 7.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 7.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5 and 8.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3 and 0.

By considering these high valuations and trying to distribute the items evenly, we can propose the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 5, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 8 and 2.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 or 3 items, and each agent gets items they value relatively highly. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [8, 2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
