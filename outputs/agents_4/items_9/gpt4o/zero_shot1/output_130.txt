Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  38  49  71  40  42  68  53  51
1  10  26  33  99  20  98  44  71  79
2  59   8  26  99  91  37   0  33  70
3  48  14   0  99   4  64  96  81  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and aim to maximize their satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We also need to ensure all items are allocated without exceeding the number of items given in the table.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 has high values for items: 0 (95), 3 (71), and 6 (68).
   - Agent 1 has high values for items: 3 (99), 5 (98), and 8 (79).
   - Agent 2 has high values for items: 3 (99), 4 (91), and 8 (70).
   - Agent 3 has high values for items: 3 (99), 6 (96), and 7 (81).

2. **Allocate Items Based on Preferences:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it has the highest single valuation of any item.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1, since they also highly value this item.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3, as it is highly valued by them.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as they have a high valuation for it.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 3, since it is one of their top-valued items.
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 2, as they value it highly.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is one of the remaining items and Agent 0 could use another item.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 to complete their allocation.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:**
   - After these allocations, each agent should have received some items, and all 9 items are distributed.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and that all items are allocated.
