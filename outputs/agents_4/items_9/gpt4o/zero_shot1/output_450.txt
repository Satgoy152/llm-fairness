Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  54  14  25  31  57  54  73  35
1  41  52  94  68  57  83  88  95  10
2  29  56  11  33  47  16   6  99   4
3  46  37  20  31   7  72  14  49  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for different items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents. We also need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 0, 5, and 7.
- Agent 1 values items 2, 5, 6, and 7 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most and has a moderate valuation for items 4 and 1.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5 and moderate valuations for items 3 and 8.

We'll make allocations by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

After analyzing the table and considering the constraints, here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 8],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, which are among the highest valued for them.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 6, which are highly valued by them.
- Agent 2 receives items 3, 4, and 8, considering moderate to high valuations.
- Agent 3 receives items 5 and 7, which are among the highest valued for them.

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are distributed and every agent receives at least one item.
