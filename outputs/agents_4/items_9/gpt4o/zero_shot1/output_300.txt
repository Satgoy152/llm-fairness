Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  94  78  14  26  57  18  57  82
1  93  76  45  97  99  43  71  30  16
2  22  18  95  49  47  85  25  81  62
3  65  38  48  31  42  51  60  48  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, I will consider distributing the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and that all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items one by one, starting with the highest value for each agent, and ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuations for items 1 (94) and 0 (82).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuations for items 4 (99) and 3 (97).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuations for items 2 (95) and 5 (85).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuations for items 0 (65) and 6 (60).

Allocate items based on these highest values, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

Agent 0: [1, 0]
Agent 1: [4, 3]
Agent 2: [2, 5]
Agent 3: [6]

With items 1, 0, 4, 3, 2, 5, and 6 allocated, there are 2 items left: 7 and 8.

Find the agents with the next highest values for the remaining items:

- Agent 0 values item 7 at 57.
- Agent 2 values item 8 at 62.

Allocate these items accordingly to maximize fairness:

Agent 0: [1, 0, 7]
Agent 1: [4, 3]
Agent 2: [2, 5, 8]
Agent 3: [6]

Now, each agent has received at least one item, and all items have been allocated. The JSON allocation representation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 7],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2, 5, 8],
    "3": [6]
}
```
