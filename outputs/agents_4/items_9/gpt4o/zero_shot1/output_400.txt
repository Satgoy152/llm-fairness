Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  54  45  18  52  30  71  77  29
1  68  22  85  81   1  53  83  40  35
2  62  57  57  42   1  74  43   5   2
3  46   3  67  94  99   6  98  29  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest value each agent assigns to the items, but ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed and each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

Let's begin by looking at the table:

```
Agent 0: 93, 54, 45, 18, 52, 30, 71, 77, 29
Agent 1: 68, 22, 85, 81, 1, 53, 83, 40, 35
Agent 2: 62, 57, 57, 42, 1, 74, 43, 5, 2
Agent 3: 46, 3, 67, 94, 99, 6, 98, 29, 13
```

Now, allocate the items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (93 is the highest value for item 0).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (57 is the highest value for item 1).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (85 is the highest value for item 2).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (94 is the highest value for item 3).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (99 is the highest value for item 4).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (74 is the highest value for item 5).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (71 is the highest value for item 6).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (77 is the highest value for item 7).
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 1 (35 is the highest value for item 8).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution is fairly balanced. Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 8.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 3 receives items 3 and 4.

This ensures that all 9 items are allocated fairly among the agents.
