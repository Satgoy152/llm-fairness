Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48   1  23  42  59  47  83  95  57
1  91  76  19  30  81  80  12  61  44
2  19  48  83  48  33  91  54  30  43
3  19  79  17   2  44  20  88  95  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. One approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and each item is assigned exactly once.

Let's allocate items to agents based on maximizing the total value each agent gets.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (95), Item 6 (83), Item 4 (59)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (91), Item 4 (81), Item 5 (80)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (91), Item 2 (83), Item 1 (48)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (95), Item 6 (88), Item 1 (79)

We will prioritize assigning each agent their highest valued item that has not already been assigned to another agent, considering that each agent should ideally receive at least one item.

**Final Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Assign Item 7 (95) and Item 6 (83) to Agent 0 (highest unallocated items)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Assign Item 0 (91) and Item 5 (80) to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Assign Item 2 (83) to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Assign Item 1 (79) and Item 8 (30) to Agent 3

5. **Remaining Items:**
   - Assign Item 3 (42) and Item 4 (59) to Agent 0

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, each agent gets an item, and the total value is distributed fairly based on the preferences. 

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 8, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated.
