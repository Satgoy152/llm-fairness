Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  86  84  60  12  74  36  16  65
1  54  11  82  64  50  36   6   5  71
2  35  55  80   8  74  97  36  51  51
3  76  51  79  21  51  35  75   3  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total value for each agent, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. We also have to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   We check which agent values each item the most and aim to allocate that item to the respective agent.

2. **Ensure Fairness Across Agents:**
   We need to ensure that the distribution is fair and no agent is left without an item unless it is impossible to allocate otherwise. Since there are 4 agents and 9 items, one agent will end up with fewer items.

3. **Check and Adjust for Fairness:**
   After initial allocation, we ensure that no agent ends up far worse than others. If necessary, adjust allocations to attempt to balance the value distribution across agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on the highest valuation for each item, adjusting as necessary for fairness:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (76)
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (86)
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (84)
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (64)
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (74)
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (97)
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most (75)
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (51)
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it the most (71)

Now, let's check if this distribution is fair and make necessary adjustments:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent gets items, with Agent 2 getting one more item due to the higher valuations. This is a reasonably fair distribution based on the given values.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [4, 5, 7],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
