Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  91   4  23  38  49  71  67  46
1  45   9  12  32  48   8  78  30  20
2  30  34  65  73  59  57  71  53  44
3  48  16  84  98  40  76  45  28  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we need to ensure each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
2. Agent 1 has relatively balanced interest but should receive items where they place relatively higher value.
3. Agent 2 shows interest in item 2 and 3.
4. Agent 3 places high value on item 3 and 5.

Let's proceed by assigning items to each agent:

- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 4 and 8 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 2 and 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign items 3, 5, and 7 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, while attempting to respect their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 5, 7]
}
```
