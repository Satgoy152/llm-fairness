Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  28  12  82  74   5  74  33  79
1   9  82  27  86  86  39  97  60  40
2   2  13  18  80  11  22  81  53  78
3  23  19  93   1  79  39  24  44  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, not every agent will receive the same number of items, but we will try to distribute them as evenly as possible.

Let's evaluate the agents' valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (82), 4 (74), 6 (74), 8 (79)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (86), 4 (86), 6 (97), 1 (82)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (80), 6 (81), 8 (78)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (93), 4 (79), 8 (41)

Now, let's assign the items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Assign item 3 (82) and 8 (79) to Agent 0 since these are among the highest value items for Agent 0.

- **Agent 1**:
  - Assign item 6 (97) and 4 (86) to Agent 1 since these are the highest value items for Agent 1.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Assign item 3 is already taken; assign item 6 is already taken; assign item 8 is already taken; 
  - Assign item 7 (53) to Agent 2 as it is the next highest value item for Agent 2.

- **Agent 3**:
  - Assign item 2 (93) and 4 is already taken; assign item 0 (23) to Agent 3.

Now, let's consider the remaining items:

- Item 1 and 5 are unallocated.
- Assign item 1 (82) to Agent 1 who values it highly.
- Assign item 5 (39) to Agent 3 as it is one of the next highest values left.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [6, 4, 1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair set of items based on their preferences, and all 9 items are distributed.
