Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  68  18  21  10  82  74  60  99
1  80  11  22  96  99  11  46  94  92
2  16  40  88  14  11   2  79  30  59
3  53  81  91  35   5  73  44  96  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by considering their valuations for each item. One common method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring that each agent receives a relatively equal number of items when possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Assign items to the agent who values them the most:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (value 80)
   - Item 1: Agent 3 (value 81)
   - Item 2: Agent 3 (value 91)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (value 96)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (value 99)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (value 82)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 (value 79)
   - Item 7: Agent 3 (value 96)
   - Item 8: Agent 0 (value 99)

2. **Distribute items evenly:**
   - Currently, Agent 1 and Agent 3 have 3 items each, Agent 0 has 2 items, and Agent 2 has 1 item.
   - To ensure even distribution, consider reallocating items or giving priority to agents with fewer items.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [5, 8]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 4]
   - Agent 2: Items [6]
   - Agent 3: Items [1, 2, 7]

This allocation provides a fair distribution while respecting each agent's valuation of the items. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 2, 7]
}
```
