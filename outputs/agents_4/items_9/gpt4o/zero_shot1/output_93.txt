Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  94  25  48  90  89  68  17  85
1  91  29  68  78   6  11   7  39  58
2  31  21   8  36  36  53   9  39  53
3  52  49  54  33  31  19  41  75  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items to get a sense of their preferences.
2. Start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that the allocations remain balanced across all agents.

Let's proceed with this approach:

### Valuation Table

| Agent | Total Value |
|-------|-------------|
| 0     | 555         |
| 1     | 387         |
| 2     | 286         |
| 3     | 451         |

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0** values items 1 (94) and 4 (90) highly.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 (91) highly.
3. **Agent 3** values item 8 (97) highly.
4. **Agent 2** may take items that are less valued by others.

### Allocations

- **Agent 0**: [1, 4] (valuations = 94, 90)
- **Agent 1**: [0, 3, 6] (valuations = 91, 78, 7)
- **Agent 2**: [5] (valuations = 53)
- **Agent 3**: [2, 7, 8] (valuations = 54, 75, 97)

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their higher valuation preferences while keeping the total number of items allocated to 9.
