Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  14  20  45  31  69  28  40   2
1  81  88  74  17  18  37  49  28  24
2  80  31  37  84  81  87   4  76  41
3  64  64  62  66  69  90  21  22  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 64 62 66 69 90 21 22 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable value from the items they receive. One common approach is to assign items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values are for items 5 (69), 0 (66), and 3 (45).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values are for items 1 (88), 0 (81), and 2 (74).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values are for items 5 (87), 3 (84), and 4 (81).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values are for items 5 (90), 8 (82), and 4 (69).

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the total value each agent can get:

- **Item 5**: 
  - Agent 3 has the highest value for item 5 (90), so allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 1 values it at 81, which is the highest, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 1 values it at 88, which is the highest, so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 1 values it at 74, which is the highest, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 2 has a high value for item 3 (84), so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 2 values it at 81, which is the highest, so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

- **Item 6**: 
  - Agent 1 has the highest remaining value for item 6 (49), so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

- **Item 7**: 
  - Agent 2 has a high value for item 7 (76), so allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

- **Item 8**: 
  - Agent 3 values it at 82, so allocate item 8 to Agent 3.

Now let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 7],
    "3": [5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated among the agents, and each agent receives items that are of high value to them based on their preferences.
