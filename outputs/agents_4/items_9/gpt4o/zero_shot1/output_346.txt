Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  15  75  24  75  56  10  69  18
1  25  69  38   7  91  86  23  94  60
2  92  23  25  56  95  37  36  29  23
3  21  47  24  25  84   3  70  74   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations of each agent and make sure each agent gets at least two items, as there are 9 items and 4 agents. Let's try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: We look for items with high valuations for agent 0. Items 0 (77) and 2 (75) are highly valued by agent 0.
- Agent 1: We select items that agent 1 values highly, such as items 4 (91) and 7 (94).
- Agent 2: Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 4 (95) and 0 (92), but since item 4 is already allocated to agent 1, we allocate item 3 (56) and item 5 (37) to agent 2.
- Agent 3: Agent 3 can be allocated items with relatively high valuations for them, such as item 7 (74) and item 6 (70).

Now let's write the allocation in the given JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1, 6, 8]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 7.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 5.
- Agent 3 receives items 1, 6, and 8.

This distribution ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their individual valuations.
