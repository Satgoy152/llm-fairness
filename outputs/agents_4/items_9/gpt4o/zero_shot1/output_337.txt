Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  63  53  14  20  78  79  15   2
1  87  87  17  91  12  92   1  12  72
2  28  76  96  93  18  97  67  76  81
3  28  81  37  43  85  88   7  10  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives according to their preferences, ensuring each agent gets at least one item since there are 9 items and 4 agents. One approach is to assign the highest valued items to each agent first and then distribute the remaining items if necessary.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item:
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (value 79)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (value 92)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (value 97)
   - Agent 3: Item 5 (value 88) - Since Item 5 is already taken, we consider the next highest available item for Agent 3, which is Item 4 (value 85).

2. Continue allocating the remaining items based on descending order of value for each agent while ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent:

   - Agent 0: After item 6, next highest available items are items 5 (78), 1 (63), 0 (62), etc.
   - Agent 1: After item 5, next highest available items are items 3 (91), 0 (87), 1 (87), etc.
   - Agent 2: After item 5, next highest available items are items 3 (93), 1 (76), 7 (76), etc.
   - Agent 3: After item 4, next highest available items are items 1 (81), 5 (88), 0 (28), etc.

3. Make sure to check the total number of items allocated sums to 9.

Taking this into consideration, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [4, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their highest preferences while distributing all 9 items.
