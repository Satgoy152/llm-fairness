Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  18  10  70  56  31  26  76  35
1  52  54  66  81  70  62  99  43  40
2  83  12  56   3  84  63  43  61  11
3  12  78  55   0  29  88  35  49  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll try to assign items such that each agent gets a total value as high as possible, considering the constraints.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, provided that each agent gets at least one item. If there is a tie in valuations, consider the overall distribution and try to balance the number of items each agent receives.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Highest value is 83 by agent 2.
- Item 1: Highest value is 78 by agent 3.
- Item 2: Highest value is 66 by agent 1.
- Item 3: Highest value is 81 by agent 1.
- Item 4: Highest value is 84 by agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest value is 88 by agent 3.
- Item 6: Highest value is 99 by agent 1.
- Item 7: Highest value is 76 by agent 0.
- Item 8: Highest value is 40 by agent 1.

Now, let's allocate the items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 7 (value 76)
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 6, 8 (values 66, 81, 99, 40)
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4 (values 83, 84)
- Agent 3: Item 1, 5 (values 78, 88)

Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here is the json format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 8],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
