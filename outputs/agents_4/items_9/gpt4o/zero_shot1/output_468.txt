Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  51  28  89  83  51  71  68  97
1  48  84  86  80  72  37  22  74  59
2   9  70   5  93  74   2  14  11   8
3  82  82  38  92  89  11  38  83  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items based on the highest values for agent 0.
   - Item 8 (value: 97)
   - Item 3 (value: 89)

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items based on the highest values for agent 1.
   - Item 2 (value: 86)
   - Item 1 (value: 84)

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items based on the highest values for agent 2.
   - Item 3 (value: 93)
   - Item 4 (value: 74)

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items based on the highest values for agent 3.
   - Item 0 (value: 82)
   - Item 7 (value: 83)
   - Item 5 (value: 11)

Now, let's ensure each agent has at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated:

- Agent 0 receives items [8, 3] with a total value of 186.
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 1] with a total value of 170.
- Agent 2 receives items [4, 6] with a total value of 88.
- Agent 3 receives items [0, 7, 5] with a total value of 176.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 7, 5]
}
```
