Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93   4  73  39  97  63  49  82  79
1   1  86  40  34  63  20  18  58  28
2  14  42  54  56  82  94  64  85  93
3  45  89  83  38  26  67   7   6  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that all items are allocated and that each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations provided, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 4. We can allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 5 and 8. We can allocate these items to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 3. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. We still have items 2, 6, and 7 left. To distribute these fairly:

   - **Agent 0** would benefit from item 2, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 2** benefits from item 6, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
   - **Agent 1** can take item 7 as it has a moderate value compared to others.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their total valuation based on the given preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5, 6, 8],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 4 agents.
