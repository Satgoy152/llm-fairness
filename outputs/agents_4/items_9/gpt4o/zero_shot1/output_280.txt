Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  53  43  63  71  48  69  68  62
1  80  35  51  58   4  13  37  24  29
2  80  69  88   0  74  38   2  64  24
3  60  68  95  33  13  69  67  98  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations and try to balance the total value received by each agent. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a comparable total value based on their preferences.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 6. We can allocate item 0 to Agent 0 for a high value of 76.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 2 for a value of 51.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most, but it's allocated. Next, item 4 is valued at 74.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 7 at 98, which is unallocated. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

5. **Continue with remaining items**:
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 69).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 63).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 (value 69).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 69).
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 1 (value 29).

Upon reviewing, each agent receives items based on their preferences, ensuring a fair distribution of values.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
