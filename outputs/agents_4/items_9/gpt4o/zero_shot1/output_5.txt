Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  49  73  93  89  51  64   2  26
1  84  61  23  96  24  48  43  57  92
2  59  24  86  71  97  67  36  63  90
3  21  54  28  21   2   8  49  23  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total value for each agent. We will allocate items based on the highest value an agent assigns to them, ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Allocate based on highest value:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This will ensure that each item is going to the agent who appreciates it the most, maximizing individual satisfaction.

2. **Check and adjust allocation:**
   - Ensure that the total number of items allocated is 9 and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Below is the allocation based on the highest value each agent places on the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (value 84)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 49)
- Item 2: Agent 2 (value 86)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (value 96)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (value 97)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (value 67)
- Item 6: Agent 3 (value 49)
- Item 7: Agent 2 (value 63)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (value 92)

Now, let's compile these allocations into the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3, 8],
    "2": [2, 4, 5, 7],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.
