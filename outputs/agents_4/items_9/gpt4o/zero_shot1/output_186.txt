Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  30  69  79  71  51  75   5  54
1  36  47  86  45   0  82  80   4  81
2   6   0  58  60  86  60  20  47  15
3  73   7  40   0  84  15  53  46  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents in rounds based on the highest valuation for remaining items.

Here's one way we might allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the most, so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most, so we assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 highly, but it's already taken. Agent 3 values item 3 highly, so we assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 1 values item 5 highly, so we assign item 5 to Agent 1.
6. Agent 0 values item 6 highly, so we assign item 6 to Agent 0.
7. Agent 3 values item 8 highly, so we assign item 8 to Agent 3.
8. Agent 1 values item 1 highly, so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
9. Agent 2 values item 7 highly, so we assign item 7 to Agent 2.

This is one possible allocation that respects the integer allocation requirement:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 5, 1],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [3, 8]
}
```

Each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
