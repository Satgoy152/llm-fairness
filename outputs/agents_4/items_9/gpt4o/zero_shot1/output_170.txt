Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  81  66  60  36  16  28  83  64
1  44  70  56   2   3  55  57  96  10
2  76  65  95   2  29  44  49  98  52
3  26   6  25  63  94  84  68  53  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's proceed with a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values items 1 and 7 the highest (81 and 83 respectively). Allocate items 1 and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 7 the highest, but it's already allocated. The next highest valued item is 0 (44). Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 7 the highest, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 2 (95). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (94). Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

5. **Remaining Items**: Items 3, 5, 6, and 8 are unallocated. Allocate these remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

   - **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 8 are valued moderately (60 and 64). Allocate item 8 to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 1**: Items 5 and 6 are valued moderately (55 and 57). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 for a moderate value (2).
   - **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 for a moderate value (68).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed.
