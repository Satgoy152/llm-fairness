Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  46  35  80  86  41  87  16  40
1  20  99  35  40  64  36  63   9  48
2  85   6  10  24  57  22  13  90  79
3  53  42  18  53  12  58  53  89  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all 9 items being allocated.

Let's start by examining the highest values each agent has for the items and attempt to allocate based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (92), Item 3 (80), Item 4 (86), Item 6 (87)
   - Let's allocate Items 0, 3, and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (99), Item 4 (64), Item 8 (48)
   - Since Item 4 is already taken, let's allocate Item 1 (99) and Item 8 (48) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 7 (90), Item 8 (79)
   - Item 8 is already taken, so allocate Item 7 (90) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (58), Item 7 (89)
   - Item 7 is already taken, so allocate Item 5 (58) to Agent 3.

### Check Remaining Items:
- Items allocated: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Remaining items: 2, 6

5. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 has Item 6 (87) as a high value, allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.
   - For Item 2, Agent 0 has the highest value (35), allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.
