Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  94  51  12  16  49  76  85  68
1  19  87  21  87  54  30  82  94  85
2  60  56  70  39   0  42  57  20  96
3  26  53  59  37   2  78  66  59  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple approach that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

One way to do this is to assign items based on which agent values them the most, ensuring that no agent is left without any items, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items fairly:

1. **Assign the highest valued item for each agent:** Start by giving each agent the item they value the most.

2. **Assign the remaining items:** Distribute the remaining items by assigning them to the agent who values them the most and who has not yet received their fair share (in this case, at least 2 items per agent since there are 9 items and 4 agents).

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Initialize the allocations:**
   - Agent 0: []
   - Agent 1: []
   - Agent 2: []
   - Agent 3: []

2. **Assign one item to each agent based on their highest preference:**
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (value 94)
   - Agent 1: Item 7 (value 94)
   - Agent 2: Item 8 (value 96)
   - Agent 3: Item 5 (value 78)

3. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
   - Agent 0 has one item, needs one more: Assign Item 6 (value 76)
   - Agent 1 has one item, needs one more: Assign Item 3 (value 87)
   - Agent 2 has one item, needs one more: Assign Item 2 (value 70)
   - Agent 3 has one item, needs one more: Assign Item 0 (value 26)

Now each agent has two items, except one agent who will have an extra item due to the odd total number of items.

4. **Allocate the last remaining item:**
   - Remaining item: 4
   - Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 1 (value 54), add it to Agent 1.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3, 7, 4],
    "2": [8, 2],
    "3": [5, 0]
}
```

This ensures a fair allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 9.
