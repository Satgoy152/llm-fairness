Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  51  64  93  70  71  35  32  22
1  71  40  46  19  82  11  55  90  24
2  29  45  78  71  61  78  67  15  78
3  63  35  80  84  73  55  85  22  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives. We will follow a simple greedy algorithm to allocate the items to the agents based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would receive if they were given each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's calculate the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (71).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (51).
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most (80).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (84).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (82).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (71).
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most (85).
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most (90).
- Item 8: Agent 3 values it the most (89).

Now, we ensure each agent gets at least one item and balance the allocations as much as possible.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [1, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 4, 7]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [2, 3, 6, 8]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 3, 6, 8]
}
```
