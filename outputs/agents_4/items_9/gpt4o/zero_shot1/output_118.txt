Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  86  91  68  17  31  64  24  95
1  23  50  97   8  47  20  64  24  53
2  26  28  81  93  52  13   5   3  68
3  37  22   5  90  22  51  36  96  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation. Given the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items and only 9 items are available, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness.

To do this, we can use a simple greedy algorithm where we allocate items to the agent who values them most, while keeping an eye on the distribution to ensure fairness:

1. Start by listing each item and determining which agent values each item the most.
2. Allocate the item to the agent who values it the highest, ensuring that no agent receives more than their fair share (given the number of items and agents).
3. Continue until all items are allocated.
4. If there are conflicts (e.g., an agent would receive more items than others), adjust to maintain balance.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4
- Agent 2: Items 3, 8
- Agent 3: Items 5, 6, 7

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items each agent receives while also considering their valuations.

Now, here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
