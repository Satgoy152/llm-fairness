Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  92  98  11  53  52  80  35  47
1  64  25  78  12  75  39  57  83  76
2  17  24  76  91  59  53  96  38  31
3  98  29   6   6  91  64  17  23  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's consider each agent's preferences and try to assign items in a way that balances the total value received by each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Based on the valuations, agent 0 highly values items 2, 0, and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values items 7, 8, and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values items 6, 3, and 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values items 0, 4, and 5.

Given these preferences, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 6. These are among the highest valued for agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 7 and 8. These are the highest valued items for agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 2 and 3. These items are among the highest valued for agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 4, 1, and 5. These items provide a fair balance based on agent 3's valuation.

The allocation ensures that each agent has items and all items are distributed fairly based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4, 1, 5]
}
```
