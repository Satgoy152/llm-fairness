Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  28   3  97  25  84  81  89  57
1  89  10  31  70  45  79  47  86   6
2  35  56  84  78  27   8  66  65  51
3  80  89  16  30  79  75  99  48  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that allows each agent to maximize their total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Each agent should ideally receive approximately 9/4 = 2.25, or about 2 to 3 items. 

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0: Valuation = 95
   - Item 3: Valuation = 97

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 7: Valuation = 86
   - Item 5: Valuation = 79

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 2: Valuation = 84
   - Item 6: Valuation = 66

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 1: Valuation = 89
   - Item 4: Valuation = 79
   - Item 8: Valuation = 29

Each agent receives either 2 or 3 items, and all items are allocated. The allocation is balanced in terms of the number of items per agent and considers high-value items for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 4, 8]
}
```
