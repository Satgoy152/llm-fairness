Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11   6  52  52  76  62  91   4  99
1  28  71  62  71  27  76  94  56  23
2  26  24  90  48  80  37  20  16  42
3  85  64  98  19  63  63  28  15  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can try to distribute the items based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item, ensuring each agent gets at least some items.

Let's examine the values each agent assigns to the items and attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 8 (99), Item 6 (91)
   - Allocate items 6, 8 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (94), Item 5 (76)
   - Item 6 is already allocated, so allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (90), Item 4 (80)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (98), Item 0 (85)
   - Item 2 is already allocated, so allocate Item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, 5 items have been allocated, and we have 4 remaining items (1, 3, 4, 7) to distribute among the agents. Let's continue:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest available value: Item 4 (76)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Next highest available value: Item 3 (71)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Next highest available value: Item 1 (24)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3**:
   - Next highest available value: Item 7 (15)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a share of the items, and all items are distributed. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```
