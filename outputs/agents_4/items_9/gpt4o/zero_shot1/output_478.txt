Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  26  23  94  44  87  17  10  81
1  12   1  50  69  91  17  10  44  45
2  13   1  90  96  81  17  65  80  39
3  30  12  40  94  92  15  37  25  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is balanced while ensuring all items are allocated. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, or to use a round-robin approach to ensure everyone gets a fair share.

Here is one possible allocation that attempts to balance the values:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 3 (94) and item 0 (18).
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 4 (91) and item 2 (50).
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 6 (65) and item 7 (80).
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 8 (73), item 1 (12), and item 5 (15).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items distributed is 9.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [8, 1, 5]
}
```
