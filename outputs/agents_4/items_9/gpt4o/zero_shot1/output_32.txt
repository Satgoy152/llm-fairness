Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81   8  57  52  57  89  28  40  78
1  63   2  45  72  90  64  44  23  36
2  83  23  22  96  11  29  10   7  47
3  80  93  48  73  83  33  75  32  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most, but this may not always yield a fair distribution. Instead, let's ensure each agent gets at least two items, and we distribute the remaining item based on maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0, 5
   - Values: 81 (for item 0), 89 (for item 5)

2. **Agent 1**: Items 4, 3
   - Values: 90 (for item 4), 72 (for item 3)

3. **Agent 2**: Items 2, 8
   - Values: 22 (for item 2), 47 (for item 8)

4. **Agent 3**: Items 1, 6, 7
   - Values: 93 (for item 1), 75 (for item 6), 32 (for item 7)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [1, 6, 7]
}
```
