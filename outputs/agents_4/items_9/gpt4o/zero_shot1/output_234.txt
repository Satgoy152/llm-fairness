Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  64  42  12  26  99  39  98  44
1  23   1  30  60   8  81  38  49  10
2  94  83  27  58  20  53  57  60  92
3  46  40  81  59  74  90  11  29  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that considers each agent's valuations and attempts to maximize overall satisfaction. In this context, one approach is to ensure that each agent receives some of their higher-valued items. Let's go through the process step by step.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 5 (99), Item 7 (98)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 5 (81), Item 3 (60)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 0 (94), Item 8 (92)
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: Item 5 (90), Item 2 (81)

Using the above high valuations as a guide, we can make the following allocations:

- **Agent 0** gets items 5 and 7.
- **Agent 1** gets items 3 and 6.
- **Agent 2** gets items 0 and 8.
- **Agent 3** gets items 1, 2, and 4.

These allocations ensure that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, while also balancing the total number of items allocated to each agent.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, and in total, 9 items are allocated.
