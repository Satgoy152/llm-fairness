Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  75  22  59  21   3  91  79  15
1  59  13  51   8  59  37  65  39  32
2  50  18   4  63   6  40  67  91  10
3  57   7  72  62  64  22  72   9  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. A fair allocation would try to maximize the total value each agent receives, or distribute the items such that the perceived fairness is maximized across agents.

Let's examine the valuations and distribute accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 6. 
2. **Agent 1** values items 0, 2, and 4 equally highest.
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 the highest.
4. **Agent 3** values items 2 and 6 the highest.

A potential fair allocation might be:
- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 7
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 6, 8

This allocation tries to balance the items based on the highest values each agent perceives while ensuring all items are distributed. Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [2, 6, 8]
}
```
