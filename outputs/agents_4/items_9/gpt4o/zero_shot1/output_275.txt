Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  21  28  15  87  47  47  66  74
1   2  71  30  17   1  51  42  60   7
2  20  66  20  74  25  91  96   6  53
3  30  99  63  43  45  49  17  43  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. 

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Selects the items with the highest value for them.
2. **Agent 1**: Selects the items with the highest value for them that haven't been taken.
3. **Agent 2**: Selects the items with the highest value for them that haven't been taken.
4. **Agent 3**: Selects the items with the highest value for them that haven't been taken.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 4 (87)
  - Item 8 (74)
  - Item 7 (66)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 1 (71)
  - Item 6 (42)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 5 (91)
  - Item 2 (20)

- **Agent 3**:
  - Item 3 (43)
  - Item 0 (30)

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are distributed. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```
