Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  78  94  50  56  23  28  26  36
1  57  90  43  56  91  84  76  53  65
2  46  60  65  12  32  88  27  44  52
3  47  85  32  58  85  13  66  46  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach to maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive. Let's consider each agent's preferences and distribute the items accordingly.

1. **Agent 0**: The items with the highest values for Agent 0 are item 2 (94), item 1 (78), and item 0 (76).
2. **Agent 1**: The items with the highest values for Agent 1 are item 4 (91), item 1 (90), and item 5 (84).
3. **Agent 2**: The items with the highest values for Agent 2 are item 5 (88), item 2 (65), and item 1 (60).
4. **Agent 3**: The items with the highest values for Agent 3 are item 1 (85), item 4 (85), and item 3 (58).

To ensure each agent gets a fair share, we'll aim to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is reasonably balanced, and each agent receives at least one item. We'll also ensure that no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 5
- **Agent 2**: Items 6, 7, 8
- **Agent 3**: Items 1, 3

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6, 7, 8],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
