Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  66  79  50  32   0  14   7  63
1  16  77  51  21  32  54  50  50  15
2   8  97  58   9  22  49  82  82  52
3  45  87  77  48  13  95  61  37  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize their satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Try to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their total value received while ensuring no agent receives more or less than their fair share.

Let's evaluate the total valuations:

- Agent 0: Total value = 84 + 66 + 79 + 50 + 32 + 0 + 14 + 7 + 63 = 395
- Agent 1: Total value = 16 + 77 + 51 + 21 + 32 + 54 + 50 + 50 + 15 = 366
- Agent 2: Total value = 8 + 97 + 58 + 9 + 22 + 49 + 82 + 82 + 52 = 459
- Agent 3: Total value = 45 + 87 + 77 + 48 + 13 + 95 + 61 + 37 + 46 = 509

Now, let's allocate items based on valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2] (values: 84, 79) - Total value = 163
- Agent 1: Items [1, 6] (values: 77, 50) - Total value = 127
- Agent 2: Items [7, 8] (values: 82, 52) - Total value = 134
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4, 5] (values: 48, 13, 95) - Total value = 156

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of total valuation each agent receives. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the 4 agents.
