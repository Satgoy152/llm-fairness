Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  61  64  69  48  69  37  74  18
1  32  96  64  34  42  50  56  81   8
2  61  79  86  36  31  32  51  86  10
3  36  70  88  81  32  25  72  19   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated. One common approach is to use a "greedy" allocation method where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and then we adjust to make sure each agent gets a fair share.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Assignment by Maximum Valuation**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Adjustments for Fairness**:
   - Ensure each agent gets at least 2 items since there are 4 agents and 9 items.
   - Adjust allocations to ensure no agent is left without items and the total number of items remains 9.

Let's go through the process:

### Step 1: Initial Assignment by Maximum Valuation

- Item 0: Highest value by agent 0 (82)
- Item 1: Highest value by agent 1 (96)
- Item 2: Highest value by agent 3 (88)
- Item 3: Highest value by agent 3 (81)
- Item 4: Highest value by agent 0 (48)
- Item 5: Highest value by agent 0 (69)
- Item 6: Highest value by agent 3 (72)
- Item 7: Highest value by agent 0 (74)
- Item 8: Highest value by agent 2 (10)

### Step 2: Adjustments for Fairness

- Agent 0 has 4 items (0, 4, 5, 7)
- Agent 1 has 1 item (1)
- Agent 2 has 1 item (8)
- Agent 3 has 3 items (2, 3, 6)

To ensure fairness, let's distribute the items so that each agent gets at least 2 items:

1. Move item 0 from agent 0 to agent 1 to balance item count.
2. Move item 8 from agent 2 to agent 3.

Now, the adjusted allocations are:

- Agent 0: [4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [2, 3, 6, 8]

Since agent 2 has no items and the allocation needs to be modified to include them, let's ensure fairness by reallocating the items:

1. Move item 5 from agent 0 to agent 2.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [4, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [2, 3, 6, 8]

Now, let's present the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.
