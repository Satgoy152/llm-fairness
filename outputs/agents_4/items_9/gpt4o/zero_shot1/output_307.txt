Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  13  14  66  35  83   8  16  42
1  90  99  25  45   8  39   7  11  36
2  44  81  62  65  13  25  97  53  56
3  71  68  57  11  65  70  82   9  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction or fairness in the distribution.

We can start by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing individual agent valuations:

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 82
   - Agent 1 values it at 90 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 44
   - Agent 3 values it at 71  
   **Allocate to Agent 1**

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 13
   - Agent 1 values it at 99 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 81
   - Agent 3 values it at 68  
   **Allocate to Agent 1**

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 14
   - Agent 1 values it at 25
   - Agent 2 values it at 62 (highest)
   - Agent 3 values it at 57  
   **Allocate to Agent 2**

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 66 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 45
   - Agent 2 values it at 65
   - Agent 3 values it at 11  
   **Allocate to Agent 0**

5. **Item 4**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 35
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 13
   - Agent 3 values it at 65 (highest)  
   **Allocate to Agent 3**

6. **Item 5**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 83 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 39
   - Agent 2 values it at 25
   - Agent 3 values it at 70  
   **Allocate to Agent 0**

7. **Item 6**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 8
   - Agent 1 values it at 7
   - Agent 2 values it at 97 (highest)
   - Agent 3 values it at 82  
   **Allocate to Agent 2**

8. **Item 7**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 11
   - Agent 2 values it at 53
   - Agent 3 values it at 9  
   **Allocate to Agent 2**

9. **Item 8**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 42
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Agent 2 values it at 56
   - Agent 3 values it at 75 (highest)  
   **Allocate to Agent 3**

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 6, 7],
    "3": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents.
