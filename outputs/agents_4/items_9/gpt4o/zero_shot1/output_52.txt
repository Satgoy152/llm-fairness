Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  83  24  80  57  47  78  83  92
1  77  51  43  94  41  31  94  38  76
2  35  92  69   0  29  17  50  62  98
3  10  39  91  54  45  55  49  58  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we need to ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and we maximize the total value for each agent. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- First, distribute the items based on the highest individual valuations to each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
- Next, allocate the remaining items by comparing the marginal value increase for each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 8 with a value of 92.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 3 with a value of 94.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 1 with a value of 92.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 2 with a value of 91.

Now, allocate additional items:

- **Item 0**: Best allocated to Agent 1 (77).
- **Item 4**: Best allocated to Agent 0 (57).
- **Item 5**: Best allocated to Agent 3 (55).
- **Item 6**: Best allocated to Agent 1 (94).
- **Item 7**: Best allocated to Agent 0 (83).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4, 7],
    "1": [3, 0, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all 9 items are distributed.
