Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  87  77  67  82  26  27  80  67
1  93  71  16  24  37   4  36   2  11
2  95  89  75  55   9  63  73  42  49
3  22  15  71   7  24  23   4  46  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [22 15 71  7 24 23  4 46 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. If conflicts arise (two agents value an item equally), we can resolve them by giving priority to the agent with fewer items or lower total valuation.

Let's apply this strategy:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (95).
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (89).
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (77).
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (67).
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (82).
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (63).
- Item 6: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (73).
- Item 7: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (80).
- Item 8: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (99).

Now we check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4, 7
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 5, 6
- Agent 3: Item 8

This allocation satisfies the condition that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "3": [8]
}
```
