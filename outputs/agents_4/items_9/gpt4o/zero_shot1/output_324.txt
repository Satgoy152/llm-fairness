Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  46   0  39  88  50  59  95   0
1  47  79  14  95  38   6   2  13  91
2   3  44  83   4  45   9  67  23  68
3  41  79  54  97  11  58  58  92  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Determine the total valuation each agent assigns to all items.
2. **Assign Items**: Allocate items to agents, trying to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total valuation:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 8 + 46 + 0 + 39 + 88 + 50 + 59 + 95 + 0 = 385
- Agent 1's total valuation: 47 + 79 + 14 + 95 + 38 + 6 + 2 + 13 + 91 = 385
- Agent 2's total valuation: 3 + 44 + 83 + 4 + 45 + 9 + 67 + 23 + 68 = 346
- Agent 3's total valuation: 41 + 79 + 54 + 97 + 11 + 58 + 58 + 92 + 97 = 587

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items with highest valuations first.
   - Items: [7, 4] (95 + 88 = 183)

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items with highest valuations, avoiding those already assigned.
   - Items: [3, 8] (95 + 91 = 186)

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate next highest valuations.
   - Items: [2, 6] (83 + 67 = 150)

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate remaining items.
   - Items: [1, 5, 0] (79 + 58 + 41 = 178)

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 5, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
