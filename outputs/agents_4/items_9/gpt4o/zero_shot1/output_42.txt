Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21   3  89  36  52   5  35  35  78
1  11  43  16  93  81  85  85  14  18
2  93   4  66  33  50  55  57  41  23
3  39  97  85  73  33  60  89  16  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent derives from the items they receive, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's use a simple greedy allocation strategy where we assign the highest-valued item available to the agent who values it the most, iterating until all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 89, which is the highest value for this item. Assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it at 97, which is the highest value for this item. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it at 93, which is the highest value for this item. Assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 93, which is the highest value for this item. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
5. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 35, which is the highest value for this item. Assign item 7 to agent 0.
6. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it at 89, which is the highest value for this item. Assign item 6 to agent 3.
7. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 85, which is the highest value for this item. Assign item 5 to agent 1.
8. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 81, which is the highest value for this item. Assign item 4 to agent 1.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 78, which is the highest value for this item. Assign item 8 to agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are distributed. Now, let's summarize the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 5, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 4 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
