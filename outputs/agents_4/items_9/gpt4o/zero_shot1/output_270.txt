Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  33  88  13  59  49   6  22  78
1  38  50  49  62  80   8  97  99  60
2  88  29  51  84  21  17  90  86  61
3  51  13  21  33   4  65  96  73   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 13 21 33  4 65 96 73  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a balance where each agent receives a roughly equal number of items, given there are 4 agents and 9 items. This means that most agents should receive 2 items, with one agent receiving 3 items.

Let's strategize by considering the highest valuations to maximize overall satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are items 2 (88), 0 (54), and 8 (78).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are items 7 (99), 6 (97), and 4 (80).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are items 0 (88), 3 (84), and 6 (90).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are items 6 (96), 5 (65), and 7 (73).

We need to ensure that each item is assigned to only one agent. Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 8 (Values: 88, 78)
- **Agent 1**: Items 7, 4 (Values: 99, 80)
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 3, 1 (Values: 88, 84, 29)
- **Agent 3**: Items 6, 5 (Values: 96, 65)

This allocation maximizes the total values each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [0, 3, 1],
    "3": [6, 5]
}
```
