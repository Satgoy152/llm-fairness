Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  93  10   5  55  92  32  42   0
1  27   6  80  11  36  64  20  98  77
2  70  39  68  37  87  94  68  14  65
3  87  67  86   7  86  17  25  30   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the preferences of each agent for each item. Since we want a fair allocation, we should try to allocate items to agents who value them highly while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for any item and try to allocate those items first.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while maximizing their total valuation.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5 (Values: 93, 92)
- Agent 1: Items 2, 7 (Values: 80, 98)
- Agent 2: Items 4, 8 (Values: 87, 65)
- Agent 3: Items 0, 3, 6 (Values: 87, 7, 25)

Let's check to ensure this meets all criteria:
- Each agent receives an integer number of items.
- All 9 items are allocated.
- The allocation is reasonably fair based on the given valuations.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [0, 3, 6]
}
```
