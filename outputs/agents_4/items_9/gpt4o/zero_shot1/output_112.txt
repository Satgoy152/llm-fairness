Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  56  72  65  45  59  75  29  15
1  45  45  57  28  29  32  50  20   1
2  31  51  43  26  48  84  82  22  79
3  70  72  27   2  39  34  70  94  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy approach that ensures each agent gets some items while trying to maximize the total valuation for each agent. 

We'll go through the following steps:

1. Calculate the total valuation of each item for all agents and assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

2. If some agents have no items, redistribute items to ensure each agent has at least one.

3. Ensure that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's go through this process:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (74)
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most (72)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (72)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (65)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (48)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (84)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (75)
   - Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most (94)
   - Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most (79)

2. Redistribution to ensure each agent gets at least one item:
   - Agents 0, 2, and 3 have items, but agent 1 has none.

3. Adjust allocations:
   - Move item 4 from agent 2 to agent 1, as agent 1 has no items.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 8]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 7]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
