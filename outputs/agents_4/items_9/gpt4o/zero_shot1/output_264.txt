Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  96  84  44  91  47  30  68  63
1  61  28  98  63  68  53  37  54  46
2  78  45  98  37  97  13  29  43   7
3  27  72  31  84  88  31  28   6  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible and that all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 1, 4, and 2.
- Agent 1 highly values items 2, 4, and 3.
- Agent 2 highly values items 2, 4, and 0.
- Agent 3 highly values items 3, 4, and 1.

Based on the above observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value: 96).
2. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value: 68).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value: 78).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value: 84).

Next, we can allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution:

5. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value: 98).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value: 53).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value: 30).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 3 (value: 6).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 0 (value: 63).

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 8],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
