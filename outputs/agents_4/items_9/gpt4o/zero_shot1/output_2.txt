Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  81  95  47  32  48  99  89  86
1  51  96  50  83   2  68  82  39  11
2  55  29  31  54   1   2   9  20  39
3  86  71  33   3  61  41   2  74  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider a balanced distribution based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Here is one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 99. After that, item 2 is valued at 95. Allocating these items to Agent 0 makes sense as they have high valuations for them.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 96, followed by item 3 at 83. We can allocate these items to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has lower valuations overall, but item 0 is valued relatively higher at 55. Allocating item 0 to Agent 2 is a reasonable choice.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 0 at 86, but since it's allocated to Agent 2, we look at the next highest available items. Items 4 and 8 are valued at 61 and 71 respectively. Allocating these to Agent 3 is a good option.

After these allocations, we have a few items left unallocated. We should try to ensure a fair distribution across agents while respecting their valuations. Let's allocate the remaining:

- Item 5 can go to Agent 0, who has a valuation of 48 for it.
- Item 7 can be allocated to Agent 3, who values it at 74.

Now, all items are allocated. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 8, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and considers their valuations for the items.
