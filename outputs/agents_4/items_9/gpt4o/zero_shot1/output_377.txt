Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  40  11  67  40  96  93  70  95
1  52  72  54  70  45  12  27  29  75
2  69   0  98  38  16  16  25  64   1
3  86  50  11  39  54  13  38  59  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while distributing all 9 items.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

- Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
- Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's evaluate the valuations for each item:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (86).
2. Item 1: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (72).
3. Item 2: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (98).
4. Item 3: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (67).
5. Item 4: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (40).
6. Item 5: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (96).
7. Item 6: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (93).
8. Item 7: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (70).
9. Item 8: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (95).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (since they have the highest valuations, with a tie in item 4).
- Agent 1: Item 1.
- Agent 2: Item 2.
- Agent 3: Item 0.

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation assigns each item to the agent who values it most, balancing the need to fairly distribute items among agents.
