Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0   8  97  99  48  40  67  26  27
1  11  13  15  83  94  33   0  96  32
2  54  37  20  32  18  56  36  73  23
3  15  79  99  30   4  51  32  47  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. A common approach is to ensure each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation.

Let's analyze and allocate:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 and 3. We should consider giving these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 7. These can be allocated to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has moderate valuations across the board, but notably high for item 5.
4. **Agent 3** has very high valuations for items 2 and 8, but since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we consider item 8.

Based on this initial analysis, let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3 (high valuation items)
- Agent 1: Items 4, 7 (high valuation items)
- Agent 2: Items 5, 6 (moderate-valuation items that are not highly valued by others)
- Agent 3: Items 1, 8 (high valuation items for Agent 3)
- Remaining item 0 can be allocated to Agent 2 as it has moderate value and Agent 2 has fewer items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0, 5, 6],
    "3": [1, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations and maintains a total of 9 items allocated.
