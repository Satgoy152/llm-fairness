Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  46  38   8  42  28  40   1  52
1  31  59  10  88  83  23  37  71  47
2  36  95  21  26  73  20  24  17  57
3  46  97  74  20  12  30  41  32  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items so that the overall satisfaction is balanced. Below is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and try to allocate items such that the distribution of total valuation is as fair as possible.

Here are the steps to achieve a reasonable allocation:

1. Calculate the sum of valuations for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 63 + 46 + 38 + 8 + 42 + 28 + 40 + 1 + 52 = 318
   - Agent 1: 31 + 59 + 10 + 88 + 83 + 23 + 37 + 71 + 47 = 449
   - Agent 2: 36 + 95 + 21 + 26 + 73 + 20 + 24 + 17 + 57 = 369
   - Agent 3: 46 + 97 + 74 + 20 + 12 + 30 + 41 + 32 + 46 = 398

2. Allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each gets at least one item and the distribution is fair:

- Agent 0 has high valuation for item 0 (63), allocate item 0.
- Agent 1 has high valuation for item 3 (88), allocate item 3.
- Agent 2 has high valuation for item 1 (95), allocate item 1.
- Agent 3 has high valuation for item 2 (74), allocate item 2.

Now, remaining items are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Distribute them among the agents:

- Agent 0 can also get item 8 (52).
- Agent 1 can get item 4 (83).
- Agent 2 can get item 5 (20).
- Agent 3 can get item 7 (32).
- Assign the last item, 6, to Agent 0 as it helps balance the total valuation.

3. Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures the items are distributed fairly among the agents while considering their valuations.
