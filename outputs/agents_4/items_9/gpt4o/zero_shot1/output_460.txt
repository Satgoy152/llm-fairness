Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  87  51  52  76  79  23  14  32
1  30  87  28  71  74  88  24  34  91
2  13  95  12  25  50  67  20  40  25
3  67  15  87  78  15  28  67  61  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items and use this to guide allocation decisions. 

2. Try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a relatively high total value. 

Let's look at a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items that have relatively high values for them, like items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1: Allocate items that maximize their total value, like items 1, 4, and 8.
- Agent 2: Allocate items that maximize their total value, like items 7.
- Agent 3: Allocate items that maximize their total value, like items 3 and 6.

Now, let's see the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items, and all 9 items are allocated fairly based on their valuations.
