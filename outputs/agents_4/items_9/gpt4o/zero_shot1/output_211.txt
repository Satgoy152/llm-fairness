Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  56  25  30  54  18  90   7  33
1  45  50  72  65  86   3  48   1  78
2  85  72  54  84  25  41  71   4  18
3  45  90  57  96  42  28  14  21  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value. This can be a complex optimization problem, but I'll try to provide a simple allocation that balances the total value received by each agent.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences:

- Agent 0: 79 + 56 + 25 + 30 + 54 + 18 + 90 + 7 + 33 = 392
- Agent 1: 45 + 50 + 72 + 65 + 86 + 3 + 48 + 1 + 78 = 448
- Agent 2: 85 + 72 + 54 + 84 + 25 + 41 + 71 + 4 + 18 = 454
- Agent 3: 45 + 90 + 57 + 96 + 42 + 28 + 14 + 21 + 75 = 468

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most:
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (90)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (86)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (85)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 (96)

2. Allocate remaining items considering the next highest valuations and balancing the distribution:
   - Agent 0: Add Item 0 (79)
   - Agent 1: Add Item 8 (78)
   - Agent 2: Add Item 1 (72)
   - Agent 3: Add Item 1 (90)

3. Allocate remaining items:
   - Agent 0: Add Item 5 (18)
   - Agent 3: Add Item 7 (21)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0, 5],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 1, 7]
}
```

Please note that this allocation is one of the many possible solutions and aims to balance the total value each agent receives, but the specific distribution might not perfectly optimize the fairness or total value for each agent.
