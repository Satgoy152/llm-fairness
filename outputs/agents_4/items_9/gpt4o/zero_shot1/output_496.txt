Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  99  93  73  26  45  51   7  98
1  53  64  88  17  72  53  34  29  12
2  43  82  48  14   4  49  94  20  63
3  60  92  38  38  91   6  58  74  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy such as maximizing total utility or ensuring each agent receives a fair share according to the valuations. Here, I'll attempt to balance the allocations while considering each agent's preferences. 

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations on items 1, 2, and 8.
2. Agent 1 values items 0 and 2 highly.
3. Agent 2 values items 6 and 8 highly.
4. Agent 3 values items 1 and 4 highly.

Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 2, 8]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [6, 7]
- Agent 3: [3, 4, 5]

This allocation attempts to distribute the items fairly based on the valuations and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
