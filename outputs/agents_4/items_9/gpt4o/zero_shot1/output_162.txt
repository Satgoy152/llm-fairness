Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59   5  15  50  94  72  18  87  60
1  69  69  21  51  53   7  52  13  28
2  33  77  94  58  53  63  72  39  12
3  37  52  18  19   1  22   4  93  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the allocations are as fair as possible. One common approach is to allocate items to agents who value them the most while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (94), Item 7 (87), Item 0 (59)
   - Allocate Item 4 and Item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (69), Item 1 (69), Item 3 (51)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (since Item 0 is already taken, we look for the next highest available).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (94), Item 1 (77), Item 6 (72)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (97), Item 7 (93), Item 1 (52)
   - Allocate Item 8 and Item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, let's review the unallocated items and try to distribute remaining items fairly:

- Remaining items: Item 1, Item 5, and Item 6.

5. Re-evaluate:
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (as Agent 2 values it second highest).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1.

This way, we have allocated all 9 items. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [8, 3]
}
```
