Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  70  35  56  69  72  13   9  19
1  81  37  87  50   6  93  77  31  69
2  25  31  43  22  28  76   8  68  21
3  64  40  94  83  43  82  47  44   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The allocation is based on the valuations provided by each agent for each item.

Here is one possible allocation that attempts to maximize fairness and value for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most.

After allocating these items based on the highest value each agent has for a single item, we then allocate the remaining items based on subsequent highest preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible, for fairness).

Following this strategy, a possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6
- Agent 2: Items 7, 8
- Agent 3: Items 2, 3

This ensures that each agent has received at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

Note that there can be multiple valid allocations depending on different fairness criteria and prioritization strategies. This is one such allocation based on the given values.
