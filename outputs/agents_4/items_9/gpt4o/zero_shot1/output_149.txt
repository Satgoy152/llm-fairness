Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  18  85  83  47  59  93  96  91
1  44  40  14  67   7  64  90  98   6
2  56  20  72  34  90  86  84  72  93
3  20  38  57  86  41  40  24  70  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. A common method for achieving fairness is to maximize the minimum valuation each agent receives, known as the maximin allocation. However, given the constraints and the need to allocate exactly 9 items, we also need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 6 (93), 7 (96), 8 (91)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 7 (98), 6 (90)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 4 (90), 5 (86), 8 (93)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 3 (86), 2 (57)

By focusing on each agent's highest preferences, we can try the following allocation:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation for Agent 0)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for Agent 2)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for Agent 3)

Next, distribute remaining items based on maximizing remaining valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is the JSON format for the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4, 5, 8],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are distributed.
