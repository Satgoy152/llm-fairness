Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  56  65  45  14  16  44  99   0
1  87  80  77  58  94  72  37  64   2
2  64  46  27  37  66  74  36  61  94
3  61  76  33  25  97  35   5  79  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation by each agent. This means we will assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the highest valuation for each item and assign them accordingly:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0: 20
   - Agent 1: 87
   - Agent 2: 64
   - Agent 3: 61
   - **Assign to Agent 1**
   
2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 56
   - Agent 1: 80
   - Agent 2: 46
   - Agent 3: 76
   - **Assign to Agent 1**

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 65
   - Agent 1: 77
   - Agent 2: 27
   - Agent 3: 33
   - **Assign to Agent 1**

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 45
   - Agent 1: 58
   - Agent 2: 37
   - Agent 3: 25
   - **Assign to Agent 1**

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0: 14
   - Agent 1: 94
   - Agent 2: 66
   - Agent 3: 97
   - **Assign to Agent 3**

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0: 16
   - Agent 1: 72
   - Agent 2: 74
   - Agent 3: 35
   - **Assign to Agent 2**

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0: 44
   - Agent 1: 37
   - Agent 2: 36
   - Agent 3: 5
   - **Assign to Agent 0**

8. Item 7:
   - Agent 0: 99
   - Agent 1: 64
   - Agent 2: 61
   - Agent 3: 79
   - **Assign to Agent 0**

9. Item 8:
   - Agent 0: 0
   - Agent 1: 2
   - Agent 2: 94
   - Agent 3: 98
   - **Assign to Agent 3**

Now, let's summarize the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 8]
}
```
