Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  13  86  54  50  35   4  50  51
1   5  69  63  27  17  39  67  90  83
2  32  22  93  99  34  80  20  38  96
3  32  21  53  92  82  28  31  18  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. 

Let's start by identifying which items each agent values the most and try to distribute them accordingly. 

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 2 (86), 3 (54), and 8 (51).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1's highest valuations are for items 7 (90), 8 (83), and 1 (69).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values items 3 (99), 8 (96), and 2 (93) highly.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3 (92), 4 (82), and 8 (72).

Now, we allocate based on maximizing each agent's total value:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 values it higher than others).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [3, 5, 8],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable number of items based on their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
