Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  57   7  60  51   1  42  91  78
1  75  98  99  64  10  37  88  86  50
2  14   4  82  77  97  73  39  80  72
3  28  11  79  33  24  38  98  13  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among four agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. We will try to assign items to agents such that each agent gets a similar number of items, if possible.

Let's go through a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Valuation 85 (highest for Agent 0)
   - Item 7: Valuation 91 (highest available)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2: Valuation 99 (highest for Agent 1)
   - Item 1: Valuation 98 (second highest for Agent 1)
   - Item 6: Valuation 88 (third highest for Agent 1)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4: Valuation 97 (highest for Agent 2)
   - Item 3: Valuation 77 (second highest for Agent 2)
   - Item 8: Valuation 72 (third highest for Agent 2)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 5: Valuation 38 (highest available for Agent 3)

This allocation strategy attempts to provide each agent with items they value the most while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 8],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair number of items based on their preferences.
