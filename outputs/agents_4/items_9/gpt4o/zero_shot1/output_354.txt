Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  77  73  57  51  27  37  81  59
1  17  26  89  14   7  90  64  72  30
2  30  68  11  71  51  53  92  68  66
3  35   0  16  46  47  31  64  21  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. One way to approach this problem is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 7. We assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 highly. We assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 6 and 3. We assign item 6 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 8 the most. We assign item 8 to agent 3.

Now, each agent has one item, and we still need to allocate 5 more items. Let's distribute them to maximize the total valuation:

5. Agent 0 can also benefit from items 1 and 7. We assign items 1 and 7 to agent 0.
6. Agent 1 has high valuation for item 2. We assign item 2 to agent 1.
7. Agent 2 can benefit from item 4. We assign item 4 to agent 2.
8. Agent 3 can receive item 3. Assign item 3 to agent 3.

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed fairly among the agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on the given valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3, 8]
}
```
