Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  41  77  41  11  13  56  39  12
1   5  38  20  47  51  77  90  22  36
2   5  81  68  25  34   6  89  41  60
3  25  92  22  84  86  20  13  79  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we need to balance the total value or utility each agent receives. We can attempt to allocate items in a way that each agent gets a similar total value or number of high-value items based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation of items to agents:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items with relatively higher value for this agent.
   - Items allocated: [0, 7]
   - Total value: 30 (item 0) + 39 (item 7) = 69

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items with relatively higher value for this agent.
   - Items allocated: [4, 5, 6]
   - Total value: 51 (item 4) + 77 (item 5) + 90 (item 6) = 218

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items with relatively higher value for this agent.
   - Items allocated: [1, 2]
   - Total value: 81 (item 1) + 68 (item 2) = 149

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items with relatively higher value for this agent.
   - Items allocated: [3, 8]
   - Total value: 84 (item 3) + 10 (item 8) = 94

This allocation provides a reasonable balance based on the valuations provided. The allocations can be adjusted further if needed, but this serves as a fair starting point.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3, 8]
}
```
