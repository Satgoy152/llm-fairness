Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  32   3  22  97  85  37  22  86
1  83  23  70  69  39  35  68  35  76
2  90  20  61  62  26   1  41  22  91
3  57  31  32  84   6  29  76   7  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the most, followed by item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a high valuation for item 0 and item 8.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 the most.

By aiming to maximize the total value for each agent and ensuring that the allocation is fair, we can assign items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 8
- **Agent 3**: Items 1, 6, 7

Finally, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [1, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items, while also attempting to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible.
