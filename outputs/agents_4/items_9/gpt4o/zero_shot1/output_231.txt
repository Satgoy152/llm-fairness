Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  58  46  93  79  17   2  96  87
1  57   9  80  40   3  51  30  68   3
2  68  21  79  28  44  26  54  84  47
3   8  32  59  38  55  48  66  92  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Look at the highest valuation for each agent and allocate that item if it hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Try to balance the number of items each agent gets as much as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 6, 8
- Agent 3: Items 1, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items closest to their highest preferences while distributing all 9 items. Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
