Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  97  72  23  29  56  14  31  38
1  83  58  68   0  26  40  94  41  90
2  15  64  43   8  85  49  25  64  33
3  73  83  25  42  33  22  30  61  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. A common approach is to use a greedy method by iterating through each item and assigning it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 83. Assign to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 97. Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 72. Assign to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 42. Assign to Agent 3.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 85. Assign to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 56. Assign to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 94. Assign to Agent 1.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 41. Assign to Agent 1.

9. **Item 8**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 90. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 6, 7, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
