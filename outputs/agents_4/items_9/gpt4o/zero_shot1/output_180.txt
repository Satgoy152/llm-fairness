Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  78  50  62  26  51  79  11   5
1  68  73  18  46  44  79  30  43  36
2   2  52  68  74  46  17  30  11  68
3  83  22  56  92  28  35  62  81  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while also distributing the total number of items fairly. Since we have 9 items and 4 agents, one possible approach is to allocate 2 items to two of the agents and 3 items to the other two agents.

Let's analyze the values and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 6 (79), Item 1 (78), Item 3 (62)
   - Allocate: Items 1 and 6

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (79), Item 0 (68), Item 1 (73)
   - Allocate: Items 0 and 5

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (74), Item 2 (68), Item 8 (68)
   - Allocate: Items 2 and 3

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (92), Item 0 (83), Item 7 (81)
   - Allocate: Items 4, 7, and 8

Let's check the allocation:
- Agent 0 gets Items 1 and 6
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 5
- Agent 2 gets Items 2 and 3
- Agent 3 gets Items 4, 7, and 8

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4, 7, 8]
}
```
