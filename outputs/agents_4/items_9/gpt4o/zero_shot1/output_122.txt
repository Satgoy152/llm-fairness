Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27   8  62  55  47  34  13   4  51
1  70  76  90  73  40  79  76   5  96
2   3   0  10  90  86  77  96  19  94
3  38  50  12  98  62  39   9  26  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 3 items, and the other three agents will receive 2 items each.

Let's evaluate the highest value items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - 2: 62
  - 3: 55
  - 8: 51

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - 8: 96
  - 2: 90
  - 5: 79

- Agent 2 values the items as follows:
  - 6: 96
  - 3: 90
  - 8: 94

- Agent 3 values the items as follows:
  - 3: 98
  - 4: 62
  - 1: 50

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Agent 0 gets items [2, 8]
2. Agent 1 gets items [5, 1]
3. Agent 2 gets items [6, 3]
4. Agent 3 gets items [4, 0]

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [4, 0]
}
```
