Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  30  15  27   0  32  55  55  58
1  56   8  84  63  46  33  92  30   8
2  76  90  81  42  99  99  46  26  76
3  84  31  60  30  55  15  92  73  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for the items. A fair allocation should aim to maximize overall satisfaction based on the given valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and the total number of items allocated equals the number of items available.

Here are the steps for allocation:

1. **Assign the highest valued items to each agent:**
   - Identify the highest valued items for each agent and allocate one item to each agent based on their highest valuation.

2. **Distribute remaining items:**
   - After each agent has received their highest valued item, distribute the remaining items to maximize total satisfaction, considering the second-highest valuations and so on.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated:**
   - Make sure that all 9 items are allocated among the agents.

Let's perform this allocation:

1. Agent 0: Highest value is 58 for item 8. Allocate item 8.
2. Agent 1: Highest value is 92 for item 6. Allocate item 6.
3. Agent 2: Highest value is 99 for items 4 and 5. Allocate item 4.
4. Agent 3: Highest value is 92 for item 6 (already taken). Next highest is 84 for item 0. Allocate item 0.

Remaining items to allocate: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.

5. Agent 0: Next highest value is 55 for item 7. Allocate item 7.
6. Agent 1: Next highest value is 84 for item 2. Allocate item 2.
7. Agent 2: Next highest value is 99 for item 5. Allocate item 5.
8. Agent 3: Next highest value is 73 for item 7 (already taken). Next is 60 for item 2 (already taken). Next is 55 for item 4 (already taken). Next is 31 for item 1. Allocate item 1.

Remaining item: 3.

9. Agent 0: Next highest value is 32 for item 5 (already taken). Next is 31 for item 0 (already taken). Next is 30 for item 1 (already taken). Finally, 27 for item 3. Allocate item 3.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 7, 3],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated among the agents.
