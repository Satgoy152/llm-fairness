Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  52  80  93  92  90  39  10  20
1  36  15  57  63  67  55  53  14  83
2   7   2  71  39  11  53   8  22  30
3  82  10  30  44  22  88  94   2  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. One way to achieve this is by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest at 93.
- **Agent 1** values item 8 the highest at 83.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest at 71.
- **Agent 3** values item 6 the highest at 94.

We will start by assigning these highest valued items to each agent. Then, we will allocate the remaining items by considering second highest values while ensuring all items are distributed.

1. **Assign highest valued items:**
   - Agent 0: Item 3
   - Agent 1: Item 8
   - Agent 2: Item 2
   - Agent 3: Item 6

2. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Agent 0: Next highest is item 4 valued at 92
   - Agent 1: Next highest is item 3 (already taken) so next is item 4 valued at 67 (already taken) so next is item 5 valued at 55
   - Agent 2: Next highest is item 5 valued at 53 (already taken) so item 7 valued at 22
   - Agent 3: Next highest is item 0 valued at 82

3. **Remaining items:**
   - Items 1 and 0 are left unallocated.
   - Agent 0: Next highest is item 1 valued at 52
   - Agent 3: Assign item 0 to complete allocation

Now all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 1],
    "1": [8, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [6, 0]
}
```
