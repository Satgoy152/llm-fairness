Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  31  80  34  68  18  73  72  45
1  26  59  66   9  39  86  48  32  74
2  49  10  40  53  69  80  10  82  27
3   4  55  71  50  48  44   9  84  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation, taking into account the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0**: We will assign items that Agent 0 values highly.
2. **Agent 1**: We will assign items that Agent 1 values highly.
3. **Agent 2**: We will assign items that Agent 2 values highly.
4. **Agent 3**: We will assign items that Agent 3 values highly.

Let's determine a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0, 2 (values: 61, 80)
- Agent 1: Assign items 1, 5 (values: 59, 86)
- Agent 2: Assign items 4, 7 (values: 69, 82)
- Agent 3: Assign items 3, 6, 8 (values: 50, 9, 72)

This allocation considers a balanced distribution based on high-value items for each agent while ensuring all items are assigned.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [3, 6, 8]
}
```
