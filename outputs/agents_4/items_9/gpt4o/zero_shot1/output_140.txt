Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  40  13  86  20  35  93  15  77
1  90  26  65  12  46  27  30  28  20
2  10  13  12  43   0  73   1  72  51
3  59  67  83  83   2  14   4  88  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing each agent's satisfaction and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a simple method that suits the given problem. Below is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritizes items with high values, such as items 6, 3, and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for items 0, 2, and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Values items 5 and 7 highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a balanced valuation across items, but can get item 1 which no one highly values and item 7.

Here's how the allocation could be distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6, 3, 8
- **Agent 1**: Item 0, 2, 4
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 1, 7

Now, presenting the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
