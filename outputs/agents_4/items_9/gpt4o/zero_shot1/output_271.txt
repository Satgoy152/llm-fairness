Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  22  61  47  39  21  63  57  50
1  93  25  95  34  21  55   6  39  25
2  59   1  54  14  98  86  16  26   6
3  49  34  73  99  47  56  20  42  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while taking into account their valuations, we can use a strategy to maximize the overall valuations for each agent. This means assigning items to agents based on who values them most.

Here’s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Highest valued items: 6 (63), 8 (50), 2 (61)
    - Allocate items [2, 6, 8]

2. **Agent 1**: 
    - Highest valued items: 2 (95), 0 (93), 5 (55)
    - Allocate items [0, 2, 5]

3. **Agent 2**: 
    - Highest valued items: 4 (98), 5 (86), 0 (59)
    - Allocate items [4, 5]

4. **Agent 3**: 
    - Highest valued items: 3 (99), 2 (73), 1 (34)
    - Allocate item [3]

To ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we need to optimize the allocation further while ensuring fairness. We will distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets at least one item.

Revised allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [6] — Highest value for item 6
- **Agent 1**: [0, 2] — High values for items 0 and 2
- **Agent 2**: [4, 5] — High values for items 4 and 5
- **Agent 3**: [1, 3, 7, 8] — Remaining items optimized by preference

This ensures that each agent receives a fair allocation based on their preferences and all items are distributed.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
