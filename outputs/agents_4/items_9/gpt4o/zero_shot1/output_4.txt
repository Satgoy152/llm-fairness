Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  84  74  44  28   8  14  97  97
1  49  41  33  62   4  79  93  50  78
2  36  64  72  48  93   4  50  96  64
3  12  34  11  84  12  79  83   1  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value. Here is one way to allocate the items considering these factors:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values items 1, 7, and 8 highly. Allocating items 1 and 7 to Agent 0 would give them a high total valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values items 6 and 5 highly. Allocating these items would give them a good total valuation.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values items 4 and 7 highly. Since item 7 is already allocated, we'll assign item 4 to Agent 2. They also have a relatively high valuation for item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 highly. Allocating item 3 to Agent 3 would be most beneficial.

Now let's assign the items:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items [1, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Gets items [5, 6]
- **Agent 2**: Gets items [2, 4]
- **Agent 3**: Gets item [3]

Now all items need to be accounted for, so let's allocate the remaining item 0 to Agent 2 as they have the next highest valuation among unallocated items.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value based on their preferences.
