Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  29  12  11  11  39  96  75  93
1  16  40  93  33  45   6  64   0  14
2  17  12  16   8  28  20  56  12   5
3  75   6  41  35   1  31  17  89  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total value for each agent, we can use a strategy that considers the highest value each agent gives to an item. We'll ensure each agent receives at least one item, and distribute the remaining items in a way that attempts to maximize their individual valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 6 the most at 96. We assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 93. We assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 the most, but since it's already taken, we look at the next highest value, which is item 0 at 17. Assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 0 the most, but since it's already taken, we look at the next highest value, which is item 7 at 89. Assign item 7 to agent 3.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items based on the highest remaining values for each agent:

5. **Remaining items**: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8.

- Agent 0 has the next highest value for item 8 at 93, so assign item 8 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 40, which is the highest available value for agent 1. Assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 at 28. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 at 35. Assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Finally, item 5 has to be assigned. Agent 0 values it at 39, agent 1 at 6, agent 2 at 20, and agent 3 at 31. The highest remaining value is from agent 0. Assign item 5 to agent 0.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 4 agents, trying to maximize the value each agent receives based on their highest preferences.
