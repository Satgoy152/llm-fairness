Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  31  70  74  70  85  26  59  43
1  50  31  99  57  66  62  27  23  97
2  89  64  98  13  45  56  72  20  91
3  49  97  40  10  46  77  21  74  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations such that each agent's overall satisfaction is maximized while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and exactly 9 items are distributed in total. 

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that have relatively high values compared to others. 
    - Item 0: Valuation = 73
    - Item 3: Valuation = 74

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items where agent 1 has particularly high valuations.
    - Item 2: Valuation = 99
    - Item 8: Valuation = 97

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items where agent 2 values are relatively higher.
    - Item 4: Valuation = 45
    - Item 6: Valuation = 72

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that have relatively high values for agent 3.
    - Item 1: Valuation = 97
    - Item 5: Valuation = 77
    - Item 7: Valuation = 74

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1, 5, 7]
}
```
