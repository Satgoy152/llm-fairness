Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  78  26   2  12  56  15  56  32
1  40  48  91  70  62  27  99  38  41
2  60  17  94  83  27  53  98  17   7
3  41  52  62  91  37  21  80  54  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation of each item and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Given there are 4 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate total valuation for each agent**: This helps in understanding which agent values the items more in total, which can be a factor in fairness.

2. **Assign items based on highest valuation**: Start by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring each agent ends up with at least 2 items.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (82)
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (78)
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (94)
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by agent 3 (91)
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by agent 1 (62)
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (56)
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (98)
- **Item 7**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (56)
- **Item 8**: Highest valuation by agent 3 (57)

Now, adjusting to ensure each agent gets at least 2 items:

- **Agent 0** gets items [0, 1, 5, 7]
- **Agent 1** gets items [4]
- **Agent 2** gets items [2, 6]
- **Agent 3** gets items [3, 8]

To make sure each agent gets at least 2 items:

- Reassign item 1 to agent 1
- Reassign item 4 to agent 1

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items [0, 5, 7]
- **Agent 1** gets items [1, 4]
- **Agent 2** gets items [2, 6]
- **Agent 3** gets items [3, 8]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 8]
}
```
