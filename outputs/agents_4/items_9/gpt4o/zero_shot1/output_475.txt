Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  82   4  16  72  16  43  87  85
1  39   3  35  74  33  26  44  96  68
2  10  31  79  74  54  11  91  34  92
3  85  92  22  63  30  52  95  67  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a potential allocation that considers the agents' preferences:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign items 1, 7, and 8. These items have high valuations for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign items 3 and 5. These have relatively higher valuations for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign items 2 and 6. These items have notably high valuations for Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Assign items 0 and 4. Agent 3 values these items highly.

With this allocation, each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and the allocation respects the agents' preferences based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
