Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  67  25  14  84  53  90  19   7
1  90  91  83   8  16  59  19  88  62
2  20  87  77  40  28  79  82  27  20
3  90  13  70  15  20  59  75  81  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44 67 25 14 84 53 90 19  7]
 [90 91 83  8 16 59 19 88 62]

 [90 13 70 15 20 59 75 81 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and each agent is assigned an integer number of items. Here's a potential approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized.

Given the valuation table:

```
Agent 0: 44, 67, 25, 14, 84, 53, 90, 19,  7
Agent 1: 90, 91, 83,  8, 16, 59, 19, 88, 62
Agent 2: 20, 87, 77, 40, 28, 79, 82, 27, 20
Agent 3: 90, 13, 70, 15, 20, 59, 75, 81, 36
```

Let's compute the total valuation for each agent and allocate the items:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation
- Agent 0: 403
- Agent 1: 516
- Agent 2: 460
- Agent 3: 459

### Step 2: Allocate Items
Allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 4] (values: 90, 84)
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1] (values: 90, 91)
- Agent 2: Items [5, 2] (values: 79, 77)
- Agent 3: Items [7, 3, 8] (values: 81, 15, 36)

### Final Allocation in JSON
```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [7, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
