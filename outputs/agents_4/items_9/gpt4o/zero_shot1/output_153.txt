Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  69  70  77   3  80  85  65  70
1  56  15  77  81  19   1   5   2   8
2  97   5  94  93   3  34  71   4  78
3  97  46  76  37  59  45  93  97  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a method that can balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate the items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will end up with 3 items, and three agents will end up with 2 items each.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Highest value by Agent 2: 97
   - Allocate to Agent 2

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest value by Agent 0: 69
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value by Agent 2: 94
   - Allocate to Agent 2

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value by Agent 1: 81
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value by Agent 3: 59
   - Allocate to Agent 3

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest value by Agent 0: 80
   - Allocate to Agent 0

7. **Item 6**:
   - Highest value by Agent 3: 93
   - Allocate to Agent 3

8. **Item 7**:
   - Highest value by Agent 3: 97
   - Allocate to Agent 3

9. **Item 8**:
   - Highest value by Agent 2: 78
   - Allocate to Agent 2

Now, check the allocation to ensure fairness:
- Agent 0: 2 items
- Agent 1: 1 item
- Agent 2: 3 items
- Agent 3: 3 items

To adjust fairness, re-evaluate Agent 1's allocation:

- Reallocate Item 0 to Agent 1, which gives Agent 1 2 items, and Agent 2 2 items.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: 2 items
- Agent 1: 2 items
- Agent 2: 2 items
- Agent 3: 3 items

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least 2 items, with one agent receiving 3 due to the total number of items needing to sum to 9.
