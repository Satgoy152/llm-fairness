Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  24  84  70   5  49  68  12  36
1  59  36  95  63   2  26  31  24  38
2   0  17  84  90  65  12  37  77   1
3  83  66  48  69  30  76  31  30  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly and that aren't highly valued by others.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly and that aren't highly valued by others.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly and that aren't highly valued by others.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that Agent 3 values highly and that aren't highly valued by others.

Let's check the valuations for each agent and allocate accordingly:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest values: Item 2 (84), Item 3 (70), Item 6 (68)
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Highest values: Item 2 (95), Item 3 (63)
- **Agent 2**: 
  - Highest values: Item 3 (90), Item 7 (77), Item 4 (65)
- **Agent 3**: 
  - Highest values: Item 0 (83), Item 5 (76)

Allocating based on high valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2, Item 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 3
- **Agent 2**: Item 7, Item 4
- **Agent 3**: Item 0, Item 5

This leaves Items 1 and 8 unallocated. We need to assign these items to ensure all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0** could take Item 1 (24)
- **Agent 1** could take Item 8 (38)

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 1],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a number of items based on their valuations.
