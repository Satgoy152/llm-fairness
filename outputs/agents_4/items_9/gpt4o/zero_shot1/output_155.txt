Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  18  15  35  73  16  20  89  71
1  41  66  44  87  81  10  46  44  89
2  38   4  25   9  62  23  33   2  41
3  58  75  30  75  42  17  96  15  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach by considering each agent's highest-valued items first, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 7 (value 89)
   - Allocate: Item 7

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 8 (value 89)
   - Allocate: Item 8

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (value 62)
   - Allocate: Item 4

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value: Item 6 (value 96)
   - Allocate: Item 6

Now, each agent has one item. Allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest-valued items for each agent, while ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent.

5. **Remaining Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Next highest value is Item 4 (already taken), then Item 0 (65)
   - Allocate: Item 0
   - Agent 1: Next highest value is Item 3 (87)
   - Allocate: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Next highest value is Item 8 (already taken), then Item 6 (already taken), then Item 0 (38)
   - Allocate: Item 0 (already taken), then Item 2 (25)
   - Agent 3: Next highest value is Item 1 (75) and Item 3 (already taken)
   - Allocate: Item 1

Now, check remaining items: 2, 5, and 8.
- Agent 0: Item 5 (16)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (44)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (23)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (30)

Final allocation:
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 8, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a set of items, and all items are allocated.
