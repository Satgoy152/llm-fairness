Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  96  80  21   6  83  57  86  92
1  77  79  72  39  90   4   8  92  72
2  54  79  50  55  25  68  81  21  84
3  45  77  25  20  84  89  62  94  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value that each agent receives. One approach is to use a round-robin assignment based on the highest value each agent places on the remaining unallocated items. This ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, while distributing the items fairly.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Initialize an empty allocation for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: []
   - Agent 1: []
   - Agent 2: []
   - Agent 3: []

2. **Create a list of all items that need to be allocated:**
   - Items to allocate: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

3. **Allocate items one at a time to each agent in a round-robin fashion based on the highest remaining value:**

   - **Round 1:**
     - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 96)
     - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 90)
     - Agent 2 picks item 8 (value 84)
     - Agent 3 picks item 7 (value 94)

   - **Round 2:**
     - Agent 0 picks item 8 (value 92)
     - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 92)
     - Agent 2 picks item 6 (value 81)
     - Agent 3 picks item 5 (value 89)

   - **Round 3:**
     - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 80)
     - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 77)
     - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 79)
     - Agent 3 picks item 4 (value 84)

4. **Check the allocation:**
   - Ensure that each agent has received items and that exactly 9 items have been allocated.

5. **Finalize the allocation in the requested JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8, 2],
    "1": [4, 7, 0],
    "2": [8, 6, 1],
    "3": [7, 5, 4]
}
```

Note that due to the nature of the problem, there could be multiple valid solutions. The key is to ensure that all agents receive items fairly based on their valuations.
