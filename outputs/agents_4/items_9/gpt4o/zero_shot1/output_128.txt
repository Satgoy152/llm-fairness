Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  56  25  55  62  74  41  71  36
1   3  51  28   1  85  64  60  13  95
2  85  48  10  90   8  27  40  70  18
3  70   4  54  94  82   6  55  56  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and exactly 9 items are allocated in total.

Let's approach the allocation by evaluating the valuations provided by each agent for the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations: 
   - High valuations: Item 5 (74), Item 4 (62), Item 7 (71).
   - Medium valuations: Item 3 (55), Item 1 (56).

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations:
   - High valuations: Item 8 (95), Item 4 (85).
   - Medium valuations: Item 6 (60), Item 5 (64).

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations:
   - High valuations: Item 3 (90), Item 0 (85).
   - Medium valuations: Item 7 (70).

4. **Agent 3** has high valuations:
   - High valuations: Item 3 (94).
   - Medium valuations: Item 0 (70), Item 4 (82).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** gets high valued Item 5 and medium valued Item 1.
- **Agent 1** gets high valued Item 8 and medium valued Item 6.
- **Agent 2** gets high valued Item 3 and medium valued Item 7.
- **Agent 3** gets high valued Item 0 and medium valued Item 4.

Now we have allocated 8 items. We have one remaining item, Item 2, which we can allocate to any agent who has not received a third item. Let's allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, who has a medium valuation for it.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 2],
    "1": [8, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

With this allocation, each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
