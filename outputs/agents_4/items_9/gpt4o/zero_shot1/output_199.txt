Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  11  98  55  95  20  12  89  77
1  58  32  37  99  72   0  66  15  11
2  30  34  76  97  44   1  34  16  35
3  28  22  83  94  23  92  19  44  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the perceived value for each agent. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated in total.

One approach is to use a method similar to the "round-robin" allocation process, where each agent takes turns choosing the item they value the most among the remaining unallocated items. However, due to the complexity in ensuring fairness and optimality, a simple heuristic approach will be applied here.

Here’s one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on high-value items for Agent 0. They value item 2 highly.
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 3 very highly.
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 3 highly, but since it’s taken, we look at the next highest which is item 2, but also taken, so we go down the list.
4. **Agent 3**: They value item 5 highly.

Let's proceed with a heuristic allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 2, 0
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 3, 8
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 6, 4
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 5, 7, 1

This way, all items are allocated, and each agent gets a reasonable value. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [5, 7, 1]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent gets items and all 9 items are allocated.
