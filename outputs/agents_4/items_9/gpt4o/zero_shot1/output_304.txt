Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  25  25  13  94  13  87   6  22
1  72   7  19  45  55  53  49  79  98
2  74  49  34  87  39  41  63  60  19
3  39  37  74  15  26  68  22  65  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both the total valuation each agent has for the items and ensure each agent receives a reasonable share of items. Here's a potential approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items.
2. Try to allocate items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 89 + 25 + 25 + 13 + 94 + 13 + 87 + 6 + 22 = 374
- Agent 1: 72 + 7 + 19 + 45 + 55 + 53 + 49 + 79 + 98 = 477
- Agent 2: 74 + 49 + 34 + 87 + 39 + 41 + 63 + 60 + 19 = 466
- Agent 3: 39 + 37 + 74 + 15 + 26 + 68 + 22 + 65 + 32 = 378

Next, let's allocate the items to each agent by selecting the highest-value items for each agent. We aim to distribute as evenly as possible, considering each agent's preferences.

Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 4] (Values: 89, 94)
- Agent 1: [8, 7] (Values: 98, 79)
- Agent 2: [3, 2, 6] (Values: 87, 34, 63)
- Agent 3: [5, 1] (Values: 68, 37)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [8, 7],
    "2": [3, 2, 6],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences and the total number of items allocated is 9.
