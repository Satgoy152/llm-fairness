Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31   1  74  56  71  39  27  97   6
1  69  35  66  56  52  17  65  16  38
2  11  96  99  22  62  26  37  74  35
3  16  41  37  46  54  64  66  90  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. We'll aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is reasonably balanced and considers their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations provided:

- Agent 0:
  - High valuations: Item 2 (74), Item 4 (71), Item 7 (97)
- Agent 1:
  - High valuations: Item 0 (69), Item 2 (66), Item 6 (65)
- Agent 2:
  - High valuations: Item 1 (96), Item 2 (99), Item 7 (74)
- Agent 3:
  - High valuations: Item 7 (90), Item 5 (64), Item 8 (60)

Considering these preferences, we'll try to allocate the items to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 3: Items [4, 5, 8]

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect the agents' higher valuations and distribute the items fairly across all agents.
