Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86   1   6   0  43  70  21  85   3
1  14  69  31  55  29  29  15   3  89
2   0  61   1  59  95   9  13  20  45
3  11  92  87  17  65  81  97  62  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86  1  6  0 43 70 21 85  3]
 [14 69 31 55 29 29 15  3 89]
 [ 0 61  1 59 95  9 13 20 45]
 [11 92 87 17 65 81 97 62 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. A common approach is to try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by assigning items based on their preferences while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Given the table, let's try a simple allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the highest (86), so we will allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 8 the highest (89), so we will allocate item 8 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest (95), so we will allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 the highest (97), so we will allocate item 6 to agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items while trying to balance the number of items each agent receives:

- **Remaining items**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7

Continuing with the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 0. Next highest available is item 7 (85).
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 8. Next highest available is item 1 (69).
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 4. Next highest available is item 3 (59).
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 6. Next highest available is item 5 (81).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [8, 1],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [6, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their highest valuations, considering we have 9 items and 4 agents.
