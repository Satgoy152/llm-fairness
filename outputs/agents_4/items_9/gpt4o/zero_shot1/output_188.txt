Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  92  88  63  84  35  10  31  61
1  96  88  92  16  53  20  24  80  69
2  81  76  61  22  38  13  97   9  86
3   8  14  41  42  22  63  99  65  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 4 agents based on the valuation table, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 4 agents and 9 items, one strategy is to allocate 2 items to three agents and 3 items to one agent, or 2 items to two agents and 2 items to the remaining two agents.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that attempts to maximize the value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Items 1 (92), 2 (88), and 4 (84).
   - Allocate: Items 1 and 2.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Items 0 (96), 2 (92), and 7 (80).
   - Allocate: Items 0 and 7.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Items 6 (97), 8 (86), and 0 (81).
   - Allocate: Items 6 and 8.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Remaining items: 3, 4, 5.
   - Highest values: Item 5 (63).
   - Allocate: Items 3, 4, and 5.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent getting a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
