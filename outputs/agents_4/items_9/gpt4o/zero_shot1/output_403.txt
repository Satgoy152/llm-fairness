Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  17  56  93  99  71  76   1  32
1  40  49  39  95  41  92  58  60  42
2  44  66  89  49  29  78  18  93  67
3  15  82  83  59  20  58  96  73  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a relatively equal share of the total value of the items, while also considering individual valuations for each item. A common approach to achieve this is by using a method known as the "envy-free" allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Try to assign items such that each agent's allocated items' total value is as balanced as possible.

Let's do the allocation:

- Agent 0 values: [90, 17, 56, 93, 99, 71, 76, 1, 32]
- Agent 1 values: [40, 49, 39, 95, 41, 92, 58, 60, 42]
- Agent 2 values: [44, 66, 89, 49, 29, 78, 18, 93, 67]
- Agent 3 values: [15, 82, 83, 59, 20, 58, 96, 73, 94]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 4] 
  (Items 0 and 4 have high values of 90 and 99 for Agent 0, totaling 189)
  
- Agent 1: [3, 5] 
  (Items 3 and 5 have high values of 95 and 92 for Agent 1, totaling 187)

- Agent 2: [2, 7] 
  (Items 2 and 7 have high values of 89 and 93 for Agent 2, totaling 182)

- Agent 3: [6, 8, 1] 
  (Items 6, 8, and 1 have values of 96, 94, and 82 for Agent 3, totaling 272)

This allocation covers all 9 items while attempting to balance the total perceived value each agent receives.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [6, 8, 1]
}
```
