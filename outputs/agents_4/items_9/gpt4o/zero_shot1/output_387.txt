Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  26  98  96  84  60  71  48  12
1   6  99  48   2  41  62  52  75  94
2  81  22   8   7  14  43  76  41  31
3   3  40  86  40  29  13  62  99  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2: Value 98
   - Item 3: Value 96
   - Total value for Agent 0: 194

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1: Value 99
   - Item 8: Value 94
   - Total value for Agent 1: 193

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0: Value 81
   - Item 6: Value 76
   - Total value for Agent 2: 157

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 7: Value 99
   - Item 5: Value 13
   - Item 4: Value 29
   - Total value for Agent 3: 141

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [7, 5, 4]
}
```
