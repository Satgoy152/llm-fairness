Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  43  97  76  81  33  92  59  11
1  96  45  78  35   5  39  25  37  78
2  16  33  88  70   2  46  23  94  71
3  22  18  24  25  49  68  92  65  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute items in a way that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value. Given the valuations, a straightforward approach is to assign items by selecting the highest valued item for each agent until all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 97).
   - Next highest is item 6 (value 92).
   - Next highest is item 4 (value 81).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 96).
   - Next highest is item 8 (value 78).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 7 (value 94).
   - Next highest is item 2 (value 88), but already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next highest is item 8 (value 71), but already allocated to Agent 1.
   - Next highest is item 3 (value 70).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 6 (value 92), but already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next highest is item 5 (value 68).
   - Next highest is item 4 (value 49), but already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next highest is item 7 (value 65), but already allocated to Agent 2.
   - Next highest is item 3 (value 25), but already allocated to Agent 2.
   - The next highest available is item 1 (value 18).

Following this approach, let's ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent gets a reasonable allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 6, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 8]
- Agent 2: [7, 3]
- Agent 3: [5, 1]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 4],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```
