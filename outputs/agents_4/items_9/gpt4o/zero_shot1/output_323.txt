Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77   7  39  72  39  40  27  15  78
1  97  47  74  53  99  90  99  24  93
2  90  13  99  45  94  22  68  66  75
3  62  96  61  94  44  56   6  95  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. One common approach is to consider each agent's preference for items and try to distribute them to balance the overall value received by each agent.

Here's one possible allocation that aims to fairly distribute the items among the agents:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they got all items to get an idea of their preferences.

2. Allocate items to each agent to try to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value from item 8 (78) and item 0 (77).
- Agent 1: Highest value from item 4 (99) and item 6 (99).
- Agent 2: Highest value from item 2 (99) and item 4 (94).
- Agent 3: Highest value from item 1 (96).

This gives us:

- Agent 0: [8, 0]
- Agent 1: [4, 6]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [1]

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items.

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (value 94).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 90).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (value 66).

This results in the following allocation, which balances the total values received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [4, 6, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the 4 agents.
