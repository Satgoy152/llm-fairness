Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  72  85  36  47  12   6  32  83
1   6  18   8  14  93  97  40  27  20
2  66  53  50  38  39  61  76  65  38
3   9  54  24  93  74  88  77  21  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to distribute the total value of items as evenly as possible among the agents. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Try to distribute items such that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: \(4 + 72 + 85 + 36 + 47 + 12 + 6 + 32 + 83 = 377\)
- Agent 1: \(6 + 18 + 8 + 14 + 93 + 97 + 40 + 27 + 20 = 323\)
- Agent 2: \(66 + 53 + 50 + 38 + 39 + 61 + 76 + 65 + 38 = 486\)
- Agent 3: \(9 + 54 + 24 + 93 + 74 + 88 + 77 + 21 + 78 = 518\)

Now, we can aim to allocate items to balance these totals as much as possible:

1. Assign high-value items to agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value.

Here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 8] (Total value = 72 + 83 = 155)
- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 5] (Total value = 93 + 97 = 190)
- **Agent 2**: Items [6, 7] (Total value = 76 + 65 = 141)
- **Agent 3**: Items [0, 2, 3] (Total value = 9 + 24 + 93 = 126)

In JSON format, this allocation is represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the value of items each agent receives, taking into account their individual valuations.
