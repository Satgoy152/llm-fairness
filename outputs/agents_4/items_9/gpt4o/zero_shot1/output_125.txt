Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44   4   1   7  31  13   4  42  90
1  52  43  15  68  97  41   5  96   1
2  89  89  88  36  42  46  32  76  15
3  87  16  89  46  40   3  45  68  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize each agent's total valuation, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking for high valuations, we see item 8 has a valuation of 90. This is the highest available valuation for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for agent 1 is item 4 with a valuation of 97.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations for agent 2 are items 0 and 1, both with a valuation of 89. Allocating item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for agent 3 is item 2 with a valuation of 89.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 3, 5, 6, 7) while considering the remaining highest valuations:

5. **Agent 2**: Allocating item 1 (89), as it is still available and has the highest valuation.
6. **Agent 1**: Allocating item 3 (68), as it is available and has a high valuation.
7. **Agent 3**: Allocating item 7 (68), as it is available and tied for the highest remaining valuation.
8. **Agent 2**: Allocating item 5 (46), as it is available and has a higher valuation than any other remaining item.
9. **Agent 0**: Allocating item 6 (4), as it is the only item left.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0, 1, 5],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed and each agent receives the items that maximize their valuations.
