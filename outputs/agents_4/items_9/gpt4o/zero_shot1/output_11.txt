Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  87  62   2  10  13  64  50  34
1  41  22   7   3  78  53  93  68   4
2  43  96  53  53  10  92  49  93  59
3   8  95  64  43  69   8  50  12  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. We will try to ensure that each agent receives at least two items since there are 4 agents and 9 items.

Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0 preferences**: Items 1 (87) and 0 (68) have the highest values.
2. **Agent 1 preferences**: Items 6 (93) and 4 (78) have the highest values.
3. **Agent 2 preferences**: Items 1 (96) and 7 (93) have the highest values.
4. **Agent 3 preferences**: Items 8 (78) and 1 (95) have the highest values.

Let's begin the allocation by ensuring each agent gets their most preferred item, and then distribute the remaining items to maximize total value while considering fairness.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 1 (87) and 0 (68)
2. **Agent 1**: Items 6 (93) and 4 (78)
3. **Agent 2**: Items 2 (53) and 7 (93)
4. **Agent 3**: Items 8 (78) and 3 (43)

This allocation gives each agent two items except for one agent who will get one item so that the total number of items is 9. Now, we need to finalize and assign the last item in a manner that tries to balance the total valuation.

Since Agent 0 already has high value items, we can assign the last item to Agent 3 to balance things out:

- Assign item 5 (8) to Agent 3.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [8, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
