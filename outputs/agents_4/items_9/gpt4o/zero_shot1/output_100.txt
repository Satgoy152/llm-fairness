Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  56  38  94  16  26  71  39  59
1  75  42  59  48  17  43  93  80  25
2  79  79  47  34  47  14  21   2  65
3  15  45  26  64  57  23  93  18  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations first. This approach attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the valuations:

1. Identify the highest value that each agent has for the items and allocate those items first, ensuring no item is double-allocated.
2. Continue allocating items to agents based on the descending order of their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 should get item 3 (value 94) and item 0 (value 69), as these are the highest valuations available to them.
- Agent 1 should get item 6 (value 93) and item 7 (value 80), which are their highest available valuations.
- Agent 2 should get item 1 (value 79) and item 2 (value 47), which are their highest available valuations.
- Agent 3 should get item 4 (value 57) and item 8 (value 28), which are their highest available valuations.
- This leaves item 5, which can be allocated to Agent 0 as they have the next highest valuation for remaining items.

Following this strategy, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents based on the highest valuations, with each agent receiving items they value highly.
