Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  77  44  66  86  76  44  84  41
1  20  41  70  22   4  31  43  55  70
2  32  37  56  54  11  49   4  62  99
3   7  29  39   3  28  50  98  81  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that all items are distributed, we can try to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their individual preferences. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 and item 8 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 8, but it is already allocated to agent 1. The next highest is item 7, but it's allocated to agent 0, so we look at item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values items 6, 8, and 7 highly, but items 8 and 7 are already allocated. Item 6 is still available.

Considering the above and trying to balance the distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 8]
- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 3]
- **Agent 3**: Items [6, 1, 7]

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [6, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations, and all 9 items are distributed.
