Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  20  19  89  68  74  72  59  66
1  21  66  32   4  64  71  67   4  88
2  19  75   5  69  76  17  30  78  10
3  19  19  57  49  42   4  81  20  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 20 19 89 68 74 72 59 66]
 [21 66 32  4 64 71 67  4 88]
 [19 75  5 69 76 17 30 78 10]
 [19 19 57 49 42  4 81 20 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation for their allocated items is approximately balanced. Let's consider the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 3 the most (89), followed by item 5 (74). Let's allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 8 the most (88), followed by item 5 (71). Since item 5 is already allocated, let's give Agent 1 item 8, and the next best options, item 4 (64).
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 4 the most (76), but it's taken, so let's allocate items 1 (75) and 7 (78) to them.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 6 the most (81). Let's allocate item 6 to them. Since they do not have any other high-valued options, we will give them a lower value item, item 2 (57).

Now, let's verify and finalize the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** [3, 5] - Total valuation = 89 + 74 = 163
- **Agent 1:** [8, 4] - Total valuation = 88 + 64 = 152
- **Agent 2:** [1, 7] - Total valuation = 75 + 78 = 153
- **Agent 3:** [6, 2, 0] - Total valuation = 81 + 57 + 19 = 157

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations fairly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [8, 4],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [6, 2, 0]
}
```
