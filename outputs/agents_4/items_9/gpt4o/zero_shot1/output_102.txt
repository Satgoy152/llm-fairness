Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  77  25   0  58  52  52   1  78
1  78  27  85  67  17  11  69  51  52
2  78  95  37  87  26  95   1  46  60
3  71  49  94  76  37  86   6  77   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction, ensuring each agent receives at least two items to maintain equity. We will consider the highest valuations by each agent for the items to guide the allocation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values highest: Item 8 (78) and Item 1 (77).
   - Allocate Items: [8, 1]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest remaining value is Item 2 (85).
   - Next highest is Item 3 (67).
   - Allocate Items: [2, 3]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest remaining value is Item 5 (95).
   - Next highest is Item 7 (46).
   - Allocate Items: [5, 7]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocate the remaining items: Item 4 (37), Item 0 (71), Item 6 (6).
   - Allocate Items: [4, 0, 6]

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [4, 0, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance fairness by considering each agent's highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
