Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  82  88  86  84  81  95  80  49
1   8  67  36  53  11  88  64  45  27
2  37  81  36  79  25  40  88   1  91
3  34  70  64  65  25  12  63   4  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 82 88 86 84 81 95 80 49]
 [ 8 67 36 53 11 88 64 45 27]
 [37 81 36 79 25 40 88  1 91]
 [34 70 64 65 25 12 63  4 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 0.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 5, 1, and 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 6, 8, 1, 3, and 0.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 8, 1, and 2.

We need to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (sum of values) is maximized while ensuring fairness:

1. **Assign high-value items:**
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (95), Item 2 (88)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (88), Item 1 (67)
   - Agent 2: Item 8 (91), Item 3 (79)
   - Agent 3: Item 2 (64)

2. **Assign remaining items:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 4, 7
   - Agent 0 can take Item 0 (13) [low value for others]
   - Agent 2 can take Item 4 (25) [some value for Agent 2]
   - Agent 3 can take Item 7 (4) [low value for others]

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [8, 3, 4],
    "3": [7]
}
```
