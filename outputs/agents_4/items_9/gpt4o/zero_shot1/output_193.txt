Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  59  37  59  11  23  73   1  56
1  81  32   9  20  51  78  27  30  25
2  77  28  47  49  45  18  54  51  49
3  52  43  73  69  82  74  96  45  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives or balance the allocation based on their preferences. We'll use a greedy approach considering the highest valuation preference of each agent for different items, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each agent gets at least one item.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (75)
   - Next preference: Item 6 (73)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 5 (78)
   - Next preference: Item 0 (81), but already taken, so Item 4 (51)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (77), but already taken, so Item 2 (47)
   - Next preference: Item 3 (49)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: Item 6 (96), but already taken, so Item 4 (82), but already taken, so Item 5 (74), but already taken, so Item 2 (73), but already taken, so Item 3 (69)

Let's assign the remaining items to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [5, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]
- Agent 3: [8, 1, 7]

Thus, the allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [8, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their preferences while distributing all the items.
