Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  62  43  85  75  21  72   4  30
1  80  11  37  53  54  37  46  30  85
2  45  67  90  29  74  53  45   7  44
3  81  70  91  19   5  58  62   8  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's look at the valuations and try to allocate items to each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: High-value items for Agent 0 are 3 (85) and 4 (75).
2. **Agent 1**: High-value items for Agent 1 are 0 (80) and 8 (85).
3. **Agent 2**: High-value items for Agent 2 are 2 (90) and 1 (67).
4. **Agent 3**: High-value items for Agent 3 are 2 (91) and 0 (81).

Based on these high-value items, let's allocate items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 3 and 4.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 0 and 8.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 1 and 6.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 2, 5, and 7.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
