Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  19  95  27  55  79  75  72  66
1  78  83  25  78  12  22  82  65  64
2  79  20  82  58  85   6  79  12  92
3  96  60  90  33  58   0  42  35  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. We can use a greedy approach by assigning items to the agent that values them the most, ensuring fairness by distributing items as evenly as possible among the agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 3 values it the most at 96.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the most at 83.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
4. **Item 3:** Both agents 0 and 1 value it at 78, but agent 1 already has an item, so assign it to agent 0.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it the most at 85.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the most at 79, but already has 2 items. Assign to agent 2 (next highest at 6).
7. **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it the most at 82.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it the most at 72, but already has 2 items. Assign to agent 3 (next highest at 35).
9. **Item 8:** Agent 2 values it the most at 92.

Now, each agent has received at least 2 items, and all items have been allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [4, 5, 8],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least two items, and it distributes the remaining items fairly based on the agents' valuations.
