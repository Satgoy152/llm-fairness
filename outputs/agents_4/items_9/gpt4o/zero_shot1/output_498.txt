Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  34  91  85  64  67  54  47  17
1  10  90   3  25  61  54  63  11  71
2  16   1  34  80  65  89  36  44  43
3   2  75  14  57  86  15   5   2  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total value. However, since each agent can only receive an integer number of items, we must balance this with fairness. Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item (if possible), and the total number of items allocated is equal to 9.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: Value 69
  - Item 2: Value 91

- Agent 1:
  - Item 1: Value 90
  - Item 8: Value 71

- Agent 2:
  - Item 5: Value 89
  - Item 3: Value 80

- Agent 3:
  - Item 4: Value 86
  - Item 6: Value 5
  - Item 7: Value 2

This allocation assigns each item to the agent that values it highly, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [4, 6, 7]
}
```
