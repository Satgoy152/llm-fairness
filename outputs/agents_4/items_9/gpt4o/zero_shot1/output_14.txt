Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  53  78   7  53  17  83  95  60
1  89  39  40  37  62  97  48  21  57
2  70  42  83  90  12  66  35  23  56
3  97  43  17  97  54  21  58  21  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent is reasonably satisfied with the items they receive, given their valuations. A common approach to achieve this is to maximize the total value each agent receives or ensure a balanced distribution of high-value items.

Let's analyze the table to find a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 6 (83), Item 2 (78), Item 7 (95)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (97), Item 0 (89), Item 4 (62)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (90), Item 2 (83), Item 5 (66)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (97), Item 0 (97), Item 6 (58)

Now let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** We will give items that are highly valued by Agent 0 and not highly valued by others.
  - Allocated: Item 7 (95), Item 6 (83)

- **Agent 1:** Allocate the highest valued items for this agent.
  - Allocated: Item 5 (97), Item 1 (39)

- **Agent 2:** Allocate the highest valued items for this agent.
  - Allocated: Item 3 (90), Item 8 (56)

- **Agent 3:** Allocate the remaining high-valued items for this agent.
  - Allocated: Item 0 (97), Item 4 (54), Item 2 (17)

Verify the allocation sums to 9 items, and present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [0, 4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
