Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  85  82  88  23   0   2  98  78
1  48  42  96  57  63  16  35  82  35
2  61  26   7  39   7  20   7  40  29
3  54  87  13  14  84   2  94  60  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring a roughly equal distribution of items. One approach is to use a greedy allocation strategy where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 61.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 87.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 3.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 96.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 88.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 84.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 3.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 0.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 0.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 94.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 3.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 98.
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 0.

9. **Item 8**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 78.
   - Allocate item 8 to agent 0.

The allocations based on this strategy are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated items based on their highest valuations, ensuring a fair distribution across the agents.
