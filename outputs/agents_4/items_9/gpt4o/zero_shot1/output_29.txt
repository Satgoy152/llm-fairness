Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56   0  32  32  21  83  85  48  88
1  86  60  29  83  86  88  20  51  91
2  24   6  11  38  41  80  69  89  56
3  82   4   9  96  25  71  17   9  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a simple allocation strategy that tries to maximize the total value for each agent. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent can potentially achieve by summing their valuations for all items.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's total value while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items that give the highest value to Agent 0.
  - Item 8 (value 88)
  - Item 6 (value 85)
  - Item 5 (value 83)

- **Agent 1**: Assign items that give the highest value to Agent 1.
  - Item 7 (value 51)
  - Item 3 (value 83)
  - Item 4 (value 86)

- **Agent 2**: Assign items that give the highest value to Agent 2.
  - Item 1 (value 6)
  - Item 2 (value 11)

- **Agent 3**: Assign the remaining item to Agent 3.
  - Item 0 (value 82)

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6, 5],
    "1": [7, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
