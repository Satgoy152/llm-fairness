Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  63   8  36  41  23  75  47  87
1  69  41  97  31   6  15  30  82  29
2  58  63  44   3  92  18   7   4  72
3  46  22  76  47  20  88  96  28  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 9 items allocated. A fair allocation might try to maximize the total valuation or ensure each agent is satisfied with their allocation. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Give items that Agent 0 values highly.
2. Agent 1: Give items that Agent 1 values highly.
3. Agent 2: Give items that Agent 2 values highly.
4. Agent 3: Give items that Agent 3 values highly.

Let's allocate items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly (92), so give item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly (97), so give item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly (92), so give item 4 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly (96), so give item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining 5 items:

- Agent 0 also values item 8 (87) highly, so give item 8 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 7 (82) highly, so give item 7 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 (63) highly, so give item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 (88) highly, so give item 5 to Agent 3.
- Finally, Agent 0 can take item 3 (36), which is one of the remaining items.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8, 3],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [6, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
