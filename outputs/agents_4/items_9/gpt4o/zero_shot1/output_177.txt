Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  51  34  47  49  96   3  38  42
1  90  87  50  70   5  88  48  10  96
2  98   5   4  56  11  63  30  16  31
3  37  24  26  41  73  60  97  63  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider both maximizing the total value each agent receives and ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll try to balance the distribution based on the valuations provided.

Let's analyze the table to find a fair distribution:

Agent 0:
- Highest values: Item 5 (96), Item 4 (49), Item 3 (47)
  
Agent 1:
- Highest values: Item 0 (90), Item 8 (96), Item 3 (70)

Agent 2:
- Highest values: Item 0 (98), Item 5 (63), Item 3 (56)

Agent 3:
- Highest values: Item 6 (97), Item 4 (73)

Now, let's attempt an allocation:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 5, Item 3
- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0, Item 8
- Agent 2: 
  - Item 2, Item 7
- Agent 3: 
  - Item 1, Item 4, Item 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value and each item is allocated. Let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation takes into account the agents' valuations and aims to fairly distribute the items among them.
