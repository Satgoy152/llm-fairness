Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  83   8  28  61  50  31  86  59
1  37  15   1   6  39  78  81  39  56
2  46  90  82  52  87  66  28  72  40
3  12  55  35  49  91  58  83  10  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 7.
- Agent 1 values items 5, 6 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 1, 2, 4 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 4, 6 highly.

A proposed allocation strategy can be:

1. Assign items to the agents with the highest value for each item, ensuring no agent has more than their fair share of items, given there are 9 items and 4 agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 7
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4
- Agent 3: Items 1, 3, 8

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it highly while also distributing the items evenly.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1, 3, 8]
}
```
