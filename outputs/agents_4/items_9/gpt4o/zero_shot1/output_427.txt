Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  74  11  66  31  54  35  19  98
1   2  16  24  88  31  17  68  57  19
2  71   1  68  76  60  97  97  12  56
3  68  99  94  98  20  52  59  90  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible. Given the valuations table, one way to approach this is to consider each agent's highest valued items and try to allocate them accordingly.

Let's start by examining the highest value items for each agent:

- Agent 0: Highest value is item 8 (98), followed by item 0 (87).
- Agent 1: Highest value is item 3 (88).
- Agent 2: Highest values are item 5 (97) and item 6 (97).
- Agent 3: Highest value is item 3 (98), but since it's taken by Agent 1, next highest is item 1 (99).

Now let's allocate the items while ensuring fairness:

1. Allocate item 8 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (one of the highest values for Agent 2).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (next highest value available for Agent 3).

Now let's continue allocating remaining items:

5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2).
7. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (next best available for Agent 1).
8. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 (next best available for Agent 3).
9. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (next best choice to balance item count).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least two items, and we maximize the values where possible.

Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0],
    "1": [3, 4, 2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
