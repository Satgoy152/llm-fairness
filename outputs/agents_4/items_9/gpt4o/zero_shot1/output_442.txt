Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  60   2  65   4  44  74  25  65
1  28  39  79  94   4  80  73  14  90
2  98  19  82  40  81  53   1  97  79
3  38  16   1  25  31  54  83  79  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[48 60  2 65  4 44 74 25 65]
 [28 39 79 94  4 80 73 14 90]
 [98 19 82 40 81 53  1 97 79]
 [38 16  1 25 31 54 83 79 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Let's analyze the valuation matrix and perform an allocation:

Valuation matrix:
```
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  |  48  60   2  65   4  44  74  25  65
1  |  28  39  79  94   4  80  73  14  90
2  |  98  19  82  40  81  53   1  97  79
3  |  38  16   1  25  31  54  83  79  91
```

To maximize the fairness, we can allocate items based on the highest unique valuations per item, ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 98 by Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 60 by Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 82 by Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 94 by Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 81 by Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 80 by Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 83 by Agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 97 by Agent 2.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 91 by Agent 3.

We also ensure that every agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 4, 7
- Agent 3: Items 6, 8

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 4, 7],
    "3": [6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are fairly distributed among the agents, maximizing the total value received by each agent.
