Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  48  74  60  27  59  68  38   1
1  41  63  58  92  86   6  82  67  47
2  15  72  17  74   3   3  43  97  11
3  50  25   9  89  34  18  49  32  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to distribute the items such that each agent has an approximately equal total value of items, while also ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. **Evaluate the total value each agent can gain by having certain items.**
2. **Distribute the items in a way that aims to balance the total value across all agents.**

Let's calculate a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 seems to value items 2, 6, and 3 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most but also item 4 highly.
- Agent 2 places high value on items 7.
- Agent 3 has higher values at item 3 and 8.

Now, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 6] (Values: 74, 68)
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 4] (Values: 92, 86)
- **Agent 2**: Items [7] (Values: 97)
- **Agent 3**: Items [0, 1, 5, 8] (Values: 50, 25, 18, 75)

Now let's see if this allocation is fair:

- **Agent 0's total value**: 74 + 68 = 142
- **Agent 1's total value**: 92 + 86 = 178
- **Agent 2's total value**: 97
- **Agent 3's total value**: 50 + 25 + 18 + 75 = 168

This distribution is fairly balanced given the constraints of integer distributions. 

Now, letâ€™s present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 1, 5, 8]
}
```
