Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  53  34  13  94  26   1  11  47
1  97  45  28  58  62  77  84  59  33
2  63  41  88  17  23  23  92  71  38
3  89  61  60  67  33  82  48  95  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation. One approach is to use a variant of the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, which ensures that each agent gets the items that provide them with the highest possible value.

Let's allocate the items considering the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest values: item 4 (94), item 0 (64), item 1 (53).
  
- Agent 1:
  - Highest values: item 0 (97), item 6 (84), item 5 (77).

- Agent 2:
  - Highest values: item 6 (92), item 2 (88), item 7 (71).

- Agent 3:
  - Highest values: item 7 (95), item 5 (82), item 3 (67).

To ensure a fair allocation, we will try to allocate items such that each agent gets their highest valued items, and no item is given to more than one agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 4.
2. Agent 1 gets item 0.
3. Agent 2 gets item 6.
4. Agent 3 gets item 7.
5. Agent 0 gets item 1.
6. Agent 1 gets item 5.
7. Agent 2 gets item 2.
8. Agent 3 gets item 3.
9. Agent 0 gets item 8.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share, maximizing their respective valuations as much as possible.

Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 8],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 4 agents, maximizing their individual valuations.
