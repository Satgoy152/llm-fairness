Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  34  54  16  17  51  28  85  81
1  59  76  14  10  65  31  95   6  32
2  68  21  64  26  77  14  48  23  65
3  89  93  79  79  40  75  64  59  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items assigned to them while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent iteratively, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item to maintain fairness and balance across allocations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest at 85, so we assign item 7 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the highest at 95, so we assign item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 77, so we assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 93, so we assign item 1 to agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 5, and 8.

Let's continue assigning the remaining items to maximize value:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the second highest at 81, so we assign item 8 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the second highest at 59, so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the second highest at 64, so we assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the second highest at 79, so we assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the next highest at 14, so we assign item 5 to agent 2.

Thus, each agent receives a fair allocation of items based on their valuations.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [4, 2, 5],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
