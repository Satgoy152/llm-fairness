Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  24  68  58  80  42  97  92  44
1  83  54  33  58  57  85  80  88  30
2  97  76   8  80  28  89   3  57  23
3  90  23  59  17  72  22  93  87  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 4 agents and 9 items, one possible fair distribution is to allocate two agents with 2 items each and two agents with 3 items each.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [70, 24, 68, 58, 80, 42, 97, 92, 44]
   - Highest valued items: 6 (97), 7 (92), 4 (80)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [83, 54, 33, 58, 57, 85, 80, 88, 30]
   - Highest valued items: 0 (83), 7 (88), 5 (85)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [97, 76, 8, 80, 28, 89, 3, 57, 23]
   - Highest valued items: 0 (97), 5 (89), 3 (80)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [90, 23, 59, 17, 72, 22, 93, 87, 72]
   - Highest valued items: 6 (93), 0 (90), 7 (87)

To ensure a fair allocation, we can distribute the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items [6, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Items [5, 1]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 3, 8]
- **Agent 3**: Items [4, 2]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [0, 3, 8],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest values and attempts to distribute the items in a way that respects the agents' preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
