Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  96  17  56  93  88  26  50  89
1  59   4  98  61  12  48  29  76  24
2  47  80  44  31  76  69  91  15  74
3  17  54  55  40  23  53  76  17  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for the items. Each agent should receive approximately 9/4 = 2.25 items, meaning some agents will receive 2 items and others will receive 3 items, while ensuring that the total allocation of items equals 9.

Let's start by attempting to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, ensuring fairness by keeping the allocations balanced:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations - [54, 96, 17, 56, 93, 88, 26, 50, 89]
   - Highest valued items: 1 (96), 4 (93)
   - Allocate items: [1, 4]

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations - [59, 4, 98, 61, 12, 48, 29, 76, 24]
   - Highest valued items: 2 (98), 7 (76)
   - Allocate items: [2, 7]

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations - [47, 80, 44, 31, 76, 69, 91, 15, 74]
   - Highest valued items: 6 (91), 1 (80)
   - Allocate items: [6, 0]

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations - [17, 54, 55, 40, 23, 53, 76, 17, 74]
   - Highest valued items: 8 (74), 6 (76), but 6 is already allocated, so consider next highest: 5 (53)
   - Allocate items: [8, 3, 5]

Now, each agent has been allocated items in a manner that considers their highest valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of items.

The allocations are as follows: 

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [8, 3, 5]
}
```
