Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  76  93  18  26  84  51  13  89
1  91  16  97  50   6  32  30  55  70
2  60  13  95  87  41  85  47  90  69
3   5  36  31  38  90  17  52  71  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total items. Given there are 4 agents and 9 items, each agent would ideally get around 2 to 3 items.

Let's consider the valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values for agent 0 are items 2 (93), 5 (84), and 8 (89). Allocating items 2 and 8 to agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values for agent 1 are items 0 (91) and 2 (97). Item 2 has already been allocated. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values for agent 2 are items 2 (95), 3 (87), and 5 (85). Item 2 has already been allocated. Assign items 3 and 5 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest values for agent 3 are items 4 (90), 7 (71), and 8 (46). Item 8 has already been allocated. Assign items 4 and 7 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 8 items. The only remaining item is item 6, which hasn't been assigned yet.

- **Unallocated item (6)**: Assign it to the agent with relatively lower value items or fewer items assigned. In this case, agent 1 has only one item. Assign item 6 to agent 1.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
