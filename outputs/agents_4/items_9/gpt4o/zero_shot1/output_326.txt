Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  89  10  38  58  88  26  71  17
1  68  27  97  12   3  31  97  49  28
2  92  83  31  33  15  28  84  42   9
3  24  62  68  39  87   6  95  73  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 4 agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall value for each agent based on their preferences, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (value = 88).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (value = 97).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value = 92).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6 (value = 95).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items while keeping the allocations balanced:

- Agent 0: Already has item 5. Next highest valuations are items 1 (value = 89) and 4 (value = 58).
- Agent 1: Already has item 2. Next highest valuations are items 6 (value = 97) and 7 (value = 49).
- Agent 2: Already has item 0. Next highest valuations are items 1 (value = 83) and 6 (value = 84).
- Agent 3: Already has item 6. Next highest valuations are items 4 (value = 87) and 7 (value = 73).

However, since some items are highly valued by multiple agents, we need to make strategic choices to ensure fairness and maximize overall happiness. Here's a possible final distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 8
- Agent 3: Items 6, 4

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their highest preferences and that all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 3, 8],
    "3": [6, 4]
}
```
