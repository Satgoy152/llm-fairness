Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  62  72  39  29  16  58  49  33
1  16  32  93  27  68  22  46   3  20
2  18  72  11  80  58  92  31  42  57
3  78   2  93  24  22  11   0  99  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 62 72 39 29 16 58 49 33]
 [16 32 93 27 68 22 46  3 20]
 [18 72 11 80 58 92 31 42 57]
 [78  2 93 24 22 11  0 99 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can follow a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We will try to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it at 96, which is the highest valuation for that item.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it at 72, which is the highest valuation for that item.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it at 93, which is the highest valuation for that item.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it at 80, which is the highest valuation for that item.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it at 68, which is the highest valuation for that item.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it at 92, which is the highest valuation for that item.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it at 58, which is the highest valuation for that item.
8. Assign item 7 to agent 3 because agent 3 values it at 99, which is the highest valuation for that item.
9. Assign item 8 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it at 57, which is the highest valuation for that item.

Based on these allocations, here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 5, 8],
    "3": [7]
}
```
