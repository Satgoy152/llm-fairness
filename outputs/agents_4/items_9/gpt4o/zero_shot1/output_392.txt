Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  61  47  92  59  16   6  57  64
1  48  89  38  18  23   0  36  63  27
2  59  68  11  24  83  27  93  43  27
3  50  81  48  64  11  67   7  10  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to allocate the items such that the overall satisfaction of the agents is balanced and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [93, 61, 47, 92, 59, 16, 6, 57, 64]
Agent 1: [48, 89, 38, 18, 23, 0, 36, 63, 27]
Agent 2: [59, 68, 11, 24, 83, 27, 93, 43, 27]
Agent 3: [50, 81, 48, 64, 11, 67, 7, 10, 96]
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their highest-valued items.

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 7.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6.
4. **Agent 3** has a strong preference for item 8.

Now, let's allocate based on this:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 3.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1 and 7.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 6.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 8.

Now, there are three items left: 2, 4, and 5. We need to distribute these remaining items:

- **Agent 0** could also take item 2 since they value it decently.
- **Agent 2** can take item 4, which they have a good valuation for.
- **Agent 3** can take item 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value and attempts to balance the overall valuation distribution.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 2],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [8, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items.
