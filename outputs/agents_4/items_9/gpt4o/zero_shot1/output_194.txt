Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  21  73  19  19   2  80  80  15
1  22  15  46  64  50  15  43  24  89
2   8  41  82  10  96  13   7  62  90
3  72  68  55  11  89  76  11  91  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that exactly 9 items are allocated in total.

We can approach this by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations first, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (87)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 8 (89)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (96)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value: Item 7 (91)

Now, assign the remaining items based on the next highest valuations, while ensuring no agent exceeds a reasonable share:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest: Item 6 (80)

6. **Agent 3**:
   - Next highest: Item 5 (76)

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Next highest: Item 2 (82)

8. **Agent 1**:
   - Next highest: Item 3 (64)

9. **Agent 3**:
   - Next highest: Item 1 (68)

Here's how the allocations look in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [8, 3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [7, 5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
