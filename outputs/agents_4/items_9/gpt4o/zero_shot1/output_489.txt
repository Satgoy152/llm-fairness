Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  34  94  10  25  36  77  89  27
1  40  37  93  78  75  81   6   3  20
2  67  54  85  59   7  58  79   4  28
3  44  37  99  99  92  81  17  26  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. List all items and their valuations by each agent.
2. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
3. Allocate the item to that agent.
4. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, which means some agents may receive more items than others, but the total should sum up to 9 items.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 87.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 54.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 99.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 99.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most at 92.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 79.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 89.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it the most at 27.

Now, let's tally the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 7, and 8.
- Agent 1 receives item 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 6.
- Agent 3 receives items 2, 3, and 4.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
