Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  29  97  93  86  56  78  89  33
1  26  25  63  13  49  70  30  61  99
2  25  86  73   8  42  66  89  69   3
3  34  85  66  64  12  21  64  23  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that considers each agent's valuations and ensures each agent receives at least one item. In this scenario, a fair allocation would be one where agents receive items that have relatively high valuations for them, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Below is a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Assign items based on highest valuations:** We will initially assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each agent gets the items they value the highest, which is a common method to achieve fairness when possible.

2. **Adjust for balanced distribution:** After assigning items based on highest valuations, we might need to adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item and that all items are distributed.

Let's begin the allocation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 3 values it highest at 34.
- **Item 1:** Agent 2 values it highest at 86.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it highest at 97.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it highest at 93.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it highest at 86.
- **Item 5:** Agent 1 values it highest at 70.
- **Item 6:** Agent 2 values it highest at 89.
- **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it highest at 89.
- **Item 8:** Agent 1 values it highest at 99.

Now, we need to ensure each agent has at least one item. Let's verify and adjust:

- **Agent 0** has items: 2, 3, 4, 7
- **Agent 1** has items: 5, 8
- **Agent 2** has items: 1, 6
- **Agent 3** has items: 0

All agents have at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [0]
}
```
