Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  10  37  17   1  84  48  41  38
1  66  23   6  78  20  27  99  51   1
2   2  38  26  23  92  52   8   8  84
3  93  41   2  14  33  81  10  59  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while also ensuring each agent gets roughly an equal number of items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items to understand their preferences.
2. Allocate items to agents to maximize their total value, considering that each agent should receive at least one item if possible.

Let's compute the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \( 94 + 10 + 37 + 17 + 1 + 84 + 48 + 41 + 38 = 370 \)
- Agent 1: \( 66 + 23 + 6 + 78 + 20 + 27 + 99 + 51 + 1 = 371 \)
- Agent 2: \( 2 + 38 + 26 + 23 + 92 + 52 + 8 + 8 + 84 = 333 \)
- Agent 3: \( 93 + 41 + 2 + 14 + 33 + 81 + 10 + 59 + 68 = 401 \)

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 5 (values: 94, 84)
- **Agent 1**: Items 6, 3 (values: 99, 78)
- **Agent 2**: Items 4, 8 (values: 92, 84)
- **Agent 3**: Items 1, 7, 2 (values: 41, 59, 2)

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preference while ensuring that each agent ends up with a fair share of items. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [1, 7, 2]
}
```
