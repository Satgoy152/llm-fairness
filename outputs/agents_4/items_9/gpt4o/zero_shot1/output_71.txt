Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  19  89  26   6  25  69  60  59
1  17  59  61   2  88  63  94  75  85
2  40  13  87  59  57  93  48  57  70
3  75  90  77  61  91  38  31  49  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[57 19 89 26  6 25 69 60 59]
 [17 59 61  2 88 63 94 75 85]

 [75 90 77 61 91 38 31 49 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Here is one possible allocation that attempts to balance the distribution:

- Agent 0: Valuations are generally lower compared to others, so we try to allocate items that maximize their satisfaction.
- Agent 1: Has high valuations for items 4, 6, and 8.
- Agent 2: Has a high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 3: Has high valuations across the board, so they can be given items that other agents do not highly value.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. Assign items based on maximizing each agent's top valuations while ensuring each receives an integer number of items.
2. Balance the allocations so each agent gets approximately 2-3 items.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 6, 8],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This distribution ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair portion based on their valuations.
