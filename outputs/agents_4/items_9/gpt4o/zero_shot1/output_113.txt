Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  28  54   0  54   8  32  68  28
1  94   9  79  87  26  26  28  74  29
2  66  93  14  20  90  20  48  71  61
3   4  51  56  10   5  56  46  83  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. There are many possible ways to fairly allocate, and one approach is to maximize the total value assigned to each agent.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on high-value items for this agent. Items 1 (28), 2 (54), and 6 (32) can be allocated to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Items 0 (94) and 3 (87) are high-value for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Items 4 (90) and 8 (61) are notable values for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Items 5 (56) and 7 (83) have good values for Agent 3.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents and each agent receives items that provide them with good value.
