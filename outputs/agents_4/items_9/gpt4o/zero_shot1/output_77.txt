Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  17  21  79  36   6   9  91  20
1   5   0  33  68  36  10  55  92  60
2  32  20   5  31  34  98  45  66  73
3  80  78  32  89  59  71  21  48  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Evaluate the valuations to see which agent values a particular item the most.
2. Allocate items to agents based on maximizing their satisfaction.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (80).
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most (78).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (21).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (89).
- Item 4: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it equally (36). Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (98).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (55).
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most (92).
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most (73).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 6, 7],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations.
