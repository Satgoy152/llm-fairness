Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  37  97  68  77   0  75  92   4
1  86  21  46  29  87  76  81  54  87
2  17  15  85  86  21  61  18  12  95
3  91  24  68  40  43  34  72  51  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. We'll try to maximize the total satisfaction (total valuation) for each agent given the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent:** 
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (97), Item 1 (37)
   - Agent 1: Item 8 (87), Item 4 (87)
   - Agent 2: Item 8 (95), Item 3 (86)
   - Agent 3: Item 0 (91), Item 2 (68)

2. **Allocate highest-valued items to each agent ensuring that items are unique:**
   - Item 2 is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 3. We will allocate it to Agent 0 since it's their highest value item.
   - Item 8 is highly valued by both Agent 1 and Agent 2. We will allocate it to Agent 2 since it's their highest value item.

3. **Continue allocation based on remaining high-value preferences:**
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (97), Item 7 (92)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (87), Item 6 (81)
   - Agent 2: Item 8 (95), Item 3 (86), Item 5 (61)
   - Agent 3: Item 0 (91), Item 1 (24)

4. **Ensure that all items are allocated:**
   - Items allocated: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] (all items are covered)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [8, 3, 5],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their highest preferences while ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
