Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  11  21  78  27  28  62  64  91
1  24  73  24  18  82  16  18  57  39
2  75  19  71  36  34  65   7  59  44
3  93  68  60   1  56  90  13   3  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can adopt a strategy to give each agent the items they value the most. We will ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 8.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 but it's already taken by Agent 2, so we choose the next highest item which is item 5.

After these allocations, we will distribute the remaining items considering the next highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Already has item 8. Next highest is item 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Already has item 4. Next highest is item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Already has item 0. Next highest is item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Already has item 5. Next highest is item 8, but it's already taken, so we choose item 7.

Now, we allocate the remaining items by checking who values them next:

1. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 62, which is the highest remaining valuation.
2. Item 9: The remaining item is allocated to Agent 3, who has the next highest valuation for it.

Let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed.
