Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  27  60  31  96  70   6  58  37
1  96  85   4  84  92  58  50  47  33
2   9  19   8  93  40  53  98  54   6
3  53  11  93   4  81  14  34  35  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 85  4 84 92 58 50 47 33]

 [53 11 93  4 81 14 34 35 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations. One approach is to aim for maximizing the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 1, and 4 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 0, 1, 3, and 4 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 3 and 6 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 2, 4, and 8 highly.

Let's distribute the items considering these preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, while maximizing the overall valuation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (96) - highest valuation.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (27) - second-highest valuation among remaining agents.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (93) - highest valuation.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (93) - highest valuation.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (96) - highest valuation.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (58) - highest valuation among remaining.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (98) - highest valuation.
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (58) - highest valuation.
9. Assign item 8 to Agent 3 (81) - highest valuation.

With these allocations, each agent receives a reasonable number of items and the allocation aims to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2, 8]
}
```
