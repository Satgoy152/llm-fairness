Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  69  89  39  93  70  24  95  55
1  19  41  78  81  28  25  76  24  14
2  16   2  76  75  30   3  77  77  15
3  13  28  54  65  16  76  30  76  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, one approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the best possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: 95 (item 7), 93 (item 4), 89 (item 2)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 81 (item 3), 78 (item 2), 76 (item 6)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 77 (item 6), 77 (item 7), 76 (item 2)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 76 (item 5), 76 (item 7), 65 (item 3)

Considering these preferences and the constraint to allocate all items, let's assign the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocated items 0, 4, and 7 (values: 50, 93, 95)
- **Agent 1**: Allocated items 2 and 3 (values: 78, 81)
- **Agent 2**: Allocated items 6 and 8 (values: 77, 15)
- **Agent 3**: Allocated items 1 and 5 (values: 28, 76)

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their highest values for the items and all items are allocated.
