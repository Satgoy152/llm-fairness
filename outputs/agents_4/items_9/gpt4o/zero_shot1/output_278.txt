Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  59  57  59  33  47  71  30   6
1  10  33  88  95  87  74  46  38  28
2  80  85  89  78  11  52  65  12  23
3  96  70  68   9   2  73  11  65  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the matrix of valuations, we need to find an allocation that provides a balanced distribution of value across the agents.

Let's consider the highest-value items for each agent and allocate them accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 6 (71), 1 (59), 3 (59)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation items: 3 (95), 2 (88), 4 (87), 5 (74)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation items: 2 (89), 1 (85), 0 (80)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation items: 0 (96), 1 (70), 5 (73)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, distribute the remaining items while considering each agent's remaining high-value items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (59) and item 5 (47) since it's one of the highest remaining valuations for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 (87) and item 7 (38) which are good values for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 8 (23), which is the best remaining option for Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and fairly distributes the total value of items.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [0]
}
```
