Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  42  25  84  10  36  61  29  32
1  58  76   4  96  36  12  17  58  41
2  55  47  61  35   8  30  89  42  32
3  57  45   7  83  94  77  70  25   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences, while also ensuring that all items are distributed. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 3 and 6, which have high values of 84 and 61, respectively. We can allocate these items to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a very high valuation for item 3 (96), but we already allocated it to agent 0. However, agent 1 values item 1 highly (76), so we can allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 highly (89), but it was allocated to agent 0. Instead, we can allocate item 2 (61) to agent 2, which is their next highest valuation.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 4 highly (94), so we can allocate item 4 to agent 3. 

We continue this process, ensuring that each agent receives items that they value, while also making sure that all items are allocated.

Here is a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 5
- **Agent 3**: Items 0, 4, 8

Now, let's present the allocations in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 4, 8]
}
```
