Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  43  49  98   5  48  57  24  18
1  75  67  20  24  72  97  23  42  13
2  63  66  51  98   0  46  88  77  97
3   1  55  17  64  67  35  28   6  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that balances the total valuation each agent receives. In this context, "fair" can mean that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their overall satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring every agent gets some items, if possible.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items combined to get a sense of their preferences.
2. Allocate items iteratively, giving each item to the agent who values it the most, but ensuring that no agent ends up with an unreasonably large share compared to others.

Let's proceed with this approach:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations
- Agent 0: 51 + 43 + 49 + 98 + 5 + 48 + 57 + 24 + 18 = 393
- Agent 1: 75 + 67 + 20 + 24 + 72 + 97 + 23 + 42 + 13 = 433
- Agent 2: 63 + 66 + 51 + 98 + 0 + 46 + 88 + 77 + 97 = 586
- Agent 3: 1 + 55 + 17 + 64 + 67 + 35 + 28 + 6 + 26 = 299

### Step 2: Allocate Items
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest (75), assigned to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest (67), assigned to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest (49), assigned to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agents 0 and 2 both value it at 98, but to balance allocation, assign to Agent 2, who has a higher total valuation need.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest (72), assigned to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the highest (97), assigned to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the highest (88), assigned to Agent 2.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the highest (77), assigned to Agent 2.
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it the highest (97), assigned to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 3: []

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences while maintaining a balance in the distribution of total item values.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "2": [3, 6, 7, 8],
    "3": []
}
```
