Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  55  17  90  84  28   5  20  79
1  82  40  89  38  68  18  35  57   4
2  47  93  12  87  17  63  85  30  35
3  35  29  72  14  87  24  73  55  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (since there are 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive two items). We'll try to balance the allocations as fairly as possible:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value 90)
   - Second highest value item: Item 4 (value 84)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value 89)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 93)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value item: Item 8 (value 88)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items.

5. **Agent 0** already has two items, so we'll distribute the rest to other agents:
   - Agent 1 can take Item 0 (value 82)
   - Agent 2 can take Item 6 (value 85)
   - Agent 3 can take Item 4 (value 87)

Finally, we allocate the remaining items:
- Agent 1 takes Item 5 (value 18)
- Agent 3 takes Item 7 (value 55)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 0, 5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [8, 7]
}
```

These allocations ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, while all items are allocated.
