Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  40  44  99  49  70  26  35  61
1  92  99  78  60  12  43  84   6  58
2  22  92  56  17  26  92  68   3   6
3  91  54  29  29  88  77  70  39  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider a strategy that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring an even distribution of items. Each agent should ideally receive approximately the same number of items, considering there are 9 items and 4 agents.

One approach is to allocate items to the agents based on who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least 2 items (since 9 items divided among 4 agents means some agents will get 2 items, and some 3).

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (99), Item 5 (70)
   - Let's allocate Item 3 and Item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (99), Item 0 (92), Item 6 (84)
   - Let's allocate Item 1 and Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (92), Item 5 (92), Item 6 (68)
   - Item 1 and Item 5 are already allocated, so let's allocate Item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (91), Item 8 (90), Item 4 (88)
   - Item 0 is already allocated, so let's allocate Item 8 and Item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, two items are left: Item 2 and Item 7. We need to distribute these evenly:

- Let's give Item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
- Give Item 7 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 currently has only 1 item).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 3 items (3, 5, 2)
- Agent 1: 2 items (1, 0)
- Agent 2: 2 items (6, 7)
- Agent 3: 2 items (8, 4)

Now, let's present the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [8, 4]
}
```
