Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  87  70  74  53  64  54  84  70
1  77  20  90   1  60  42  43   3  28
2  67  91  23  84  16  73  89  27   2
3  30  60  57  52  74  52  74   4  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we aim to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share of value. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent can receive at least 2 items, with one agent receiving 3 items.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuation items: 1 (87), 7 (84)
   - Assign items: 1, 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuation items: 2 (90), 0 (77)
   - Assign items: 2, 0

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuation items: 1 (91), 6 (89)
   - Assign item: 6
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuation items: 4 (74), 5 (52), 3 (52)
   - Assign items: 4, 5, 3

Check the allocation to ensure all 9 items are allocated and no item is assigned to more than one agent. Adjust as needed for balance and fairness.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with relatively high valuations according to their preferences, and all items are assigned. Agent 3 receives three items to balance the total number of allocated items.
