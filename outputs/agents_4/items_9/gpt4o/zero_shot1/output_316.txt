Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  50  37  32  15  74  61  72   9
1  50  90  95  71  60   4  47  92  66
2  63  47  13  27  65  54  35  65  67
3  62  26  73  19  74  51  76  87  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 4 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent should ideally receive 2 or 3 items since there are 9 items and 4 agents.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by considering the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that no two agents are assigned the same item.
   - Try to balance the number of items allocated to each agent.

3. **Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5, 7, and 0.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 7.
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 8, 4, and 0.
   - Agent 3 has high valuations for items 8, 7, and 6.

   Given these preferences, the allocation can be arranged as follows:

   - Assign items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness in distribution.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 5, 0
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2
   - Agent 2: Items 4, 8
   - Agent 3: Items 3, 6, 7

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated, adhering to a fair distribution.
