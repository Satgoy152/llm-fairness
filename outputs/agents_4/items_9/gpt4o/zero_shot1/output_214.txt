Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  46  14  41  30  15  42  59  10
1  68  28  33  66  35  66  93   8  66
2   1  12  13  34  34  65  32  70  14
3   6  65  12  36  27  49   6   5  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here’s a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high value for item 0, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high values for items 6 and 5, so we allocate these items to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a relatively high value for item 7, so we allocate item 7 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to agent 3.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items (2, 3, 4, 8) to maximize the total value each agent receives:

- Allocate item 4 to agent 0 (value 30).
- Allocate item 8 to agent 1 (value 66).
- Allocate item 2 to agent 2 (value 13).
- Allocate item 3 to agent 3 (value 36).

Now, let’s present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 8],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are fairly distributed among the agents, considering their valuations.
