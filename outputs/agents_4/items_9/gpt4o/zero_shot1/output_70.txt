Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  71  44  52  60  78  56  64  90
1  42  31  74  95   2  13  98   2  39
2  69  85  75  58  99  28  31  14  13
3  44  52  68  29  22  61  85  19  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider distributing the total value in a balanced manner while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items based on maximizing the value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations

**Agent 0:** 90 + 71 + 44 + 52 + 60 + 78 + 56 + 64 + 90 = 605  
**Agent 1:** 42 + 31 + 74 + 95 + 2 + 13 + 98 + 2 + 39 = 396  
**Agent 2:** 69 + 85 + 75 + 58 + 99 + 28 + 31 + 14 + 13 = 472  
**Agent 3:** 44 + 52 + 68 + 29 + 22 + 61 + 85 + 19 + 96 = 476  

### Step 2: Allocate Items

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items.

- **Agent 0:** (90 for item 0, 90 for item 8)
- **Agent 1:** (98 for item 6, 95 for item 3)
- **Agent 2:** (99 for item 4, 85 for item 1)
- **Agent 3:** (96 for item 7, 68 for item 2, 61 for item 5)

### Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [7, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items such that their total valuation is maximized as much as possible given the constraints.
