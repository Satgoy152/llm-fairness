Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  52  13  78  44  37  86  35  76
1  60  52   9  31  22  62  15  12  93
2  14   0   9  32  58  27   0  65  39
3  83  33  67  38  65  22  82  77  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm or optimization methods to achieve a fair allocation. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's walk through the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (83).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (52).
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most (67).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (78).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (58).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (62).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (86).
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (65).
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it the most (93).

Now, make sure each agent receives at least one item and adjust the allocation as necessary to balance the distribution of items:

- Agent 0: Already has items (1, 3, 6).
- Agent 1: Already has items (5, 8).
- Agent 2: Already has items (4, 7).
- Agent 3: Already has items (0, 2).

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This ensures that all 9 items are allocated fairly among the four agents.
