Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  29  68  12  37  10  96  87  93
1  74  51  19  73  79   3  99  44  77
2  66  35  75  60   8  15   2  18  96
3  21  43   6  20  10  63  84  38  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values item 6 (96), item 8 (93), and item 2 (68).
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 6 (99), item 4 (79), and item 0 (74).
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 8 (96), item 2 (75), and item 0 (66).
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 6 (84) and item 5 (63).

To ensure a fair distribution, we will attempt to balance the allocation so that each agent receives a reasonable total value based on their preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

- Allocate items based on the highest available value each agent places on the remaining items. Start with the agent with the highest individual valuations.

Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: [6, 8]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 4]
- **Agent 2**: [2, 7]
- **Agent 3**: [1, 3, 5]

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 4 agents. Each agent gets items that they value relatively highly, creating a balanced allocation.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
