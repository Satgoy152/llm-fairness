Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  44   3  16   3   3  95  13  59
1  12  90  78  44   2  41   4  93  11
2   8  60  78  27  89  87  78  23  47
3  90  62  75   9  87  18  93  76  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: Evaluate which items are most valued by each agent.
2. **Allocate items to maximize fairness**: Ensure that each agent has a relatively balanced total value and no agent is left with significantly less value.

Let's analyze and allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 0 (84) and 6 (95).
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 1 (90) and 7 (93).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 4 (89) and 5 (87).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 0 (90) and 6 (93).

We need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. Consider the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocated items 0 and 2.
- **Agent 1**: Allocated items 1 and 7.
- **Agent 2**: Allocated items 4 and 5.
- **Agent 3**: Allocated items 3, 6, and 8.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.
