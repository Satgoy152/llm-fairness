Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  84  59  18  90  78  24  53  10
1  55  58   3  72  14  37  96  94  32
2   7  44  67  32  37  14  64  19  25
3  52  34  99  24  66  49  84  57  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. There are 4 agents and 9 items, so one approach could be to allocate 2 items to three agents and 3 items to one agent. 

Let's consider the valuations of each agent and try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent. We'll try to balance the allocation by giving consideration to the highest values first.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values are for items 0 (93), 4 (90)
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values are for items 6 (96), 7 (94)
   - Allocate items 6 and 7 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values are for items 2 (67), 6 (64)
   - Item 6 is already allocated, so choose next highest, item 1 (44)
   - Allocate items 2 and 1 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values are for items 2 (99), 6 (84)
   - Both items 2 and 6 are allocated, so choose next highest, item 5 (49)
   - Allocate items 3, 5, and 8 to Agent 3

Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed, with three agents receiving 2 items each and one agent receiving 3 items.
