Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  77   4  10  55  63  41  24  16
1  62  27   6  29  92  59  30  17  53
2  19  66  10  23  70  43  85  92  88
3  12  31  11  96  96  70  86  34  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 4 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive 3 items, and the other agents will receive 2 items each.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 7 and 8.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3 and 5.

Based on these observations, I will assign the items as follows to balance the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 1 (high valuations).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 4 and 6 (high valuation on 4, decent on 6).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 7 and 8 (high valuations).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items 2, 3, and 5 (decent valuations).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a reasonable number of items based on their preferences. Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
