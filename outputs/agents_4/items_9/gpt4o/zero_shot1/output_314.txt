Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  78  76  24  85  69  98  90  77
1  69  30  70  43  69  48  79  64  17
2  89   8  26  50   8  83  32   7  74
3  16  91  52   6   6  44  39  58   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to balance both the number of items each agent receives and the total valuation each agent gets from the items. Given there are 9 items and 4 agents, ideally, each agent should receive about 2 or 3 items. We'll try to optimize the allocation based on the agents' valuations of the items.

Let's consider the valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuations: Items 6 (98), 1 (78), 7 (90)
   - Allocate: Items 6, 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Items 0 (69), 6 (79), 4 (69)
   - Allocate: Items 0, 4

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Items 0 (89), 5 (83), 8 (74)
   - Allocate: Items 5, 8

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: Items 1 (91), 2 (52), 7 (58)
   - Allocate: Items 1, 2, 3

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least 2 items and the total valuation they receive is relatively balanced.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
