Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  43  60  55  70  10  72  76  43
1  76  44  69  76  89  14  70  99  27
2  45  79  58  20  86  44  39  91  92
3  57  91  27  18  52  34  96   0  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the sum of the valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent will receive approximately 2 items, with one agent receiving an additional item to account for the total of 9 items.

Let's examine the valuations in the table and attempt to allocate items to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (72), Item 7 (76)
   - Allocate: Items 6, 7

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (76), Item 4 (89)
   - Allocate: Items 3, 4

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (92), Item 7 (91)
   - Allocate: Items 8, 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (91), Item 6 (96)
   - Allocate: Items 0, 1, 5

Given these allocations, let's verify the item assignment:

- Agent 0 has items 6 and 7.
- Agent 1 has items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 has items 8 and 2.
- Agent 3 has items 0, 1, and 5.

Now, let's ensure that all 9 items are allocated and each agent has received an integer number of items:

- Total items allocated: 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 9

Finally, presenting this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [8, 2],
    "3": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations from the table.
