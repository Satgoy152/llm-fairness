Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  92  62  40  58  10  90  85  35
1  40  47  75  11  43  24  70  96  78
2   8  92   5  99  75  41  97  34  61
3  78  44  43  95  82  64   6  60  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent gets at least one item, with the total number of items summing to 9. We will aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 6, and 7. Let's assign agent 0 items 1 and 6.
- Agent 1 values item 7 highest, so let's give agent 1 item 7.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highest, let's assign agent 2 item 3.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3, but since it is already taken, we'll assign item 4 to agent 3, which is the next highest for them.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can also take item 0 (second highest after item 1).
- Agent 2 can take item 5 (another relatively higher valued item for them).
- Agent 1 can take item 8 (third highest valuation for agent 1).
- Agent 3 will take item 2.

We have now allocated 8 items. For the final item:

- Agent 0 can take item 2 as well, as it's one of the higher remaining valued items for them.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 0],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.
