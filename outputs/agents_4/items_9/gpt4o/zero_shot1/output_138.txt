Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  22  42  90  55  80  16  18  79
1  10  47  53  67  59  93  89  45  83
2  32  60  65  21  69  14  74  24  56
3  46  84  78  18  26  54  82   3  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Finding the Maximum Valuation for Each Agent**: Distribute items by assigning each agent the item they value the most, ensuring that no item is assigned to more than one agent. This helps in maximizing the individual satisfaction for each agent.

2. **Ensuring Fairness**: After assigning the highest valued item for each agent, allocate the remaining items to balance the number of items each agent receives, while also considering the next highest values for each agent.

Following these steps, we can arrive at the following allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 3 (90)
   - Agent 1 gets item 5 (93)
   - Agent 2 gets item 4 (69)
   - Agent 3 gets item 1 (84)

2. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 can receive item 8 (79)
   - Agent 1 can receive item 6 (89)
   - Agent 2 can receive item 2 (65)
   - Agent 3 can receive item 0 (46)

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Assign the last item 7 to Agent 1, who has a relatively high valuation for it.

Here's the final allocation represented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving an integer number of items, and attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.
