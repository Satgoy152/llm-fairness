Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  33  73  98  77   8  38  25  95
1  70  91  63   7  48  82  13  10  65
2   6  77  88   5   2  82  93   2  17
3  87  29   0  95  80  97  45  15   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents. However, since there are 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will have to receive fewer items than the others.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Determine the total number of items each agent should receive:**
   - Ideally, since there are 9 items and 4 agents, three agents can receive 2 items each, and one agent can receive 3 items. This adds up to a total of 9 items.

2. **Assign the items based on the highest preference for each agent, considering the fairness constraint:**
   - We will try to allocate higher valued items to the agents who value them the most.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values items 3 (98), 8 (95), and 0 (86) highly. Assign items 3 and 8.
- **Agent 1**: Values items 1 (91), 5 (82), and 0 (70) highly. Assign items 1 and 5.
- **Agent 2**: Values items 6 (93), 2 (88), and 1 (77) highly. Assign items 6 and 2.
- **Agent 3**: Values items 5 (97), 3 (95), and 4 (80) highly. Assign items 0, 4, and 7.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: [3, 8]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [6, 2]
- Agent 3: [0, 4, 7]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [0, 4, 7]
}
```
