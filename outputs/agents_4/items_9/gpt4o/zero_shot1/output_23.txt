Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  79  66  19   3  17   5  74  43
1  42  30  76  34  94  96  95  47  65
2  55  40  63  37  42  77  55  18  16
3  45  87  21  20   6  52  64  13  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a relatively equal total valuation. Given that there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive around 2 or 3 items.

Let's go through the process of allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (79), 7 (74), 2 (66)
   - Allocate items 1 and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (96), 6 (95), 4 (94)
   - Allocate items 5 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (77), 2 (63), 6 (55)
   - Since item 5 is already taken, allocate items 2 and 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (87), 6 (64), 5 (52)
   - Since items 1 and 6 are already taken, allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Checking remaining items**:
   - Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
   - Remaining items: 8

Allocate the remaining item 8 to Agent 3 since it increases their total valuation, balancing the overall valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 3, 8]
}
```
