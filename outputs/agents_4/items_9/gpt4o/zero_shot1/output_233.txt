Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  16  86  42  30  15   7  23  56
1  15  14  32  26  30  76  23  44  13
2  68   6  16  15  58  75  73  78  50
3   5  20  30  52  84  40  36  74  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for the items. We are looking for a way to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable mix of high-value items according to their own valuations. One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a greedy algorithm where we iteratively assign the highest value item available to the agent that values it the most and hasn't yet been assigned that item.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the allocation could be performed:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Assign that item to the agent if it hasn't been allocated yet.
3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Values item 2 the highest (value 86). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Values item 5 the highest (value 76). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Values item 7 the highest (value 78). Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3: Values item 4 the highest (value 84). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we have 5 items left to allocate: 0, 1, 3, 6, and 8. We’ll repeat the process:

- Agent 0: Next highest value is item 0 (value 46). Assign item 0.
- Agent 1: Next highest value is item 6 (value 23). Assign item 6.
- Agent 2: Next highest value is item 8 (value 50). Assign item 8.
- Agent 3: Next highest value is item 3 (value 52). Assign item 3.

One item is left (item 1). We’ll assign it to the agent who values it the most among those who have fewer items:

- Agent 0 has 2 items, Agent 1 has 2 items, Agent 2 has 2 items, Agent 3 has 2 items.
- From the remaining agents, Agent 3 values it the most (value 20). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [4, 3, 1]
}
```
