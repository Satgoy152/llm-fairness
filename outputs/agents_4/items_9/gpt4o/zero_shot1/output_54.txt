Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  34  75  72  65   1  85  40  22
1  24  29  46  59  80  43  90  33  28
2  81  55  93  62  73   8  75  93  19
3  87  53  73   9  36  13  64  76   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items based on maximizing the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable number of items. We'll try to allocate two to three items to each agent, given that there are four agents and nine items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: Item 6 (85), Item 2 (75), Item 3 (72).
   - Allocate: Item 6, Item 2.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: Item 6 (90), Item 4 (80), Item 3 (59).
   - Allocate: Item 4, Item 3.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: Item 2 (93), Item 7 (93), Item 0 (81).
   - Allocate: Item 7, Item 0.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: Item 0 (87), Item 7 (76), Item 2 (73).
   - Allocate: Item 1, Item 5, Item 8.

After checking the allocations, all items are allocated fairly among the agents, and each agent has a reasonable number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [7, 0],
    "3": [1, 5, 8]
}
```
