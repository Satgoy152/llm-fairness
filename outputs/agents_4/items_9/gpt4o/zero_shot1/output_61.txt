Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  68  53  54  30   5  84  36  16
1   6  31   1  30  67  33  72  52  55
2  29  93  27   9  36  85  69  17  98
3  50   8  51  58  69  52  90  38  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent has for the items. Since each agent should get an integer number of items, and there are 9 items to distribute, each agent should average about 2 items, with one agent receiving 3 items.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Ensure an equitable distribution of items among agents while maximizing their total valuations.

**Allocations:**

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 1, and 6.
- Agent 1 has relatively high values for items 4, 6, and 7.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 1, 5, and 8.
- Agent 3 has high values for items 6, 3, and 4.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- Allocate item 0 to agent 0 (value: 71).
- Allocate item 4 to agent 1 (value: 67).
- Allocate item 5 to agent 2 (value: 85).
- Allocate item 3 to agent 3 (value: 58).

Now, items 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 are left.

- Allocate item 1 to agent 2 (value: 93).
- Allocate item 6 to agent 0 (value: 84).
- Allocate item 8 to agent 2 (value: 98).
- Allocate item 7 to agent 1 (value: 52).

Finally, allocate item 2 to agent 0 (value: 53).

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [5, 1, 8],
    "3": [3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives either 2 or 3 items, and the allocation is designed to maximize the individual agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring all items are fairly distributed.
