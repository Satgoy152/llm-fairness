Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  69  69  29  59  36  14  62  75
1  63   4  61  34  44  17  34  45  78
2  28  58   4  67  59  94  64  13  71
3  83   5  74  62  49  63  42  90  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83  5 74 62 49 63 42 90 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. 

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** seems to value item 0 (87) and item 8 (75) the most.
2. **Agent 1** values item 8 (78) the most.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5 (94).
4. **Agent 3** values items 7 (90) and item 8 (87) highly.

Given these valuations, let's attempt to allocate items in a way that each agent gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0** can take items 0 and 8. This gives high value, especially from item 0.
- **Agent 1** can take items 1 and 3. This avoids high-value clashes with other agents.
- **Agent 2** can take items 2 and 5. Item 5 is highly valued by Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** can take items 4, 6, and 7. This allows Agent 3 to get a high-value item 7.

Now, let's provide the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.
