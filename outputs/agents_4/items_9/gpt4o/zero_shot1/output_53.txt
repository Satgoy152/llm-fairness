Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  91  58  73  55  57  41  44  88
1  86  75  53  28  94  74   4  93  32
2  97  59  16  51  75  44  62  40  29
3  11  98  96  51  46   8  74  11  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuations to maximize their individual satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

One simple way to approach this is to give each agent approximately the same number of items, considering that there are 4 agents and 9 items. This means some agents will receive 2 items, and one agent will receive 3 items.

Let's distribute the items so that each agent's total valuation is maximized:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items they value highest. They value item 1 (91) and item 8 (88) the most.

2. **Agent 1**: Their highest valuations are for items 4 (94) and 7 (93).

3. **Agent 2**: Their highest valuations are for items 0 (97) and 4 (75) but item 4 is already taken, so the next best is item 6 (62).

4. **Agent 3**: Their highest valuations are for items 1 (98), 2 (96), but item 1 is already taken, so item 2 and item 7 (11).

Now, let's allocate:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 8
- Agent 1: Items 4, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 6
- Agent 3: Items 2, 3, 5

Now each agent gets an integer number of items, and a total of 9 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
