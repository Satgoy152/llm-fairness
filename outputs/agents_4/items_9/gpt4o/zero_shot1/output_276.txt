Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  88   1  51  28  16  45  44  23
1  42  70  78  58  59  88  13  84  74
2  77  60  34  22  25  73  77  85  68
3  58  51   6  93  99  91  32  76  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method to distribute the items based on their valuations. This will ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0: Value 96
   - Item 1: Value 88 

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 2: Value 78
   - Item 5: Value 88

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 6: Value 77
   - Item 7: Value 85

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 3: Value 93
   - Item 4: Value 99
   - Item 8: Value 97

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items is 9. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3, 4, 8]
}
```
