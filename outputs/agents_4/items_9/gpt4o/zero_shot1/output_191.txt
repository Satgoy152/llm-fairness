Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  46  55  39   7  62  89  87  26
1   2  54  83  75  73  89  69  79  73
2  78  80  96  11  49  28   9  46  13
3  70  86   5  82  78  80  66  14  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 46 55 39  7 62 89 87 26]
 [ 2 54 83 75 73 89 69 79 73]

 [70 86  5 82 78 80 66 14 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Let's look at the valuations and find a suitable allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefer items with higher values like 6 (89), 7 (87), and 0 (81).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefer items with higher values like 5 (89), 2 (83), and 3 (75).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefer items with higher values like 2 (96), 1 (80), and 0 (78).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefer items with higher values like 1 (86), 3 (82), and 5 (80).

Let's try to allocate items while ensuring fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 6 and 7 (values 89 and 87).
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 5 and 3 (values 89 and 75).
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 2 and 0 (values 96 and 78).
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 1, 4, and 8 (values 86, 78, and 10).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [1, 4, 8]
}
```
