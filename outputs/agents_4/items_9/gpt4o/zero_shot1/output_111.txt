Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  52  86  12  27  95   6  84  64
1  82  31  49  55   3  62  69  30  77
2  58  58  41   1  63  78   7  18  91
3  64   7  10  17  32  77  33  36  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's approach this by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (95), Item 0 (92), Item 2 (86)
   - Assign items: [5, 0, 2]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (77), Item 6 (69), Item 5 (62)
   - Assign items: [8, 6]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (91), Item 5 (78), Item 4 (63)
   - Assign items: [4]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (91), Item 5 (77), Item 0 (64)
   - Assign items: [3, 1, 7]

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated and adjust if necessary:

- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (all items are covered)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, while ensuring a fair distribution.
