Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  42  98  88  59  23  30  18  35
1  62  60  98  41  63  21  36  72   2
2  64  95  98  52  39  34   9  14  83
3  60  56  70  20  44  31  10  88  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider distributing the items in a way that maximizes fairness. A possible approach is to ensure each agent is reasonably satisfied with their allocation based on their highest valuations for the items.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 2 (98) and item 3 (88). We will assign these two items to agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 2 (98) and item 7 (72). However, item 2 is already allocated to agent 0. We will assign item 7 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 1 (95) and item 2 (98). Item 2 is already allocated to agent 0, so we will assign item 1 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 7 (88) and item 8 (67). Item 7 is already allocated to agent 1, so we will assign item 8 to agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Has items 2 and 3.
- **Agent 1**: Has item 7.
- **Agent 2**: Has item 1.
- **Agent 3**: Has item 8.

Remaining items: 0, 4, 5, 6.

5. **Agent 0**: This agent can be allocated item 0, which is relatively valuable to them (44).

6. **Agent 1**: This agent can be allocated item 4, which is relatively valuable to them (63).

7. **Agent 2**: This agent can be allocated item 5, which has a moderate valuation (34).

8. **Agent 3**: This agent can be allocated item 6, which has a moderate valuation (10).

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 5
- **Agent 3**: Items 6, 8

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [6, 8]
}
```
