Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  33  93  77  82  49  68  80  68
1  68  88  83  95  25  23  48  37  98
2  72  46  82  88  81  97  19  94  78
3   3  46   8  96  61  75  83  58  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 3 46  8 96 61 75 83 58 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that attempts to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent should receive approximately 2 items, with one agent receiving 3 items (since the total number of items isn't evenly divisible by the number of agents).

Here is one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign item 2 (value 93)
   - Assign item 0 (value 91)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign item 8 (value 98)
   - Assign item 3 (value 95)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign item 5 (value 97)
   - Assign item 7 (value 94)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Assign item 6 (value 83)
   - Assign item 4 (value 61)
   - Assign item 1 (value 46)

This allocation ensures that every item is distributed among the agents, with the aim of maximizing the total value for each agent given the constraints. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [8, 3],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [6, 4, 1]
}
```
