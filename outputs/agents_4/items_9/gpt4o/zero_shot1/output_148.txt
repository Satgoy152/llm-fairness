Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88   0  87  55   3  56  94  66  82
1  70  73  11  52   1   2  42  87  10
2  67  36  47  99  37  62  59  41  72
3  65  53  86  74  31  21  26  92  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 3 items, and the others will receive 2 items each.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Start by looking for the highest valuations first.
    - Item 0: 88
    - Item 2: 87
    - Item 6: 94
    
2. **Agent 1**: Next, find items that maximize Agent 1's valuation without significantly reducing others' potential maximum valuations.
    - Item 7: 87
    - Item 1: 73
    
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate based on the highest remaining valuations for Agent 2.
    - Item 3: 99
    - Item 8: 72
    
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate the remaining items to Agent 3.
    - Item 4: 31
    - Item 5: 21

After these allocations, each agent has items, and all 9 items are allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
