Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  72  94  31  18  12  63   1   0
1   0  21  25  61  56  58  70  19  75
2  40  76  36  45  49  69  35  23   4
3  19  51   8  20  64  87   7  74  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable valuation of the items they receive, while also ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute items where each agent receives items they value highly. We'll aim for an allocation where the sum of values per agent is somewhat balanced.

1. **Agent 0**: Values items 0, 1, 2 highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Values items 6, 8, 5 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Values items 1, 5, 3 highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Values items 5, 7, 4 highly.

Let's consider an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2] (Values: 48, 94)
- **Agent 1**: Items [6, 8] (Values: 70, 75)
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 5] (Values: 76, 69)
- **Agent 3**: Items [3, 4, 7] (Values: 20, 64, 74)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least two items, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Now, presenting the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 4, 7]
}
```
