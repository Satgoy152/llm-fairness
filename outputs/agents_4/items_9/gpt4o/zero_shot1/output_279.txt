Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  56  67   9  33  68  33  99  10
1  44  22  88  10  23  24  71  47  41
2  95  65  44  78  48  40  74  74  77
3  62  73  44   6  35  38  70  37  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while also ensuring that all items are distributed. A common approach is to try to maximize the total satisfaction by assigning items to agents who value them the most, while keeping the distribution balanced. Let's proceed with allocating the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Values: [57, 56, 67, 9, 33, 68, 33, 99, 10]
   - Highest values: Item 7 (99), Item 5 (68)

2. Agent 1:
   - Values: [44, 22, 88, 10, 23, 24, 71, 47, 41]
   - Highest values: Item 2 (88), Item 6 (71)

3. Agent 2:
   - Values: [95, 65, 44, 78, 48, 40, 74, 74, 77]
   - Highest values: Item 0 (95), Item 3 (78)

4. Agent 3:
   - Values: [62, 73, 44, 6, 35, 38, 70, 37, 19]
   - Highest values: Item 1 (73), Item 6 (70)

Considering these preferences, we can attempt to distribute items as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 2, Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 0, Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1, Item 4, Item 5, Item 8

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, and all items are distributed. Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1, 4, 5, 8]
}
```
