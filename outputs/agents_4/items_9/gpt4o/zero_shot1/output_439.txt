Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  77  55  50  40  17  33  55  51
1  62  80  63   3  81  39  72  65   0
2  41  65  43  25  20  40  54  48   6
3   5  44  44  43  49  56  85  64   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 77 55 50 40 17 33 55 51]
 [62 80 63  3 81 39 72 65  0]
 [41 65 43 25 20 40 54 48  6]
 [ 5 44 44 43 49 56 85 64  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy where we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Since we have 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 3 items each. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive a particular item.
2. Allocate items to agents based on maximizing their total valuation while ensuring fairness.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent one high-value item based on their preferences.
2. Allocate the remaining items to balance the total valuations.

After analyzing the given valuations, the allocation can be done as follows:

- Agent 0: Allocated items 0, 1, 8
- Agent 1: Allocated items 3, 4, 7
- Agent 2: Allocated items 2, 5
- Agent 3: Allocated item 6

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6]
}
```
