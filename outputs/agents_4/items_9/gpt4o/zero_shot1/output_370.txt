Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  66  23  33  64   7  95  53  77
1   8  19  23  67  63   1   0  71  69
2  64  31   0  61  65   4  41  36  86
3  52  76  31  60  92  74   7  91  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will follow a strategy aiming to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's first evaluate the total valuation for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: \(59 + 66 + 23 + 33 + 64 + 7 + 95 + 53 + 77 = 477\)
- Agent 1: \(8 + 19 + 23 + 67 + 63 + 1 + 0 + 71 + 69 = 321\)
- Agent 2: \(64 + 31 + 0 + 61 + 65 + 4 + 41 + 36 + 86 = 388\)
- Agent 3: \(52 + 76 + 31 + 60 + 92 + 74 + 7 + 91 + 85 = 568\)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Start with the highest value items and allocate them to the agent who values them the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, to maintain fairness.

Based on this strategy:

- Item 6 (95) goes to Agent 0
- Item 4 (92) goes to Agent 3
- Item 8 (86) goes to Agent 2
- Item 3 (67) goes to Agent 1
- Item 7 (91) goes to Agent 3
- Item 1 (76) goes to Agent 3
- Item 0 (64) goes to Agent 2
- Item 5 (7) goes to Agent 0
- Item 2 (31) goes to Agent 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [8, 0],
    "3": [4, 7, 1, 2]
}
```
