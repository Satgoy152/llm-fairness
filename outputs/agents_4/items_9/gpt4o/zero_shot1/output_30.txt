Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  72  70  13  57  17  26   0  81
1  61  63  26  34  25  74  25  28   7
2  75  10  65  15   4  26  20  57  19
3   3  18  86  86  40   2  66  98   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the constraints, we will consider both the valuations and the need to distribute all 9 items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Look at the table and identify which agent values each item the most. This will help us understand the preference of each agent for specific items.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach is a good starting point to maximize individual satisfaction.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**:
   - Ensure that no agent has significantly more items than others, considering there are 9 items and 4 agents.

Starting with the highest valuations:
- Item 0: Agent 2 (75)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (72)
- Item 2: Agent 3 (86)
- Item 3: Agent 3 (86)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (57)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (74)
- Item 6: Agent 3 (66)
- Item 7: Agent 3 (98)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (81)

Initial allocation based on highest valuations:
- Agent 0: [1, 4, 8]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [2, 3, 6, 7]

Now, ensuring fairness and integer allocation:
- Agent 0 has 3 items, Agent 1 has 1 item, Agent 2 has 1 item, and Agent 3 has 4 items. This allocation respects the integer allocation constraint with a total of 9 items.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
