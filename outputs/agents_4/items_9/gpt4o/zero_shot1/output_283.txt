Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  94  68  81  35  38   8  99  74
1  92   5  60  48  11   9   7  69  73
2  40  35   6  74  22  89  71  22  46
3  57  76  14  32  40  79  98  40  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to distribute items such that each agent receives a similar total valuation. We'll do this by examining the valuations and trying to balance them as evenly as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 8.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5 and 6.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 7.

Allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3 (total valuation: 94 + 81 = 175)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 8 (total valuation: 92 + 73 = 165)
- Agent 2: Items 5, 6 (total valuation: 89 + 71 = 160)
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4, 7 (total valuation: 14 + 40 + 40 = 94)

This distribution ensures that each agent gets a roughly equivalent total valuation. Now, let's format this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 4, 7]
}
```
