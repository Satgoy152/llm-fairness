Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61   0  63  35  49   5  83  66  25
1  61  52  92   3  84  55  56  22  29
2   5  38  65  49  42  70  78  17  17
3  19  31  71  23  55   5  39  33  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items so that each agent receives items with relatively balanced total value according to their preferences. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Assigning Items:**
   - We will attempt to allocate items based on maximizing the individual agent's valuation for each item, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

2. **Considerations:**
   - Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, we could aim for each agent to receive approximately 2 items, with one agent possibly receiving 3 items.
   - The total value should be somewhat balanced among agents.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest valuations are for items 6 (83) and 2 (63).
  - Assign items 6 and 2 to agent 0.

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest valuations are for items 2 (92) and 4 (84).
  - Item 2 is already assigned, so assign item 4 to agent 1.
  - Next highest for available items is item 5 (55).
  - Assign items 4 and 5 to agent 1.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest valuations are for items 5 (70) and 6 (78).
  - Both items are assigned, so consider next highest available: item 3 (49).
  - Assign items 3 and 0 to agent 2 (since item 3 is highest available and item 0 is next).

- **Agent 3**:
  - Remaining items are 1, 7, and 8.
  - Highest valuations for available items are item 1 (31), item 7 (33).
  - Assign items 1, 7, and 8 to agent 3.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [1, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
