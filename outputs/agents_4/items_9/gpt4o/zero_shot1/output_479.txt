Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  61  44  24  21  13  65  63   0
1  54   5  39  14  74  12  92  71  98
2  57   0  80  94  44  67  91  35  90
3  44  95  93  38  35  68  93  93  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Look for items with high valuations and allocate them to the agent that values them the most.
2. **Balance Allocation**: After allocating the high-value items, ensure that each agent has at least one item if possible, or otherwise distribute the items to maintain fairness in terms of total valuation.

Here is one potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0 (Value: 94)
  - Item 6 (Value: 65)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 8 (Value: 98)
  - Item 4 (Value: 74)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 3 (Value: 94)
  - Item 2 (Value: 80)

- **Agent 3**:
  - Item 1 (Value: 95)
  - Item 5 (Value: 68)
  - Item 7 (Value: 93)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [8, 4],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [1, 5, 7]
}
```
