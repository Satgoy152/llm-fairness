Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  46  70  41  87  20  77  18  49
1   2  39  64  70  84  27  14  37  54
2  68  56  46  75  27  24  90  29  10
3  19  14  25  51  39  61  14  16  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with a greedy approach where we assign items one by one to the agent who values it the most and hasn't reached their maximum capacity of items (assuming we aim to distribute items as evenly as possible).

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 95.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 56.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 64.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 70.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 87.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 0.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 3 values it at 61.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 3.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 90.
   - Assign item 6 to agent 2.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 37.
   - Assign item 7 to agent 1.

9. **Item 8**: 
   - Agent 3 values it at 88.
   - Assign item 8 to agent 3.

Now, let's ensure each agent has an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items is 9. The distribution should be balanced as well:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 6]
- Agent 3: [5, 8]

This allocation ensures each agent has between 2 to 3 items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 7],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [5, 8]
}
```
