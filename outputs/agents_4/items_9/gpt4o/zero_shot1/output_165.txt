Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  52  68  37   6  15  15  87  15
1   5  12   1  45  81  31  77   1  36
2  97  37  26  92  55  37  71  63  96
3  42   4  79  31  92  32  95   1  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow an approach to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. One common method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a possible allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 97 by Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 52 by Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 79 by Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 92 by Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 92 by Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 37 by both Agent 2 and Agent 0. To balance allocations, assign to Agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 87 by Agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 96 by Agent 2.

After allocating based on the highest valuation and balancing the allocations, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 3, 5, 8],
    "3": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it most, and all items are allocated. Agent 1 does not receive any items as their valuations are lower than others for all items.
