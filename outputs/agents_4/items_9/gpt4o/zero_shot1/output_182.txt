Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  96  46  67  72  53   3  31  93
1  75  12  77  64  88  39  22  90  44
2  34  50  60  30  92  62  13  94  81
3  57   3  25  41  48  66   8  83  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all 9 items are distributed. One method to achieve this is to prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring that every agent gets a fair share of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: 11, 96, 46, 67, 72, 53, 3, 31, 93
- Agent 1: 75, 12, 77, 64, 88, 39, 22, 90, 44
- Agent 2: 34, 50, 60, 30, 92, 62, 13, 94, 81
- Agent 3: 57, 3, 25, 41, 48, 66, 8, 83, 12

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed:

1. Start by assigning the highest value items to each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 (96) the most.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 (88) the most.
   - Agent 2 values item 7 (94) the most.
   - Agent 3 values item 5 (66) the most.

2. Continue assigning the next highest value items:
   - Agent 0: item 8 (93)
   - Agent 1: item 2 (77)
   - Agent 2: item 4 (92)
   - Agent 3: item 7 (83)

3. Assign remaining items:
   - Agent 0: item 3 (67)
   - Agent 1: item 0 (75)
   - Agent 2: item 6 (13)
   - Agent 3: item 2 (25)

Now let's finalize the allocation ensuring all 9 items are distributed:

- Agent 0: [1, 8, 3]
- Agent 1: [4, 2, 0]
- Agent 2: [7, 6]
- Agent 3: [5]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8, 3],
    "1": [4, 2, 0],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
