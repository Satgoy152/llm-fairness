Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  20  56  10  81  13  68  12  37
1  25  77  67  44  33  62   8  70  55
2  17  76  69  33  15  94  46  52  82
3   5  48  46  44  47  86  90  28   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. There are various methods to achieve this, such as maximizing the minimum value each agent receives or using other fairness criteria. Here, we'll attempt a simple allocation that tries to balance the total value received by each agent, while considering their preferences as reflected in the valuation table.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0 because it has the highest value (81) for agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 because it has the highest value (77) for agent 1.
3. Assign item 5 to agent 2 because it has the highest value (94) for agent 2.
4. Assign item 6 to agent 3 because it has the highest value (90) for agent 3.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 2 because it has the second-highest value (69) for agent 2.
6. Assign item 0 to agent 0 because it has the second-highest value (37) for agent 0.
7. Assign item 3 to agent 3 because it has the second-highest value (44) for agent 3, and agent 1 also values it similarly.
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 because it has the second-highest value (70) for agent 1.
9. Assign item 8 to agent 0 because it will balance the allocation, as agent 0 has received relatively fewer high-value items.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 8],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [6, 3]
}
```
