Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  16  25  19   3  70  38   7  18
1  38  81  96  12  31  45  69  62  11
2  49  71  44  12  53  35   9  59  57
3  52  53  38  38  11   8  67  13  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed. Given the valuations, we can aim to distribute items so that each agent gets a fair share in terms of their preferences, though achieving perfect fairness is challenging without more sophisticated algorithms or criteria.

Here's one possible allocation that considers the agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 5 the most (70), so we'll allocate that item to them.  
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 2 the most (96), so we'll allocate that item to them.  
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 1 the most (71), so we'll allocate that item to them.  
4. **Agent 3**: They value item 6 the most (67), so we'll allocate that item to them.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Next highest value is item 6 (38), but it's already taken. Next is item 0 (28).
- Agent 1: Next highest value is item 1 (81), but it's taken. Next is item 7 (62).
- Agent 2: Next highest value is item 4 (53).
- Agent 3: Next highest value is item 0 (52), but it's taken. Next is item 3 (38).

Now, let's check each agent for remaining allocations:

- Agent 0: Items allocated are [5, 0]
- Agent 1: Items allocated are [2, 7]
- Agent 2: Items allocated are [1, 4]
- Agent 3: Items allocated are [6, 3]

The remaining item is 8, and it can go to the agent with the least total value from their current allocation:

- Agent 0: Total value = 70 + 28 = 98
- Agent 1: Total value = 96 + 62 = 158
- Agent 2: Total value = 71 + 53 = 124
- Agent 3: Total value = 67 + 38 = 105

Agent 0 has the lowest total value, so we'll allocate item 8 to them.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0, 8],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
