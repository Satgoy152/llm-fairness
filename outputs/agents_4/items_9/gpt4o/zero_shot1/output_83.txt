Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  80  82  42  52  23  16  86  87
1   0  14  26  82  56  29  89  32  30
2  29  78  19  98  21  98  32  83  66
3  75  72  67  29  68  89  90   9  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with a roughly equal number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 3 values it the most (75).
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it the most (80).
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it the most (82).
4. **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it the most (98).
5. **Item 4:** Agent 3 values it the most (68).
6. **Item 5:** Agent 2 values it the most (98).
7. **Item 6:** Agent 3 values it the most (90).
8. **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it the most (86).
9. **Item 8:** Agent 3 values it the most (98).

Now, let's check the distribution of items to ensure fairness. We need to adjust in case one agent has too many items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 7 (3 items)
- Agent 1: (0 items)
- Agent 2: Items 3, 5 (2 items)
- Agent 3: Items 0, 4, 6, 8 (4 items)

Agent 3 has one more item than others, so we will move one item from Agent 3 to Agent 1:

- **Item 0:** Move from Agent 3 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it 0, but we need to balance the allocation.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 7 (3 items)
- Agent 1: Items 0 (1 item)
- Agent 2: Items 3, 5 (2 items)
- Agent 3: Items 4, 6, 8 (3 items)

This provides a reasonable distribution, balancing the total number of items across agents while considering their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 6, 8]
}
```
