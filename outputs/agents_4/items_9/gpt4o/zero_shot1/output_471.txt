Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  72  35   0  45  99  53  99  66
1  31  78  46  46  26  93  28  86  31
2  13  94  91  44  47  14  57   3  17
3  14   7  24   6  68  30  46  37  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute all 9 items among the 4 agents. Let's consider the valuations and try to distribute the items fairly:

Let's review the valuations:
- Agent 0 values items highly: 1(72), 5(99), 7(99)
- Agent 1 values items highly: 1(78), 5(93), 7(86)
- Agent 2 values items highly: 1(94), 2(91), 4(47)
- Agent 3 values items highly: 4(68), 6(46), 8(51)

Considering high valuations and trying to distribute as evenly as possible, we can assign items as follows:
- Agent 0: Item 5 and 7 (highly valued items)
- Agent 1: Item 1 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 2 and 6
- Agent 3: Item 0, 4, and 8

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly, considering the highest valuations and spreading the items among the agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 4, 8]
}
```
