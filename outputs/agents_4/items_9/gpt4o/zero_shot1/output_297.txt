Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  50  60  51  89   5  47  88  25
1  45  14  91  22  85  38   3  72  50
2  55   7  37  31  60  56  39   7  98
3  23  41  10  89  38  81  84  80  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value, while also considering the number of items. Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Calculate Total Values**: 
   - Agent 0: \(29 + 50 + 60 + 51 + 89 + 5 + 47 + 88 + 25 = 444\)
   - Agent 1: \(45 + 14 + 91 + 22 + 85 + 38 + 3 + 72 + 50 = 420\)
   - Agent 2: \(55 + 7 + 37 + 31 + 60 + 56 + 39 + 7 + 98 = 390\)
   - Agent 3: \(23 + 41 + 10 + 89 + 38 + 81 + 84 + 80 + 88 = 534\)

2. **Allocate Items Based on Valuations**: 
   - We aim to distribute the items such that the sum of valuations is balanced among agents.

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Identify the highest value items for each agent and allocate them, ensuring all items are used and no agent is left without items.

4. **Allocate Items**:
   - Agent 0: Allocate items [4, 7] (with values 89, 88)
   - Agent 1: Allocate items [2, 8] (with values 91, 50)
   - Agent 2: Allocate items [5, 6] (with values 56, 39)
   - Agent 3: Allocate items [0, 3, 1] (with values 23, 89, 41)

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Ensure all 9 items are allocated and no item is allocated more than once.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations, with all items allocated, and no agent left without items.
