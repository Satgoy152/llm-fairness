Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  82  11  42  25   7  27  73  27
1  11  22  22   2  57  14  30  51   9
2  70  33  32  16  67  45  60  74  72
3  30  71   1  34  43  96  59  68  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. We should try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. 

Let's analyze the values and allocate based on maximizing each agent's total value:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (82), Item 7 (73), Item 3 (42)
   - Allocated items: 1, 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (57), Item 7 (51), Item 2 (22)
   - Item 7 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we choose the next highest non-allocated items.
   - Allocated items: 4, 2

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (74), Item 8 (72), Item 0 (70)
   - Item 7 is already allocated, so we choose the next highest non-allocated items.
   - Allocated items: 8, 0

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (96), Item 8 (95), Item 1 (71)
   - Items 8 and 1 are already allocated, so we choose the next highest non-allocated items.
   - Allocated items: 5, 3, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item, and all items are distributed based on maximizing the agents' valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [8, 0],
    "3": [5, 3, 6]
}
```
