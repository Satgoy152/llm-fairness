Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  24  51  10  56  74  99  51  53
1  57  62  96  31  69  68  86   8  66
2   8  79  91  43  27  27  75   3  83
3  17  82  73  70  67  46  54  11  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. **Assign items to maximize individual agent value**: Start by assigning each item to the agent that values it the highest.
2. **Adjust to ensure fair distribution**: Ensure that the total number of items allocated is 9 and each agent is considered in the allocation.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (46).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (82).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (96).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (70).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (69).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (74).
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (99).
- **Item 7**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (51).
- **Item 8**: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (98).

This initial allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items [1, 3, 8]

All 9 items are allocated, and each agent, except agent 2, has received at least one item. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 3, 8]
}
```
