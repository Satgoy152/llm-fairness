Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  10  91  78  19   1  72  30  42
1  91  73  67  43  61  89  27   8  74
2  46  33  34  11  84  44   4  16  31
3  79  91  65  64  78  14  26  76   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we'll try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will aim to balance the allocations based on the given valuations. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to the respective agents, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 9.
2. Continue by allocating items to maximize each agent's total value without exceeding the total number of items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 2 (91). Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0 (91). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 4 (84). Allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 1 (91). Allocate item 1 to agent 3.

Now, each agent has at least one item:

- Allocate item 5 to agent 1 (value 89).
- Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (value 78).
- Allocate item 7 to agent 3 (value 76).
- Allocate item 6 to agent 0 (value 72).
- Allocate item 8 to agent 1 (value 74).

This allocation results in the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 5, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has received items based on maximizing their individual values while ensuring fairness and that all items are distributed.
