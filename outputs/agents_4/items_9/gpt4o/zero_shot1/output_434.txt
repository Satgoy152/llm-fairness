Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  53  97  12  42   1  18  52  86
1  32  16   2  48  41   1   0  63  24
2  21  18   1  16  82  73   2   2  33
3  21  72  28  67  35  26  53  21  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and distribute them in a way that attempts to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's follow a strategy where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are assigned and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 99.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 72.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 97.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 67.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 82.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 73.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 53.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 63.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 86.

### Allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2, 8]
- **Agent 1**: Item [7]
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 5]
- **Agent 3**: Items [1, 3, 6]

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 3, 6]
}
```
