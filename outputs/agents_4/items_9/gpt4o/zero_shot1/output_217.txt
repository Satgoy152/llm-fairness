Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97   1  12  15  36  46  51  51   9
1  36  44  57  68  41  16  82  67  35
2  40  50  55  71  48   0  19  59  86
3  44  65  19  79  80  49  92  81  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them so that each agent receives items that maximize their valuation, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets a roughly equal share whenever possible.

Here's one potential way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Agent 0 highly values item 0 with a valuation of 97. Let's allocate this item to agent 0. Additionally, agent 0's next highest valuation is for item 6 and 7, both valued at 51. We can allocate one of these to agent 0, let's choose item 7.

2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1 highly values item 2 with a valuation of 57, and item 3 with a valuation of 68. Let's allocate these items to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2 highly values item 8 with a valuation of 86. Let's allocate item 8 to agent 2. Agent 2's next highest valuations are for items 3 (71) and 7 (59), but these are already allocated, so we'll allocate item 1 with a valuation of 50.

4. **Agent 3:** Agent 3 highly values item 6 with a valuation of 92. Let's allocate item 6 to agent 3. Agent 3's next highest valuation is for item 4 with a valuation of 80, so we'll allocate item 4 to agent 3.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [8, 1],
    "3": [6, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences as much as possible, and all items are allocated.
