Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  27  93  38  27  47  33  96  46
1   3  84  98  89   7  41  82  46  13
2  24  68  53  27  13  28  62  17  71
3  97   2   5  57  73  65  46  90  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a greedy method to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while maintaining a balance so that each agent receives roughly the same number of items. Given there are 4 agents and 9 items, each agent should ideally receive about 2 items, with one agent possibly receiving 3 items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Assign items to the agent with the highest valuation for each item, ensuring no agent receives more than 3 items:**

   - Item 0: Agent 3 (valuation: 97)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (valuation: 84)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (valuation: 98)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (valuation: 89)
   - Item 4: Agent 3 (valuation: 73)
   - Item 5: Agent 3 (valuation: 65)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (valuation: 82)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (valuation: 96)
   - Item 8: Agent 2 (valuation: 71)

2. **Check and adjust for fairness:**

   After the initial assignment, we need to ensure that no agent receives more than 3 items. We also want to balance the number of items among agents as evenly as possible. 

   In the initial assignment:
   - Agent 0 has 1 item.
   - Agent 1 has 4 items.
   - Agent 2 has 1 item.
   - Agent 3 has 3 items.

   Adjustments to balance the allocation:
   - Move Item 6 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 33, and it balances the allocation).

3. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of items with valuations that are significant to them, while ensuring all 9 items are allocated.
