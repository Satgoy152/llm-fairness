Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  87   3  36  96  26   7  98  45
1  66  62  49  79  57  98  12  53   9
2  83   4  61  35  38  91  86  40  41
3   7  62  16  57  56  84   3   2  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and only 9 items are allocated in total. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (98), Item 7 (98)
   - Allocate: [0, 7]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (98), Item 3 (79)
   - Allocate: [5, 3]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (86), Item 2 (61)
   - Allocate: [6, 2]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (84), Item 3 (57) - Since these items are already allocated, consider next highest available: Item 1 (62), Item 4 (56)
   - Allocate: [1, 4]

Now let's check if all items are allocated:
- Allocated items: [0, 7, 5, 3, 6, 2, 1, 4]
- Remaining item: 8

Let's allocate the remaining item 8 to the agent with the least total valuation from their currently assigned items to balance the allocation:
- Agent 0: Total value = 98 (Item 0) + 98 (Item 7) = 196
- Agent 1: Total value = 98 (Item 5) + 79 (Item 3) = 177
- Agent 2: Total value = 86 (Item 6) + 61 (Item 2) = 147
- Agent 3: Total value = 62 (Item 1) + 56 (Item 4) = 118

Assign item 8 to Agent 3, as they have the least valuation total from their current items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [1, 4, 8]
}
```
