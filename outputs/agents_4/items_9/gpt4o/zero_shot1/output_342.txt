Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  96  47  47  35  60  63  10  65
1  52  28  82  36  84  72  11  87  28
2  66  20  57   5  19  28  47  84  50
3  44  16  62  73  20  14  19  51  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent's allocation. One straightforward approach is to consider each agent's highest-valued items and ensure every agent receives at least one item, while keeping the overall allocation balanced.

Let's analyze the values and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest values: 96 (items 0 and 1), 65 (item 8)
   - Allocation: [0, 1, 8]

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest values: 87 (item 7), 84 (item 4), 82 (item 2)
   - Allocation: [2, 4]

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest values: 84 (item 7), 66 (item 0)
   - Allocation: [7]

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest values: 73 (item 3), 62 (item 2)
   - Allocation: [3, 5, 6]

However, item 2 is allocated to both agents 1 and 3 in this case. Let's adjust the allocations to ensure each item is assigned to only one agent:

Here's a revised allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Allocation: [0, 1] (Total valuation = 96 + 96 = 192)

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Allocation: [4, 8] (Total valuation = 84 + 28 = 112)

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Allocation: [7] (Total valuation = 84)

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Allocation: [2, 3, 5, 6] (Total valuation = 62 + 73 + 14 + 19 = 168)

Now we ensure that all items 0 to 8 are allocated, and every agent has at least one item. The allocation respects the integer constraint and fairly distributes the items based on each agent's valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation is balanced in terms of ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and every item is allocated.
