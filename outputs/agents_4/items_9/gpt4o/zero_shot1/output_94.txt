Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2   4   3  65   2  96  23  33  72
1  34   9  31   8  90   0  32  78  77
2  87  99  74   5  61  11   3  21  57
3  96   1  82  78  54  57  89  60  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent has a reasonable share based on their valuations. Given there are 4 agents and 9 items, each agent should ideally get around 2 to 3 items. Let's try to balance the allocations by considering the valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items that Agent 0 values relatively high compared to others.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that Agent 1 values uniquely high compared to others.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items that Agent 2 values uniquely high compared to others.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items that Agent 3 values uniquely high, and also remaining items to balance the number.

By considering the valuations, here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3 (65) and 5 (96)
- **Agent 1**: Items 4 (90) and 8 (77)
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 (87), 1 (99), and 2 (74)
- **Agent 3**: Items 6 (89) and 7 (60)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 2],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations, while ensuring that all 9 items are allocated.
