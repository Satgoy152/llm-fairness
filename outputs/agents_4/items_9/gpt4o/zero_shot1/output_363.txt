Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  99  81   6  61   8  22  26  62
1   9  90  22  63  33  78  43  76  35
2  81  43  85  14  11  13  48  73  79
3  51  15   2  51   0  66  23  34  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value.

Let's start by evaluating the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 89 + 99 + 81 + 6 + 61 + 8 + 22 + 26 + 62 = 454
- Agent 1: 9 + 90 + 22 + 63 + 33 + 78 + 43 + 76 + 35 = 449
- Agent 2: 81 + 43 + 85 + 14 + 11 + 13 + 48 + 73 + 79 = 447
- Agent 3: 51 + 15 + 2 + 51 + 0 + 66 + 23 + 34 + 16 = 258

Next, we will assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item, while ensuring a fair distribution:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 89)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 99)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation: 85)
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation: 63)
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 61)
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest valuation: 78)
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (highest valuation: 48)
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (highest valuation: 76)
9. Assign item 8 to Agent 2 (highest valuation: 79)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 6, 8],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while attempting to maintain a fair distribution based on their preferences.
