Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  53  20  15  92  82  74   8  54
1  27  74  21  21  62  94  18  75  76
2  81  98  48  67  85  33  72  63  59
3   5  64  14   3  36  39   1  23  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. One approach is to use a method that maximizes the total valuation for all agents while ensuring everyone gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for item 5.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
4. Agent 3 has relatively low valuations but is the highest for item 7 compared to others.

Given these observations, let's allocate items to maximize the total valuation:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Assign item 5
- Agent 2: Assign items 1 and 2
- Agent 3: Assign item 7
- Now, assign remaining items (3, 6, 8) based on the highest available valuation:
  - Item 6: Agent 0 (highest valuation among remaining)
  - Item 3: Agent 2 (highest valuation among remaining)
  - Item 8: Agent 1 (highest valuation among remaining)

Now, let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 3],
    "3": [7]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest preference of each agent while distributing all items fairly.
