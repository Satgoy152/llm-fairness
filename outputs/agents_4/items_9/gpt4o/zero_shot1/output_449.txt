Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  29  72  61  49  81  47   5  41
1   5  83  30  90  16  37  12  77  51
2  18   4  44  58  25  45   2  83  46
3  61  64  86  32   4  20  28  11  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. **Evaluating Total Valuations for Each Agent:**  
   Calculate the sum of valuations for each agent to understand their overall preferences.

   - Agent 0: 50 + 29 + 72 + 61 + 49 + 81 + 47 + 5 + 41 = 435
   - Agent 1: 5 + 83 + 30 + 90 + 16 + 37 + 12 + 77 + 51 = 401
   - Agent 2: 18 + 4 + 44 + 58 + 25 + 45 + 2 + 83 + 46 = 325
   - Agent 3: 61 + 64 + 86 + 32 + 4 + 20 + 28 + 11 + 42 = 348

2. **Allocating Items Based on Valuations:**  
   We will assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated. Priority is given to agents with fewer items in case of ties.

   - Item 0: Highest value by Agent 0 (50)
   - Item 1: Highest value by Agent 1 (83)
   - Item 2: Highest value by Agent 3 (86)
   - Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (90)
   - Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (49)
   - Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (81)
   - Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (47)
   - Item 7: Highest value by Agent 2 (83)
   - Item 8: Highest value by Agent 1 (51)

3. **Ensuring Fair Distribution:**  
   We check the distribution to ensure each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items is 9.

   After the initial allocation based on highest valuations:

   - Agent 0: [0, 4, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1: [1, 3, 8]
   - Agent 2: [7]
   - Agent 3: [2]

   Each agent has at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.

4. **Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that reflects their preferences as much as possible, while also maintaining a fair distribution among all agents.
