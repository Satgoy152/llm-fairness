Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  42   4  82  94  39  91  86  14
1  37  97  96  70  82  16  97  52  73
2  75   2  55  20  24  79  43  27  19
3  17  63  28  17  54  28  81  92  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by the agents and aim to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation for each agent. One way to do this is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest with 75. Assign it to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the highest with 97. Assign it to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest with 96. Assign it to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the highest with 82. Assign it to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the highest with 94. Assign it to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the highest with 79. Assign it to Agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 and Agent 0 both value it equally at 97 and 91, respectively. To balance the allocations, assign it to Agent 3, who currently has no items.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the highest with 92. Assign it to Agent 3.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it the highest with 73, but to ensure fair distribution and that each agent has at least one item, assign it to Agent 2.

Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 5, 8],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on the valuations, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
