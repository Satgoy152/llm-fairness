Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62   2  38  78  27  45   8  51  87
1  13  27  80  35   4  75  59  86  30
2  46  44  43  50  37  62  59  51  62
3  47  56  30  75  13  28  20  28   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no items are left unallocated. Here’s a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 3 and 8, which are valued at 78 and 87 respectively.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 highly at 80 and item 7 at 86.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a balanced valuation across the board but has a higher valuation for items 5 and 8, both valued at 62.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has a high valuation for item 3 at 75 and item 1 at 56.

Let’s allocate the items based on these observations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 8
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 5 and 6
- **Agent 3**: Items 0, 1, and 4

Now, let’s present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents while attempting to give each agent items they value highly.
