Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  25  92  64  78  44  64  56  49
1  37   2  91  16  38  60  24  61  58
2  71  96  92  92  36  45  56  49  13
3  19  43  78  50  25  69  38  47  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives. We will try to allocate items such that each agent gets a roughly equal share of their maximum possible value.

Here, we'll evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (92), Item 4 (78), Item 0 (66)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (91), Item 7 (61), Item 5 (60)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (96), Item 2 (92), Item 3 (92)
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (69), Item 2 (78), Item 3 (50)

Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive about 2 items, with one agent receiving 3 items.

Let's allocate based on the highest values first, ensuring each agent gets a balanced allocation:

- **Allocate items to Agent 2** (as they have high values for multiple items):
  - Item 1 (96), Item 3 (92)
  
- **Allocate items to Agent 0**:
  - Item 2 (92), Item 4 (78)
  
- **Allocate items to Agent 1**:
  - Item 5 (60), Item 7 (61)
  
- **Allocate items to Agent 3**:
  - Item 0 (19), Item 8 (12)

Now, we have allocated 8 items. Assign the remaining item 6 to the agent with the least value allocated so far:

- **Assign item 6 to Agent 3** (to balance the allocation further):

Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0, 6, 8]
}
```
