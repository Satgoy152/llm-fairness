Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20   1  10  58  20  36  70   3  66
1  70  83  26  20  49  24  28  39   2
2  41  33  83  47  20  28  67  97  18
3  63  57  46  94  47  30  71  77  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations and ensuring that each agent gets roughly an equal share of total value, given the constraint of 9 items and 4 agents.

First, we will calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to get a sense of their overall preferences:

- Agent 0 total value: \(20 + 1 + 10 + 58 + 20 + 36 + 70 + 3 + 66 = 284\)
- Agent 1 total value: \(70 + 83 + 26 + 20 + 49 + 24 + 28 + 39 + 2 = 341\)
- Agent 2 total value: \(41 + 33 + 83 + 47 + 20 + 28 + 67 + 97 + 18 = 434\)
- Agent 3 total value: \(63 + 57 + 46 + 94 + 47 + 30 + 71 + 77 + 45 = 530\)

Next, we allocate items by considering each agent's highest-valued items, ensuring that each agent gets at least some items while maximizing their individual satisfaction.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 6, 8, and 3.
   - Allocate items: 6 (70), 8 (66), 3 (58)

2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 1, 0, and 4.
   - Allocate items: 1 (83), 0 (70)

3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 7, 2, and 6 (already taken by Agent 0).
   - Allocate items: 7 (97), 2 (83)

4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 3 (already taken by Agent 0), 7 (already taken by Agent 2), and 5.
   - Allocate items: 5 (30), 4 (47)

### Allocations:

We need to ensure that all 9 items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations, while also respecting the constraint of distributing all 9 items.
