Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  98  68  23  15  73  73  77  52
1  14  16  48  98  95  84  96  47  30
2  36  18  16  66  65  65  56  35  57
3  30  33  60  16  57  63  35  99  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to allocate items to agents to maximize their total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. Start by assigning the item with the highest valuation to the agent who values it the most:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 98.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 68.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 84.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
   - Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most at 99.
   - Item 8: Agent 3 values it the most at 82.

2. Now, compile the allocations into the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent who values it highly, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
