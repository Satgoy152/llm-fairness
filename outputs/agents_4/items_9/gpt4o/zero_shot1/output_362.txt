Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  90  71   3  94  63  14  61  59
1   7  79  90  16  92  24  81   7  35
2  36  66  16  92  34   3  89  11  94
3  86  84  11  60  35  50  53  48   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to balance the overall satisfaction across all agents. One approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total value while ensuring a fair distribution.

Let's start by analyzing the potential allocations:

1. Calculate the total value an agent would receive if they were given specific items.
2. Distribute the items to the agents such that each agent receives a balanced total value.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2
- Agent 2 receives items: 3, 8
- Agent 3 receives items: 5, 6, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the total value based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
