Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71   0  57  12  64  86  91  40  46
1   5  60  16  94   6  53  40  59  49
2  12  13  97  69  57  30   8  18   1
3  43  59  75  58  93  51  46  83  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can try to allocate items in a way that tries to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. We can do this by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuation, while also trying to ensure that agents get a similar number of items where possible. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, starting with the highest valued items.
2. If an agent has too many items, consider reallocating them to ensure each agent gets a fair share.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 71.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 60.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most at 93.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most at 83.
- Item 8: Agent 3 values it the most at 71.

Now, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5, 6 (3 items)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3 (2 items)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (1 item)
- Agent 3: Items 4, 7, 8 (3 items)

This distribution seems balanced given the constraints. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 7, 8]
}
```
