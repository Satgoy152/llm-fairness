Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  19  33  28  17  34  27  80  33
1  58  28  63  99  71  50  80   6  79
2  81   9  59  58  53  94  58  55  48
3  72  21  22  89  28  39  85  37  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's consider each agent's highest-valued items, attempting to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values for Agent 0 are for items 7 (80), 0 (56), and 5 (34).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values for Agent 1 are for items 3 (99), 6 (80), and 2 (63).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values for Agent 2 are for items 5 (94), 0 (81), and 2 (59).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values for Agent 3 are for items 8 (91), 3 (89), and 6 (85).
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 3.

5. **Revisiting remaining items:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (81).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 (85).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (63).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (19).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (71).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [3, 2, 4],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [8, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations and all items are distributed.
