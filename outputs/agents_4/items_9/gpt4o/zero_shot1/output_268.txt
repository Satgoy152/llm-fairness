Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  74  73  58  99   6   6  86  58
1  17   3  78  25  74  25  41  97  33
2   4  41  94  56  94  11   0  42   5
3  79  27  25  98  41  50  17  25  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated without exceeding the total count of 9 items.

One potential approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring fairness in the distribution:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - 4th item (99)
   - 7th item (86)
   - 1st item (74)
   
2. Agent 1 values:
   - 7th item (97)
   - 4th item (74)
   - 2nd item (78)

3. Agent 2 values:
   - 2nd item (94)
   - 4th item (94)
   - 3rd item (56)

4. Agent 3 values:
   - 3rd item (98)
   - 0th item (79)
   - 5th item (50)

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent, while ensuring each item is only allocated once:

- Agent 0: [4, 7] (99, 86)
- Agent 1: [1] (74)
- Agent 2: [2] (94)
- Agent 3: [3, 0, 5, 6, 8] (98, 79, 50, 17, 22)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 0, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents, with each item being assigned exactly once.
