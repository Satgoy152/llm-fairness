Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  86  21  42  41  73  22  67  85
1  83  77  75  88  10  29  88   1  58
2   7  47  36  99  24  29  60  46  13
3  14  15  63  71  76  96  26  64   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent seems to have high values for items 0, 1, and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 3 and 6.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 3 the highest, but since it's already taken, we can consider item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values items 5 and 4 highly.

Based on these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 8
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 6
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 7
- Agent 3: Items 4 and 5

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
