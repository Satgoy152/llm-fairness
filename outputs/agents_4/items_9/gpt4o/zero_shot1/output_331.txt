Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  33  76  53  69  11  57  28  13
1  38   5  93  62  70  38  83  45  21
2  58  97  58   3  98  72  76   7  74
3  61  30  59  33  28  23   9  84  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 33 76 53 69 11 57 28 13]
 [38  5 93 62 70 38 83 45 21]
 [58 97 58  3 98 72 76  7 74]
 [61 30 59 33 28 23  9 84 48]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can try to allocate items such that each agent receives approximately equal total valuation. Given the valuations from the table, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (76), Item 4 (69), Item 0 (65)
   - Allocate: Item 2, Item 4

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (93), Item 6 (83), Item 4 (70)
   - Item 2 already taken, allocate: Item 6, Item 4

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 1 (97), Item 5 (72)
   - Item 4 already taken, allocate: Item 1, Item 5

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (84), Item 0 (61), Item 8 (48)
   - Allocate: Item 7, Item 0

Now, we have allocated 8 items. We need to allocate 1 more item to complete the total of 9 items:

- Remaining items: Item 3, Item 8
- Agent 0 has only 1 item allocated, allocate: Item 3

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [7, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable distribution of items based on their valuations.
