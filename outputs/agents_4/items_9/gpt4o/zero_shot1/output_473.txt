Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  76   7  92  18  54  25  57  41
1  76  60  10   1  92  97  74  15  99
2  40  21  52  71  62  47  45  20  96
3  11  79   0  82  11  76  77  59  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an approximately equal number of items. Here's a possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with the highest values: 3 (92), 1 (76), 5 (54)
   - Allocate items 3, 1, and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items with the highest values: 8 (99), 5 (97), 4 (92)
   - Allocate items 8, 4, and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items with the highest values: 8 (96), 3 (71), 4 (62)
   - Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items with the highest values: 1 (79), 5 (76), 6 (77)
   - Since items 1, 5, and 6 are already allocated, allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Given the above process, we can summarize the allocations as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 5],
    "1": [8, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with each agent receiving at least one item.
