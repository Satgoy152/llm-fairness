Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  72  93   8  72  90  76  55  24
1  35  68  45  49  31  39  52  73  91
2  80  21   1  86  56  66  29  34  88
3  32  42  11  27  79  19  38  22  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Given there are 9 items and 4 agents, we'll try to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately 2-3 items.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: They have high valuations for items 0, 2, and 5. Allocating items 0, 2, and 5 to Agent 0 gives them values of 76, 93, and 90, respectively.
- Agent 1: They have relatively high valuations for items 1 and 8. Allocating items 1 and 8 to Agent 1 gives them values of 68 and 91, respectively.
- Agent 2: They have high valuations for items 3, 4, and 6. Allocating these items to Agent 2 gives them values of 86, 56, and 29, respectively.
- Agent 3: They have high valuations for item 7. Allocating item 7 to Agent 3 gives them a value of 22.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [3, 4, 6],
    "3": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
