Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  38  88  31  61  44  29  42  94
1  29  19  72  40  47   2  68  37  70
2  72  10  51  22  35  45   8  83  29
3  68  84  69  63  59  96   6  91   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their given valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 8.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2, but it's already allocated; item 8 is also favorable.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0, but it's already allocated; item 7 is the next high.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1, 3, 5, and 7. 

Considering this, here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Items 7
- Agent 3: Items 1, 4, 5, 8

This way, each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their valuations.
