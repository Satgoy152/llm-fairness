Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  39  69  17  91  86  91  88  74
1  94  92  71  60  48  50  50  50  45
2  55  91  15  73  79  40  23  21  36
3  96  15   7  57  53  29   9  57  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items with the total allocation equaling 9. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 4, 6, 7, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 1 and reasonable valuations for items 3 and 4.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 0 and reasonable valuations for item 3.

Considering these, we can propose an allocation that attempts to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring fairness and that each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Give **Agent 0** items 4, 6, and 7. 
- Give **Agent 1** items 0 and 1.
- Give **Agent 2** items 3 and 5.
- Give **Agent 3** items 2 and 8.

This allocation gives each agent items they value reasonably well and distributes all 9 items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2, 8]
}
```
