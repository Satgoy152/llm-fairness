Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  71  22  51  91  13  68  82  31
1  49  45  49  71  50  24  52  50  75
2  81  57  55  94  48  40  83  53  84
3  60  69  53  20  23  52  33  19  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (since there are fewer agents than items). This problem can be thought of as a type of assignment problem where each agent should have a reasonably balanced share of the total value.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items and then allocate the items to balance these values:

1. Calculate total value for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 524
   - Agent 1: 465
   - Agent 2: 595
   - Agent 3: 401

2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's share of their total valuation:

- Assign items based on maximizing individual agent valuations, ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation strategy that balances the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 8
- Agent 2: Items 3, 6, 7
- Agent 3: Items 1, 5

Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [3, 6, 7],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total values based on their preferences.
