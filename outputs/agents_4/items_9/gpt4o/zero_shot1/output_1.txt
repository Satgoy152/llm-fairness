Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  46  79  45  23  31   2  53  40
1  53  26  43  56  35  30  49  98  94
2  90  48  60  13  15  36  10  16  38
3  96  37  85  40   0  36  66  43  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One possible way to do this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how it could be done:

1. Examine each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.
3. Verify that exactly 9 items are allocated in total.

Here is the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most with 96.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most with 46.
3. Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most with 85.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most with 56.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most with 35.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most with 36.
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most with 66.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most with 98.
9. Item 8: Agent 3 values it the most with 99.

After assigning items based on the highest valuation, we can present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 2, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
