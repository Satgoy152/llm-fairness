Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  36  90  44   4  96  41  19  89
1  68  71  62  29  58  68  38   8  27
2  24  37  10   8   1  60  95  55  80
3  37  37  61   4  36  47  63  65  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim for a distribution that considers each agent's valuation of the items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 3 items, and the others will receive 2 items each.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 highest (96), followed by item 2 (90) and item 8 (89).
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highest (71), followed by item 0 (68) and item 5 (68).
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 6 highest (95), followed by item 8 (80) and item 5 (60).
   
4. **Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 values item 6 highest (63), followed by item 7 (65) and item 2 (61).

Considering the above valuations and ensuring no item is double-allocated:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 since it is the highest valuation for this agent.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it is the highest valuation for this agent.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it is the highest valuation for this agent.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3, as it is the highest available valuation.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since it is the next highest valuation for this agent.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 for valuation balance.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3 as it balances the allocations and maximizes their valuation.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 for valuation balance.
- Finally, assign item 4 to Agent 2 to complete the allocation.

Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [7, 3, 8]
}
```

Each agent has an integer number of items, and all 9 items have been allocated.
