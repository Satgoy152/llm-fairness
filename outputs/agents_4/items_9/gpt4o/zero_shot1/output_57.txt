Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  47  76  14  27  85   4  78  72
1  49  26   7  86  63  82  66  33  17
2  71  36  62  80  64  45  53  95  38
3  95  45  48  14  55  14  12  15  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We will consider each agent's preference for the items and distribute them accordingly.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 7. We will allocate items 0 and 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 highly, so we will allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 3 and 7. Since item 3 is already allocated, we will allocate item 7 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0 and 8, but since item 0 is already allocated, we will allocate item 8 to agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 1, 2, 4, and 6. We will distribute these to agents considering their remaining valuations to balance the total value each agent receives.

5. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 to agent 0, as it's their next highest preference.
6. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 to agent 1 to balance their total valuation.
7. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 6 to agent 2, as it's a relatively high valuation for them.
8. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1 to agent 3 as it offers a reasonable balance of total value.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [8, 1]
}
```

This distribution aims to fairly allocate the items while considering the agents' valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
