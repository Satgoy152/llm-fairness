Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  39  53  44  53   4  52  13  13
1  17  13   3  21  55  54  74  40  11
2  59  28  66  48  81  87  93  36  22
3  38  35  42  62  60  29  46  39  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [38 35 42 62 60 29 46 39 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, since we have a total of 9 items and 4 agents. Letâ€™s analyze the table to determine an allocation strategy.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest single valuation for an item: 93 for item 6. Assign **item 6** to agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 2: 53. Assign **item 2** to agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 5: 54. Assign **item 5** to agent 1.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 8: 81. Assign **item 8** to agent 3.

Now, each agent has at least one item. We have allocated 4 items so far, so we need to allocate 5 more items.

5. Consider the remaining unallocated items: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7.

- **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 4: 81. Assign **item 4** to agent 2.
- **Agent 1** has a considerable valuation for item 7: 40. Assign **item 7** to agent 1.
- **Agent 3** has a good valuation for item 3: 62. Assign **item 3** to agent 3.
- **Agent 0** has a good valuation for item 0: 15. Assign **item 0** to agent 0.
- The last item, **item 1**, is assigned to **agent 0** as they have a reasonable valuation of 39 for it.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences and the total number of items is exactly 9.
