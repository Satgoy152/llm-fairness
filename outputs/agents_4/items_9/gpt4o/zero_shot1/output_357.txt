Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  83  44  19  68  39  34  17  36
1  21  52  22  26  19   8  73  50  99
2  78  64  74  41   8  40  33  42  69
3  46  75  98  96  84  76  74  91  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of the items, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to approach this allocation problem:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Look at each agent's valuations and find items they value the most.
2. **Allocate Items Strategically**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item they value highly, while distributing the rest to balance overall satisfaction.

Let's look at the values again and allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 1 (83), 4 (68).
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 8 (99), 6 (73).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 0 (78), 2 (74).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 2 (98), 3 (96).

Given these preferences, we can try the following allocation to ensure fairness and maximize happiness:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 4]
  - Item 1 (83), Item 4 (68)
- **Agent 1**: [8, 6]
  - Item 8 (99), Item 6 (73)
- **Agent 2**: [0, 5]
  - Item 0 (78), Item 5 (40)
- **Agent 3**: [2, 3, 7]
  - Item 2 (98), Item 3 (96), Item 7 (91)

This distribution tries to give each agent some of the items they value highly. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [8, 6],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2, 3, 7]
}
```
