Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  51  94  50  77  27   1  37   1
1  77  12  69  76  99  75  23  17  71
2  22  82  68  69  81  80  72  27  46
3  87  57  63  68  81   5  92  29  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's preferences based on their valuations and try to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 4, and 3. We can allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as it has the highest value for them.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4. We can allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
- After these allocations, we need to distribute the remaining items 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

To continue:
- Agent 0 can also be given item 3, as it has a relatively high value for them.
- Agent 1 can take item 5, which they value significantly compared to other agents.
- Agent 2 can be assigned item 7.
- Agent 3 can be given item 6, which they value the most among the remaining items.
- Finally, item 8 can be allocated to Agent 0 as it balances out the items and maintains some level of fairness based on their valuations.

The resulting allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 8],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution considers agents' preferences based on their valuations.
