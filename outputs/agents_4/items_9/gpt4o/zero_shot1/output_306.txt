Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  68  79  14  63  66  50  97  96
1  28  44  63   7  67  71  80  30  30
2  96   1  19  55  75  94  60  28  44
3  54  71  50  60  72  94  82   1  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items among the agents in such a way that the total valuation across all agents is maximized.

Let's examine the possible allocations by considering the highest value items for each agent and distribute them accordingly:

1. Agent 0 has the highest values for items 7 (97) and 8 (96).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 6 (80).
3. Agent 2 has high values for items 0 (96), 5 (94), and 4 (75).
4. Agent 3 has high values for items 5 (94), 8 (97), and 4 (72).

A potential allocation is as follows:

- Assign items 7 and 8 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 0 and 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign items 1, 2, 3, and 4 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their highest preferences and tries to maximize the total valuation:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 8
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: Items 1, 2, 3, 4

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
