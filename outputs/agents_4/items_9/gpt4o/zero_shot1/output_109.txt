Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  21  17  41  67  63  65  76  48
1  81  84  92  75  99  50  39  74  13
2  77  52  87  34  75  73  86  89  83
3  43  14   0  74  46  17  39  43  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but fairness can be maintained by considering their valuations.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: [1, 6]
   - Valuations: 21, 65
   - Total value: 86

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: [2, 4, 5]
   - Valuations: 92, 99, 50
   - Total value: 241

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items: [7, 8]
   - Valuations: 89, 83
   - Total value: 172

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items: [0, 3]
   - Valuations: 43, 74
   - Total value: 117

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, maximizing their satisfaction given the constraint of 9 items.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
