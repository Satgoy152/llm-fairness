Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  61  14  17  34  33  19  40  78
1  84  24  79  19  26  15  73  61  37
2  36  24  33  64  27  87  26  26  44
3  91  43  72  60  36  15  77  69  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while also ensuring that the distribution is as balanced as possible. Given that there are 4 agents and 9 items, a fair allocation could be to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives either 2 or 3 items.

Below is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0 (value 51), 1 (value 61), 8 (value 78)
   - Total value: 51 + 61 + 78 = 190

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 2 (value 79), 7 (value 61)
   - Total value: 79 + 61 = 140

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 5 (value 87), 6 (value 26)
   - Total value: 87 + 26 = 113

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: 3 (value 60), 4 (value 36)
   - Total value: 60 + 36 = 96

This allocation seeks to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations and ensures all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
