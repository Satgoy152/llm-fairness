Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  21   4   0  58  56  39  51  72
1  97  81  62   9  79  39  21  97  45
2  87  11  19  22  80  83  53  98  66
3  82  14  55  62  65  71  79  98  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 81 62  9 79 39 21 97 45]

 [82 14 55 62 65 71 79 98 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, then allocate the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item first:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (value 90)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (value 97) - since item 0 is already taken, assign the next highest, which is item 7 (value 97)
   - Agent 2: Item 7 (value 98) - since item 7 is already taken, assign the next highest, which is item 5 (value 83)
   - Agent 3: Item 7 (value 98) - since item 7 is already taken, assign the next highest, which is item 5 (value 71) - but item 5 is taken, so next is item 6 (value 79)

2. Allocate the remaining items to maximize total valuation while ensuring fairness:
   - Agent 0: Item 8 (value 72)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (value 79)
   - Agent 2: Item 6 (value 53)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 (value 62), Item 2 (value 55), Item 1 (value 14)

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [7, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 2, 1]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 2, 1]
}
```
