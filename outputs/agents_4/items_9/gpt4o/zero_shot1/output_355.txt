Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  65  22   1  79  59   6  77  18
1  61  84  64  65  51  13  76  86  65
2  75  45  28  17  90  68  59  41  13
3  21  22  51  79  32  58  65  44  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are assigned. A common approach is to use a greedy method, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate and perform the allocation:

1. Identify the highest value for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

Let's perform this allocation step-by-step:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 2 (75).
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 1 (84).
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (64).
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 3 (79).
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 2 (90).
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 2 (68).
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 1 (76).
- Item 7: Highest value by Agent 1 (86).
- Item 8: Highest value by Agent 0 (18).

Now, let's check the allocations and ensure all agents have an integer number of items:

1. Agent 0: Item 8
2. Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 6, 7
3. Agent 2: Items 0, 4, 5
4. Agent 3: Item 3

Each agent has been allocated an integer number of items, and all items are assigned.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [1, 2, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
