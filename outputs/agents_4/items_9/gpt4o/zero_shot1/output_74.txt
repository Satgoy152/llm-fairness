Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  72  59   5  20  95  59  30  69
1  98  57  50  63  80  36  32  90  84
2  34  74  33  95  63  80  32  90  64
3  24  43  81  39  21  26  71  45  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and that the total number of items allocated is 9. Let's approach this allocation step-by-step:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item**: We begin by determining which agent values each item the most. This approach ensures that items are assigned in a way that maximizes total satisfaction.

2. **Allocate items based on preferences**:
    - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
    - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 74.
    - Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 81.
    - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
    - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 80.
    - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
    - Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 71.
    - Item 7: Agents 1 and 2 both value it at 90. We can assign it to Agent 1 to balance allocations.
    - Item 8: Agents 1 and 2 both value it highly at 84 and 64, respectively. We can assign it to Agent 1 to balance allocations.

3. **Balance allocation**: Ensure that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items is 9. Adjust allocations if necessary to maintain fairness.

Applying the above steps, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 4, 7, 8],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.
