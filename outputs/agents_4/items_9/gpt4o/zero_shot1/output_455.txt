Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  43  21   7  58  87   5   0  43
1  92  64   2  10  51  13   8  37  40
2  69  25  79  52  64  65  82  86   1
3  47  67  56  28  82  96  53   8  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly.
   - Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 4 and 5.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly.
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2, 6, and 7.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocate items that Agent 3 values highly.
   - Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3 and 8.

Given these considerations, a possible allocation of items to agents is:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6, 7
- Agent 3: Items 3, 8

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 6, 7],
    "3": [3, 8]
}
```
