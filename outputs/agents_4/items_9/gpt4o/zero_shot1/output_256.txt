Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  24   9  12  20  89  32  12  29
1  72  42   0  24  76   3  96  41  29
2  73  69  39  14  99  62  27   5   3
3  99  26  11  55  28  76  39  72  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (98), 5 (89).
   - Allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (96), 4 (76).
   - Allocate items 6 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valued items: 4 (99), 1 (69).
   - Item 4 is already taken by Agent 1, so we consider the next highest valued item.
   - Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (99), 7 (72).
   - Item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Allocate items 7 and 3 to Agent 3.

Finally, we need to allocate the last item (8). Since Agent 2 didn't receive their highest valued item initially, we allocate item 8 to Agent 2, as it increases their total valuation without reducing fairness significantly.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 8],
    "3": [7, 3]
}
```
