Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  74   0  23   3  36  24  77   0
1  32  81  28  63  81  25  20  99  28
2  90  88   8  61  99   6  61  73  99
3  17  79  73   7  55  72  31  73  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We will give Agent 0 items 0 and 7. These items have high values for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: We will give Agent 1 item 1. This item has the highest value for Agent 1, and we want to ensure each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Agent 2**: We will give Agent 2 items 4, 8, and 2. These items have high values for Agent 2, especially items 4 and 8.

4. **Agent 3**: We will give Agent 3 items 3, 5, and 6. These items have reasonable values for Agent 3, and this allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 8, 2],
    "3": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
