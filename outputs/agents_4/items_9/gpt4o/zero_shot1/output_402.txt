Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  64  52  10  83  67  75  87  68
1  88  47  17  69  17  21   3  91  71
2  31  97  88  55  27  81  74  90  15
3   0  31  37  19  75  41   7  40  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a satisfying allocation based on their valuations. We have 4 agents and 9 items to distribute, meaning at least one agent will receive fewer items than the others. 

One approach is to allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring fairness. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation on items 4 and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation on items 0 and 7.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation on items 1 and 2.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation on items 4 and 5.

Let's distribute the items:

- Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent where possible.
- Avoid assigning an item to more than one agent.
- Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 6] (total value: 64 + 75 = 139)
- **Agent 1**: [0, 8] (total value: 88 + 71 = 159)
- **Agent 2**: [2, 3, 7] (total value: 88 + 55 + 90 = 233)
- **Agent 3**: [4, 5] (total value: 75 + 41 = 116)

Now, to present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [2, 3, 7],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation is one way to distribute the items while considering the agents' valuations and ensuring each item is allocated once.
