Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  58  28  16  32   1  41  60  22
1  30  20  25  52  11  81  44  53  65
2  18  12  14  17  75  58  19  56  74
3  97   5  13  96  98  16  54  86  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given that there are 9 items and 4 agents, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least 2 items, with one agent receiving 3 items, or in a similar balanced way.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (58), 7 (60)
   - Allocate items: 1, 7 

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (81), 8 (65)
   - Allocate items: 5, 8

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 4 (75), 8 (74), but 8 is already taken, so consider: 6 (19)
   - Allocate items: 4, 6

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 4 (98), but 4 is already taken, consider: 3 (96), 0 (97)
   - Allocate items: 0, 3

Now, all items except item 2 are allocated. Let's distribute the remaining item:

- **Agent 2**: Can take item 2 (14), as it needs another item.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [4, 6, 2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, with each agent getting at least two items, and one agent receiving three to account for the total of 9 items.
