Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  25  78  72  85  11  27  56  56
1  42  10  17  39   9  19  21  93  98
2  87  70  26   0  89  77   2  40  61
3  90  43  94  83  26  74  87  93  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One possible approach is to allocate the items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items, while also considering that each agent should receive at least one item, if possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items 2 (value 78), 4 (value 85), 0 (value 67)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items 7 (value 93), 8 (value 98)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items 5 (value 77), 6 (value 2)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items 1 (value 43), 3 (value 83)

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed, providing each agent with items they value highly, while ensuring an integer number of items per agent:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 0],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation method provides a balance between fairness and maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
