Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  64  83  66  30  81  68  47  52
1  49  44  47  52  30  50  71  66  47
2   5  13   3  47  43  34   8  29  27
3  63  48  13  34  94  20  42  43  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value of the items, while also ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Let's look at the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 94 + 64 + 83 + 66 + 30 + 81 + 68 + 47 + 52 = 585
- Agent 1: 49 + 44 + 47 + 52 + 30 + 50 + 71 + 66 + 47 = 456
- Agent 2: 5 + 13 + 3 + 47 + 43 + 34 + 8 + 29 + 27 = 209
- Agent 3: 63 + 48 + 13 + 34 + 94 + 20 + 42 + 43 + 60 = 417

The sum of all item values combined for all agents is 1667.

Now, let's allocate items to maximize fairness, ensuring every agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations and ensuring every item is allocated. 

1. Start by allocating the highest-value items each agent values most.
2. Ensure some balance by distributing items so that the total perceived value for each agent is somewhat equitable.

Here's a reasonable allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5] (Values: 94, 81)
- Agent 1: Items [3, 6, 7] (Values: 52, 71, 66)
- Agent 2: Items [4, 8] (Values: 43, 27)
- Agent 3: Items [1, 2] (Values: 48, 13)

This allocation ensures that each agent has a fair distribution based on their highest valued items. Each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
