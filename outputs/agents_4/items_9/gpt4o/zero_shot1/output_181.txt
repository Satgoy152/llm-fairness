Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  87  85  32  57  86  64   1  76
1  62  99  78  12  41  94   2   0   7
2  74  68  40  91  39  85  53  30  76
3  21  63  36  19  98  69  29  86  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and exactly 9 items in total are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for items 1 (87), 2 (85), and 5 (86). 
- **Agent 1**: The highest valuations are for items 1 (99), 5 (94), and 2 (78).
- **Agent 2**: The highest valuations are for items 3 (91), 0 (74), and 5 (85).
- **Agent 3**: The highest valuations are for items 4 (98), 7 (86), and 1 (63).

Considering these preferences, here is one potential way to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 1 (87) and 2 (85) to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 5 (94) and 0 (62) to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 3 (91) and 6 (53) to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 4 (98), 7 (86), and 8 (61) to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, with Agent 3 receiving an additional item because they have the highest valuation for item 4.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [4, 7, 8]
}
```
