Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  82  90  45  21  62  75  99  39
1  91  48  66  37  93  13  73  59  67
2  29  66  16  30  20  78  39  42   4
3  63  57  85  12  58  55  54  77  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives some items while maximizing the total value for each agent. We'll approach this by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least some items. 

Let's start by examining the highest valuations for each item and assign that item to the corresponding agent:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 91.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 82.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 90.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 45.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 93.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the highest at 78.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the highest at 75.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the highest at 99.
9. Item 8: Agent 3 values it the highest at 87.

Now, let's rearrange to ensure a fair distribution, giving priority to agents who have fewer items and ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

1. Assign Item 8 to Agent 3 (highest valuation).
2. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
3. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
4. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
5. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
6. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation not assigned).
8. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
9. Assign Item 7 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation not assigned).

This ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is reasonably fair:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7, 8]
}
```
