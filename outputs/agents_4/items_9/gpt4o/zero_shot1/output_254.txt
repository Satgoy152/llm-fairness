Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  66  73  97  40   6  56  59  93
1  78  45   3  13  73  80   8  64  87
2  21  37  38  77  28  58  68  53  59
3  29  95  44  27  89  80  26   6  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44 66 73 97 40  6 56 59 93]
 [78 45  3 13 73 80  8 64 87]

 [29 95 44 27 89 80 26  6 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to ensure that each agent gets a roughly equitable share of total value, while assigning all 9 items. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [44, 66, 73, 97, 40, 6, 56, 59, 93]
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (97), Item 8 (93)
   - Allocate items 3 and 8 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [78, 45, 3, 13, 73, 80, 8, 64, 87]
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (78), Item 5 (80)
   - Allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [21, 37, 38, 77, 28, 58, 68, 53, 59]
   - Highest valuation: Item 6 (68), Item 3 (77)
   - Allocate items 6 and 7 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [29, 95, 44, 27, 89, 80, 26, 6, 94]
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (95), Item 4 (89)
   - Allocate items 1 and 4 to Agent 3

5. **Check**: Ensure the total number of items allocated is 9. Each agent should have a fair share of valuable items based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1, 4, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations, ensuring that every agent gets a fair share of the items.
