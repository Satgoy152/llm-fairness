Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  76  79  66  51  76  62  83  69
1  74  77  83  33  19  60  13  93  79
2  60  64  65   6  10  84  42  52  45
3   5  60  40  20  52   4  98  51  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring fairness. We'll distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation from the items they receive, while also ensuring the distributions are as balanced as possible.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's assign items that have relatively high values by Agent 0.
   - Items: 0, 1, 8

2. **Agent 1**: Assign items with high valuations by Agent 1.
   - Items: 2, 7

3. **Agent 2**: Assign items with high valuations by Agent 2.
   - Items: 5

4. **Agent 3**: Assign items with high valuations by Agent 3.
   - Items: 4, 6, 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while keeping the distribution fairly balanced among the agents.
