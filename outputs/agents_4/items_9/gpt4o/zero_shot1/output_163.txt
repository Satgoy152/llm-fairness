Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  30  34  48   7  49  72  79  29
1  86   9  69  49  85  29  11  61   5
2  35  76   9  41  83  91   2  30  89
3  25  14  16  93  69  48  49  90  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. One way to achieve fairness is to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items, ensuring that each agent has a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's assign the items step by step, considering the highest valuations first:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 6 has the highest value (72).
   - Item 7 is the next highest (79).
   - Allocate items 6 and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0 has the highest value (86).
   - Item 4 is the next highest (85).
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 5 has the highest value (91).
   - Item 8 is the next highest (89).
   - Allocate items 5 and 8 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 3 has the highest value (93).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have one item left to allocate (item 1) and every agent has at least one item. Let's allocate item 1 to the agent with the highest valuation for it and with the fewest items:

- **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 (76), and currently has 2 items (same as all others except Agent 3).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 8],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is based on their valuations.
