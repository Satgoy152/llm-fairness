Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  27  96  37  14  55  24  12   1
1  89  91  97  36  81  27  26  57  84
2  64  27  62  35  56  53  81   1  88
3  99   5  25  34  13  95  71  96  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 4 agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. Here's one way to do that:

1. Start by considering the highest valuation each agent has for any item.
2. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most, if possible.
3. Ensure each agent ends up with at least one item, if possible.
4. Balance the allocation to ensure fairness in total valuation received.

Following this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Assign item 2, as it has a high value (96).
  - Assign item 0, as it has a reasonable value (52).

- Agent 1:
  - Assign item 1, as it has a high value (91).
  - Assign item 8, as it has a good value (84).

- Agent 2:
  - Assign item 6, as it has a high value (81).
  - Assign item 5, as it has a reasonable value (53).

- Agent 3:
  - Assign item 3, as it has a reasonable value (34).
  - Assign item 4, as it has a reasonable value (13).
  - Assign item 7, as it has a reasonable value (96).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and the total number of items assigned is 9.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 4, 7]
}
```
