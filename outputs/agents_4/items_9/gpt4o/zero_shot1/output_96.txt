Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  68  72  51  75  43   9  36  98
1  16  24  55  46  71  38  15  63  95
2  25  36   2  65  28  82  16  76  49
3  88  80   3  18  53  12   4  26  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy to maximize total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to go through each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most.

Let's examine each item:

- Item 0: Valuations are [71, 16, 25, 88]. Agent 3 values it the most.
- Item 1: Valuations are [68, 24, 36, 80]. Agent 3 values it the most.
- Item 2: Valuations are [72, 55, 2, 3]. Agent 0 values it the most.
- Item 3: Valuations are [51, 46, 65, 18]. Agent 2 values it the most.
- Item 4: Valuations are [75, 71, 28, 53]. Agent 0 values it the most.
- Item 5: Valuations are [43, 38, 82, 12]. Agent 2 values it the most.
- Item 6: Valuations are [9, 15, 16, 4]. Agent 2 values it the most.
- Item 7: Valuations are [36, 63, 76, 26]. Agent 2 values it the most.
- Item 8: Valuations are [98, 95, 49, 99]. Agent 3 values it the most.

Now, let's assign the items based on these evaluations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items []
- Agent 2: Items [3, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 1, 8]

Finally, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 5, 6, 7],
    "3": [0, 1, 8]
}
```
