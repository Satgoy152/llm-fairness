Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  19  46  30  40  54  90  57  18
1  60  54  39  48  62  20  94  47  50
2  46  65  85  19  52  64  28  54  41
3  15  64  79  52  17  69  21  42  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in such a way that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the other three agents will receive 2 or 3 items each.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for each agent and try to allocate the items to maximize their satisfaction.

First, calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 86 + 19 + 46 + 30 + 40 + 54 + 90 + 57 + 18 = 440
- Agent 1: 60 + 54 + 39 + 48 + 62 + 20 + 94 + 47 + 50 = 474
- Agent 2: 46 + 65 + 85 + 19 + 52 + 64 + 28 + 54 + 41 = 454
- Agent 3: 15 + 64 + 79 + 52 + 17 + 69 + 21 + 42 + 82 = 441

One strategy is to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent. Since we need to divide 9 items, we can consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Distribute items to the agents based on their highest valuations for specific items.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent gets roughly an equal number of items.

Allocations:

1. Agent 0 tends to have high valuations on items 0 and 6. Thus, assign items 0 and 6 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations on items 4 and 6, but item 6 is already taken. Assign items 4 and 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation on item 2, but item 2 is already taken. Assign items 5 and 8 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations on items 1, 3, and 8, but item 8 is already taken. Assign items 1, 3, and 7 to Agent 3.

After determining the allocations based on these considerations, here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [1, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuation and the total number of items allocated is 9.
