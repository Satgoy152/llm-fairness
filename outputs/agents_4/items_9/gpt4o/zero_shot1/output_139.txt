Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  63  68  43  11  72  69  14   3
1  48  72  14  77   4  37  34  10  51
2  76  16  17  34  76  27  80  24  28
3  26   5  93  77  24  71  24  57   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. We must also ensure that all 9 items are allocated.

One common method to achieve this is by using a "round-robin" approach, where we iterate over the agents and assign each agent the available item they value the most until all items are allocated. This doesn't guarantee perfect fairness in terms of total value but does distribute items in a balanced way.

Here's an allocation based on the given table:

1. Agent 0:  
   - Item 5 (Value: 72)
   - Item 6 (Value: 69)

2. Agent 1:  
   - Item 3 (Value: 77)
   - Item 1 (Value: 72)

3. Agent 2:  
   - Item 4 (Value: 76)
   - Item 0 (Value: 76)

4. Agent 3:  
   - Item 2 (Value: 93)
   - Item 7 (Value: 57)
   - Item 8 (Value: 1)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least two items, and all items are allocated. The distribution is based on each agent receiving items they highly value, as much as possible within the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [2, 7, 8]
}
```
