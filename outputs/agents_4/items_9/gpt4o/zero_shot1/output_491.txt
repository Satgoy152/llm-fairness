Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  38  99  77  60  17  95  75  44
1   6  72  88  41  52  91  94  22  17
2  76  66  54  50  91  66  98  95  47
3  24  11  24  59  31  90  53  21  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, totaling 9 items allocated. One common method to achieve this is to use a greedy approach, where we try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring everyone gets a fair share.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [95, 38, 99, 77, 60, 17, 95, 75, 44]
Agent 1: [6, 72, 88, 41, 52, 91, 94, 22, 17]
Agent 2: [76, 66, 54, 50, 91, 66, 98, 95, 47]
Agent 3: [24, 11, 24, 59, 31, 90, 53, 21, 30]
```

Now, let's allocate items based on maximizing individual agent values while ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 0, 2, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has high values for items 2, 5, and 6.
3. **Agent 2** has high values for items 4, 6, and 7.
4. **Agent 3** has high values for items 5 and 3.

We'll prioritize maximum values and ensure that no agent is left out:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (highest value).

Now, let's distribute the remaining items while maximizing individual agent values:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (maximize Agent 0's value).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest value).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (second highest value).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (maximize Agent 2's value).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3 (remaining item).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [4, 6, 7],
    "3": [3, 8]
}
```

In this allocation, every agent receives at least two items, and we have distributed all 9 items across the four agents.
