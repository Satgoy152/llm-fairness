Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55   7  81  81  99  25  14  70  27
1  12  59  93  38  31  23  92  88  85
2  21  61  41  96  87  51  72  54  20
3  71  46  34  27  82  49  92   4  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a form of a greedy algorithm to ensure each agent gets the items they value the most, while also ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent places on any single item, and allocate that item to the respective agent if it hasn't been allocated yet.

2. Continue this process by identifying the next highest value for each agent for the remaining items and allocate those.

3. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and no agent receives more than a fair share (given there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally get about 2.25 items, meaning some agents will get 2 and others 3).

Let's work through this:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value is 99 for item 4.
- Agent 1: Highest value is 93 for item 2.
- Agent 2: Highest value is 96 for item 3.
- Agent 3: Highest value is 92 for item 6.

At this point, items [4, 2, 3, 6] are allocated.

Now, let's identify the next highest values for remaining items and allocate them:

- Agent 0: Next highest value is 81 for item 0.
- Agent 1: Next highest value is 88 for item 7.
- Agent 2: Next highest value is 87 for item 4 (already allocated).
- Agent 3: Next highest value is 82 for item 4 (already allocated).

Continue:

- Agent 0: Next highest available value is 81 for item 3 (already allocated), then 81 for item 0 (allocated).
- Agent 1: Next highest available value is 85 for item 8.
- Agent 2: Next highest available value is 72 for item 6 (already allocated).
- Agent 3: Next highest available value is 71 for item 0 (allocated).

Final allocations with remaining items:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [3]
- Agent 3: Items [6, 8]

Now we have allocated 8 items, and one item (item 1) is left. Allocate it to the agent with the least items:

- Agent 2 gets item 1.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least two items, and all items are fairly distributed based on the given valuations.
