Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  12  88  78  56  80  41  77  86
1  15  51  54  14  50  13   9  65  18
2  11   9  68  25  92  72  45  60  24
3  26  22  52  98  91  94  12  32  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the preferences of each agent based on their valuations. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, while trying to maximize each agent's total valuation.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (88), 5 (80), and 8 (86).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (51), 2 (54), and 7 (65).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (92), 5 (72), and 2 (68).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (98), 5 (94), and 4 (91).

We need to allocate all 9 items in a way that is fair and respects the agents' preferences as much as possible.

Let's attempt the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 5, 8
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 4, 6
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 3

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated. Let's see this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
