Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  87  28  13  64  37  62   7  62
1  41  23  93  87  52  65  68  56  80
2  38  61  29  62   6  78  15   4   6
3  55  96  37  39  10  74  49  83  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will aim for a balanced distribution based on the given valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items with relatively high valuations are 1 and 6.
2. Agent 1: Items with relatively high valuations are 2 and 3.
3. Agent 2: Items with relatively high valuations are 5 and 7.
4. Agent 3: Items with relatively high valuations are 0, 4, and 8.

This results in each agent receiving either 2 or 3 items, while ensuring that all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on the valuations provided, and ensures that all items are allocated.
