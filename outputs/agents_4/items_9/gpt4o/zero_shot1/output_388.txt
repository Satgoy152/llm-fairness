Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  72  38  71  24  41  76  63   8
1  24  50  43  36  72  74  33  35  62
2  83   8  90  37  74  48  68  23   1
3  31  39  41  57  57  64  23  76  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider not only the valuations but also strive for a balance in the overall value each agent receives. Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 highly. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 highly. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 highly. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 highly. Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

After these allocations, each agent has one item. Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0** can also take item 3, which they value highly.
6. **Agent 1** can take item 5.
7. **Agent 2** can take item 0.
8. **Agent 3** can take item 8.
9. **Finally**, let's give item 1 to Agent 1 to balance out the distribution.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 1],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.
