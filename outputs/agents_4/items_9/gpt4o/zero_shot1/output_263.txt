Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  91  57  34   9  94  47  83  21
1  95  37  95  23  95  47   6  99  61
2   5  20  22  51  17  84  39  29  57
3  47  67  77  86  70  50   0  60  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed. A common approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction or total valuation of the items allocated.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: High values for items: 1 (91) and 5 (94).
2. **Agent 1**: High values for items: 0 (95), 2 (95), 4 (95), and 7 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: High value for item: 5 (84).
4. **Agent 3**: High values for items: 3 (86), 4 (70), and 2 (77).

To maximize fairness and valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 5.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 0, 2, and 7.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 6 and 8.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 3 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share, and the items are distributed according to their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated, with each agent receiving a subset of items according to their valuations, aiming at maximum fairness and total valuation.
