Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  82  32  90  38  25  64  14   3
1  35  20  11  78  66  24  35   9  63
2  86   7  52  73  64  69  82   0  98
3  31  16  31  14  61  38  40  47   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and exactly 9 items are allocated in total. Here is one possible way to do this:

- **Agent 0**: This agent values items 0, 1, and 3 highly. Allocating these items will maximize their overall valuation.

- **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 and item 8 relatively highly. Allocating these items will maximize their overall valuation.

- **Agent 2**: This agent values items 6 and 8 highly. However, since item 8 is already allocated to Agent 1, let's consider item 2 because it still provides a decent valuation.

- **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5 higher than the other items. Allocating this item will maximize their overall valuation.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation assigns exactly 9 items across the agents, with each agent receiving items that they value relatively highly.
