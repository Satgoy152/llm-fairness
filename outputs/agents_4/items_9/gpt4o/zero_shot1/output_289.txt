Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  69  23   0  87  12  53  14  75
1  40  65  13  23  28  48   4  61  93
2   8  76  65  56  57  66  48  89  30
3  17  40  33   4  22  56  99  63  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (since there are 4 agents and 9 items, at least one agent will receive more than one item). A common approach is to use a method that considers both the agent's valuation and the distribution of items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0: 60
   - Item 4: 87

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 8: 93
   - Item 1: 65

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 7: 89
   - Item 5: 66

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 6: 99
   - Item 3: 4
   - Item 2: 33

This allocation considers both maximizing the total valuation for each agent and ensuring each agent receives a fair share. Now, let's present it in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [8, 1],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [6, 3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 4 agents in a manner that fairly reflects their valuations.
