Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  35  50  30  67  67   1  43  95
1  19  16   0  63   1  10  92   9  67
2  35  77  43   4  96   8  37  55  16
3  51  52  41  97  18  41  54  69  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their valuations. We'll ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations and make initial allocations:

1. Start with items that have a significantly higher valuation for a particular agent compared to others.
2. Distribute remaining items by considering the next best valuations.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 8 (Value: 95) is highly valued by Agent 0 compared to others.
  - Item 0 (Value: 83) is the highest for Agent 0.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 6 (Value: 92) is highly valued by Agent 1 compared to others.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 4 (Value: 96) is the highest for Agent 2.
  - Item 1 (Value: 77) is highly valued by Agent 2.

- **Agent 3:**
  - Item 3 (Value: 97) is the highest for Agent 3.

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Item 5 (Value: 67) is equally valued by Agent 0 as Item 4 is for Agent 2, but Agent 2 already has two high-value items.

- **Agent 3:**
  - Item 7 (Value: 69) is highly valued by Agent 3, and they have space for more items.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 2 (Value: 0) has the lowest value for Agent 1 but ensures an integer allocation.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8, 5],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed while considering the valuations.
