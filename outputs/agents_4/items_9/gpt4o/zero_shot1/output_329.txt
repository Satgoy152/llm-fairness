Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  95  25  39  32  62  43  16  19
1  94  20  21  79  79  36  50  58  55
2  97  32  95  70  95  24   4  97  16
3  12  38  39  14  76  13   7  40  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. One way to approach this is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets approximately the same number of items.
2. Adjust the allocation to make sure each agent receives at least two items, if possible, and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items with this strategy:

- Agent 0: Highest valuations are for items 1 (95) and 0 (90).
- Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 0 (94) and 3 (79).
- Agent 2: Highest valuations are for items 0 (97), 2 (95), and 4 (95).
- Agent 3: Highest valuations are for items 8 (80) and 4 (76).

Considering these valuations, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [3, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 4, 7]
- Agent 3: [6, 8]

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and that all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 7],
    "3": [6, 8]
}
```
