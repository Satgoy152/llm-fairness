Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  74   7  63  73  74  89  73   9
1  92  32  68  98  37  56  56  30  71
2  73  90   0  20  14  79  61  52  89
3   8  84  31  42  70  77  55  88  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 4 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. We aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:** For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. **Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuation:** Give each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items to the extent possible.
3. **Check the distribution:** Make sure all items are allocated, and adjust if any agent is overloaded or underloaded.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (92).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (90).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (68).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (98).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (73).
- Item 5: Agent 0 and Agent 3 both value it at 74. We can assign it to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (89).
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most (88).
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most (89).

Now, let's ensure each agent receives a reasonable share by adjusting allocations if necessary:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 5, 6] 
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 8]
- Agent 3: Item [7]

This allocation gives each agent at least two items, except Agent 3, who receives one item due to the limited number of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [7]
}
```
