Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  47  50  53  13  97  40  36  58
1  94  17  99   2  71  79   8  12  21
2   9  81  66  79  92  18   7  95  22
3  20  96  16  74  11  91  72  18  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while distributing the items as evenly as possible. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations.

We'll proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
    - Highest valuations: Item 5 (97), Item 3 (53), Item 2 (50)

2. **Agent 1:**
    - Highest valuations: Item 2 (99), Item 0 (94), Item 5 (79)

3. **Agent 2:**
    - Highest valuations: Item 7 (95), Item 4 (92), Item 3 (79)

4. **Agent 3:**
    - Highest valuations: Item 1 (96), Item 5 (91), Item 8 (78)

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item and distribute them fairly:

- **Agent 0**: We can assign Item 5 (97) and Item 3 (53).
- **Agent 1**: We can assign Item 2 (99) and Item 0 (94).
- **Agent 2**: We can assign Item 7 (95) and Item 4 (92).
- **Agent 3**: We can assign Item 1 (96), Item 8 (78), and Item 6 (72).

This distribution ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [1, 8, 6]
}
```
