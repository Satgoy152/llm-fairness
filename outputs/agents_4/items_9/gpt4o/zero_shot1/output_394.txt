Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  74   3  99  39   7  18  47  21
1  40  93  59  63  52   9  72  23   3
2  38  89  28  88  22  19  45  21   8
3  30  39  99  91  69  65  10  56  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a high value for item 3 (99), so we start by assigning this item to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highly (93), so assign this item to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 (88) fairly high, but since it's already taken, we assign item 0 to Agent 2, which has a moderate value (38).
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 2 (99), so we assign this item to Agent 3.

Now, let's proceed by ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation remains fair:

5. **Agent 0**: Assign item 7 (47), as it's the next highest value for Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1**: Assign item 6 (72), as it has a high value for Agent 1.
7. **Agent 2**: Assign item 8 (8), even though the value is low, to give Agent 2 a second item.
8. **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 (69), which is highly valued by Agent 3.

Finally, assign the remaining item:

9. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (19), as it provides a moderate value for Agent 2 and balances their total value compared to others.

Here's the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 5, 8],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with each agent getting an integer number of items.
