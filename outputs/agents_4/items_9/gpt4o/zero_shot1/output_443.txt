Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  10  80  37  80  15  85  18   3
1  16  87  10  80  10  99  84  81  71
2  63  32   0   1  21   2  34  24  91
3  33  67   2  96  39  94  33  71  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and aim to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here, we will attempt to distribute the items in a way that balances the total valuations among the agents as evenly as possible and ensures that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 2, 4, and 6 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 1, 5, and 7 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 8 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 3 and 0 highly.

Based on these observations, a possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 4]
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 5]
- Agent 2 receives items [8]
- Agent 3 receives items [0, 3, 6, 7]

This allocation considers the highest-valued items for each agent and distributes the items while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [0, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
