Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  56  78   7  91  63  17  12  21
1  47  95  78  16  16  89  10  40  18
2  36  46  34  32  73  75  88   9  84
3  20   6  93  74  17  33  33  38  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Given the valuations, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent ends up with a comparable share of their preferred items. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 4 (91) highly. We can give them item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a high valuation for item 1 (95). We can give them item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a high valuation for item 6 (88). We can give them item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 (93) highly. We can give them item 2.

Now, we need to distribute the remaining items (0, 3, 5, 7, 8) among the agents to ensure each gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: After receiving item 4, the next best available item is 0 (48).
- **Agent 1**: After receiving item 1, items 5 (89) and 7 (40) are valuable. We assign them item 5.
- **Agent 2**: After receiving item 6, item 8 (84) is also highly valued.
- **Agent 3**: After receiving item 2, item 3 (74) is next in value.

This leaves us with item 7 unallocated, which agent 1 values reasonably (40). Let's assign it to them.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1, 5, 7],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on the highest valuations and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.
