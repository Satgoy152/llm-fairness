Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  30  12  62   7  21   6  42  36
1  37  20  22  62  45  80  60  32  63
2   4  68  29  19  89  90  95   4  40
3  95  25  67  33   5   9  89  83  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll focus on distributing the items such that the overall valuation is balanced across the agents. 

Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (62), Item 7 (42)
   - Allocate items: [3, 7]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (80), Item 8 (63)
   - Allocate items: [5, 8]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (95), Item 4 (89)
   - Allocate items: [6, 4]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (95), Item 2 (67), Item 1 (25)
   - Allocate items: [0, 2, 1]

This allocation gives each agent a fair distribution based on their highest valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated. 

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [0, 2, 1]
}
```
