Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  64  36  30  52   0   1  18  85
1  12  92  57  83  10  92   3  69  53
2  97  17  25  13  97  46   9   6  45
3  23  64  35  37   4  80  22  47  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 64 36 30 52  0  1 18 85]
 [12 92 57 83 10 92  3 69 53]

 [23 64 35 37  4 80 22 47 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to 4 agents, we must consider each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, aiming for an equitable distribution. Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as they value it highly (97).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as they value it highly (92).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2, as they value it highly (97).
4. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as they value it highly (80).
5. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as they have a moderately good valuation (36) and it helps balance their total value.
6. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as they value it significantly (83).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2, as it helps balance their total value (9).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 3, as they value it moderately (47).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 0, as they value it highly (85).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and distributes the items in a way that aims for a balanced total value for each agent.
