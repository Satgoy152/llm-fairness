Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  98  30  99  82   5  69  26  72
1  78  28  62  61  92  23  69   6  62
2  66  33  23   0   9  14  35  57  27
3  33  91  55  17  38  31  80   4  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives some items to maximize fairness. Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total number of items each agent should receive:
   - There are 9 items and 4 agents, so a fair distribution aims for each agent to get approximately 9/4 = 2.25 items. Since we can only allocate whole items, some agents will receive 2 items, and some will receive 3 items.

2. Allocate items based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring fairness:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 4 and 0.
   - Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for items 7 and 6.
   - Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1 and 6.

3. Assign items to agents to maximize their satisfaction:
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives items 4 and 0.
   - Agent 2 receives items 7 and 5.
   - Agent 3 receives items 6, 8, and 2.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [6, 8, 2]
}
```
