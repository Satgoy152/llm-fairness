Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87   4  36  51  63  58  76  30  43
1  26  82  45  74  50  56   3  51  37
2  44  99  44  13  57  19  49  59  13
3  25  61  45  84  46  39  11  67  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent's valuation is optimized based on their preferences. We will ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Given the table of valuations, we can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation might look:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 87 by Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 99 by Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 45 by Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 84 by Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 63 by Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 58 by Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 76 by Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 67 by Agent 3.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 71 by Agent 3.

Now, we notice that Agent 0 has been assigned too many items (4) while Agent 1 has only 1 item, and Agent 2 has 1 item. We need a fairer distribution of items.

Let's re-allocate to balance:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Give Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Give Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Give Item 3 to Agent 3.
- Give Item 4 to Agent 3 (since 46 by Agent 3 is the next highest).
- Give Item 5 to Agent 1 (since 56 by Agent 1 is the next highest).
- Give Item 6 to Agent 2 (next highest for that item).
- Give Item 7 to Agent 0 (since 67 by Agent 3 is already taken by another item).
- Give Item 8 to Agent 3.

This gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 6
- Agent 3: Items 3, 4, 8

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are distributed.
