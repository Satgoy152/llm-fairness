Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39   4  93  52  76  43  90  58  53
1  54  40  76  55  30  36  92  29  76
2  11  66   9  25  97  89  61  18  70
3  94  32  26   9  91  60  38   2  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple greedy algorithm. We'll allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and that all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 94.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 3.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 66.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 55.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 89.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 2.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 90.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 0.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 58.
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 0.

9. **Item 8**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 92.
   - Allocate item 8 to agent 3.

The allocations based on the above steps will be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4, 5],
    "3": [0, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
