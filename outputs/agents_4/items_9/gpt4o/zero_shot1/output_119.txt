Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  95  24  37  77  97  71  54  39
1  24   2  57   3  35  59  94  50  46
2  62  73  37  60  56  59  26  14  19
3  78  16  95  87  69  16  76  69  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given in the table. A fair allocation might strive to maximize each agent's total valuation or to ensure a balanced distribution of value among the agents. One approach is to assign items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents, trying to equalize the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning the item with the highest valuation to the respective agent.
2. Continue assigning the remaining items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. Ensure the total number of allocated items is exactly 9.

Following this strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most at 97.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most at 94.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 73.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most at 95.

After allocating these items, each agent has one item. Now, distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuations:

- Assign item 0 to agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Assign item 7 to agent 1.
- Assign item 8 to agent 2.

This allocation results in a balanced distribution of items, with each agent getting a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 3, 8],
    "3": [2, 0]
}
```
