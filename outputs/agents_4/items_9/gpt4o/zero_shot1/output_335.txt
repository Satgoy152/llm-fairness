Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  55  35  97  87  66  33  37  65
1  63  29  52   9  21   2  57  78  87
2  12  25  53  44  38  92  21   5   0
3  59   0  18  77   7  51  50  78  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given that there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive about 2 items, with one agent receiving 3 items to ensure all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Choose items with the highest values for Agent 0.
   - Items: 3 (97) and 4 (87).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Choose items with the highest values for Agent 1.
   - Items: 8 (87) and 7 (78).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Choose items with the highest values for Agent 2.
   - Items: 5 (92) and 2 (53).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Choose items with the highest values for Agent 3.
   - Items: 0 (59), 6 (50), and 1 (0).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [8, 7],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [0, 6, 1]
}
```
