Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  35  38  47  69  45  67  15  74
1  34  75  96  84  76  74  35  76   7
2  27  24  97  37  21  52  94  48  48
3  20  48  36  57   8  65  64  50  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [20 48 36 57  8 65 64 50 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total valuation, while also ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**  
   - Highest valued items: 8 (74), 4 (69), 6 (67), 3 (47), 5 (45)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**  
   - Highest valued items: 2 (96), 1 (75), 3 (84), 4 (76), 5 (74)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**  
   - Highest valued items: 2 (97), 6 (94), 5 (52), 7 (48), 8 (48)

4. **Agent 3's Valuations:**  
   - Highest valued items: 5 (65), 3 (57), 1 (48), 6 (64), 7 (50)

Let's start allocating items to the agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each item is only allocated once:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because it has the highest valuation (96) for them.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 because it has the second highest valuation (94) for them.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 because it has the highest valuation (65) for them.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 because it has a high valuation (76) for them and no higher competing valuations.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 0 because it has a high valuation (74) for them and no higher competing valuations.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 because it has a high valuation (84) for them and no higher competing valuations.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because it has a high valuation (75) for them and no higher competing valuations.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 because it has a high valuation (48) for them and no higher competing valuations.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because it has the only valuation left for them.

Here is the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0],
    "1": [2, 4, 3, 1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and each item is allocated exactly once.
