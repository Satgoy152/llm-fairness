Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  95  61  92  53  46  40   9  97
1  75  98  35  27  95  14  66  77  71
2  70  62  14   5  54  30  53  73  68
3  40  21  72  82  81  59  32  30  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while respecting the constraint that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. There are several approaches to achieve this, such as maximizing the sum of valuations across all agents or ensuring each agent gets items they value highly. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Considered items: 0, 1, 3, 8 (high valuations)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Considered items: 4, 7 (high valuations)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Considered items: 6 (high valuation)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Considered items: 2, 5 (remaining high valuations)

Let's distribute the items:

- **Agent 0** gets items: 0, 1
- **Agent 1** gets items: 4, 7
- **Agent 2** gets item: 6
- **Agent 3** gets items: 2, 3, 5, 8

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed and each agent receives a number of items.
