Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  29  30  36  29  39  39  78  25
1  83  69  29  35  95  74   6  19  59
2  27   6  54  85  81   1  55  92  44
3  25  71  56  16  86  27  30  18  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify highest valued items for each agent**: Assign each agent the item(s) they value the most, ensuring no conflicts arise where two agents want the same item.

2. **Allocate remaining items**: After initial allocations, distribute the remaining items to the agents with the next highest valuations, considering fairness in terms of the total value each agent receives.

This approach will ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 7 and 0.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 4 and 0 (but item 0 is already taken).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 7 and 3 (item 7 is already taken).
- Agent 3 has high valuations for item 4 (already taken).

Given these observations and to ensure fairness, we can attempt the following allocation:

- Assign items based on descending order of valuation and ensuring no conflicts.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 2, 6],
    "3": [1, 5, 8]
}
```

This way, each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
