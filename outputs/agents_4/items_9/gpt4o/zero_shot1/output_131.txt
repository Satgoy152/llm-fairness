Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  92  57   7  30  77  18  87  49
1  51   2  51  12  59  51  25  40  55
2  96  58  72  75  63  70  25   7  91
3   6  59  60  45  22   7  66  83  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the preferences of each agent and attempts to maximize overall satisfaction. One way to do this is by using a greedy algorithm where items are allocated based on the highest value an agent assigns to them. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values item 1 (92) and item 7 (87).
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 4 (59).
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 0 (96), item 2 (72), and item 8 (91).
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 6 (66) and item 3 (45).

By analyzing these preferences, here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [1, 7]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 8]
- Agent 3: [3, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2, 8],
    "3": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
