Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  27  11  10  23  12  87  49  95
1  86  19  46  87  29   9   1  13  77
2  40  52  63  85  78  34  10  52  45
3  64  81  58  53  79  78  70  44  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives. This is a common problem in fair division, and there are various approaches. Here, I'll use a simple method to distribute the items so that each agent gets a relatively balanced total valuation.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 25 + 27 + 11 + 10 + 23 + 12 + 87 + 49 + 95 = 339
- Agent 1: 86 + 19 + 46 + 87 + 29 + 9 + 1 + 13 + 77 = 367
- Agent 2: 40 + 52 + 63 + 85 + 78 + 34 + 10 + 52 + 45 = 459
- Agent 3: 64 + 81 + 58 + 53 + 79 + 78 + 70 + 44 + 95 = 622

To make the allocation fair, let's try to give each agent a balanced total value. Since there are 9 items, and 4 agents, each agent should roughly get 9/4 = 2.25 items. We will aim to balance the total valuation and distribute 2 or 3 items per agent.

Allocation strategy:
- Distribute items based on highest individual valuations to each agent while keeping an eye on balancing the total valuation among agents.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets items with high personal valuation: [6, 8]
2. Agent 1 gets items with high personal valuation: [0, 3]
3. Agent 2 gets items with high personal valuation: [2, 4, 7]
4. Agent 3 gets items with high personal valuation: [1, 5]

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4, 7],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items such that each agent receives a fair share relative to their valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated.
