Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81   5  78  29  94  78  71  39  78
1  37  97  40  18  80  25  46  41  50
2  90  65   6  12  26  91  68  55  75
3  42  85  76  18  73  54  96  59  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to use a greedy strategy where we allocate items one by one to the agents based on who values them the most. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Item 4 (value 94)
    - Item 0 (value 81)
    - Item 2 (value 78)

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Item 1 (value 97)
    - Item 8 (value 50)

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Item 5 (value 91)
    - Item 6 (value 68)

4. **Agent 3**:
    - Item 7 (value 59)
    - Item 3 (value 18)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 2],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [7, 3]
}
```
