Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  11  32  47  75  11  55  35  30
1  17  93  55  39  81  86  32  36  46
2  49  66  92  60  18  32  36  70  20
3  69  66  33  48  21  56  44  76  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives as much as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent can potentially receive if they get all items:
   - Agent 0: 16 + 11 + 32 + 47 + 75 + 11 + 55 + 35 + 30 = 312
   - Agent 1: 17 + 93 + 55 + 39 + 81 + 86 + 32 + 36 + 46 = 485
   - Agent 2: 49 + 66 + 92 + 60 + 18 + 32 + 36 + 70 + 20 = 443
   - Agent 3: 69 + 66 + 33 + 48 + 21 + 56 + 44 + 76 + 47 = 460

2. Allocate items to balance the total values as best as possible:
   - Choose high-value items for agents with higher total potential value and lower-value items for agents with lower potential value.

By using this logic, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 8] 
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 3, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [6]

This allocation tries to balance the value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3, 7],
    "3": [6]
}
```
