Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  50  52  20  58  27  49  81  13
1  58  37  38   2  60  62  71  42  53
2  95  14  11  76  60   0  56  16  48
3  96  81   0  20  75  71   6  52  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and try to distribute them so that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and try to balance the high-value items among agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 3 (high valuation of 96).
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (high valuation of 50).
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (high valuation of 52).
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (high valuation of 76).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (high valuation of 60).
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 (high valuation of 62).
- Assign item 6 to agent 1 (high valuation of 71).
- Assign item 7 to agent 0 (high valuation of 81).
- Assign item 8 to agent 3 (high valuation of 63).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize the total value for each agent. 

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed fairly and efficiently among the agents based on their valuations.
