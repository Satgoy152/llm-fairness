Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  45  40  69  29  97   0  89  58
1  35  59  22  27   8  33  66  76  72
2  20  77  85  26  44  23  98  46  13
3  59  95  34  15  64  23  81  86   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on giving them items they value highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Ensure they get items they also value, without duplicating too much with Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items with high preference.
4. **Agent 3**: Distribute remaining items while considering their valuation.

After reviewing the valuation table, here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 5, 7 (Highest for Agent 0: items 5, 7)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 8 (Highest for Agent 1: items 1, 8)
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 6 (Highest for Agent 2: items 2, 6)
- **Agent 3**: Items 0, 3, 4 (Remaining items with reasonable valuations for Agent 3)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
