Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  30  21  16  20  52  11  91  10
1  20  95  24  79  65  89  99  71   3
2  91  35  19  57  53  29  21  61  13
3  28  59  14  64  87  17  86  66  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. 

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Key Valuations**: Look for high-value items for each agent that would maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Allocate Based on Maximum Valuations**: Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations first, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated**: Adjust allocations to ensure all items are assigned to an agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 7.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 6.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 4 and 8.

Allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [7]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 3: Items [4, 8, 5, 2]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4, 8, 5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
