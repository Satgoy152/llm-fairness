Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  84  74  50  43  86  24  51  52
1  69  32  43  83  16   8  22  10  71
2  67  35  54  42  64  42  87  57  98
3  30  78  21   8  82  56  13  97  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive around 2 items, with one agent receiving an additional item to account for all 9 items.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 5 (86), 1 (84)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 3 (83), 8 (71)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 8 (98), 6 (87)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value items: 7 (97), 4 (82)

Now, let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 5 and 1
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 3 and 8
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 6 and 2 (54, second highest after 8)
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 7 and 4

Having allocated 8 items, one item remains unallocated (item 0). We need to assign it to an agent who can benefit the most without causing an unfair distribution:

- Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 1 (69), so assigning it to Agent 1 balances the allocation, giving them one extra item.

Based on this analysis, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3, 8, 0],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [7, 4]
}
```
