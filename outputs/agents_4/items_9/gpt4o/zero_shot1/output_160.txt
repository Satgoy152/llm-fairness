Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  62  98  61  79  83  95  14   9
1  70  63  78  77  18  41  56  35  39
2  72  28  51   4  34  65  20  88  68
3  26  94  50  24  58   6  82   3  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them items they value highly, while ensuring that the total number of items given out is exactly 9.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value item for each agent and allocate that item to the respective agent, if it hasn't already been allocated.
2. Iterate through the remaining items and allocate them to the agents who value them the most, ensuring no agent gets more than their fair share unless necessary for fairness.
3. Ensure all items are allocated.

Following these steps, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items they value the most: 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 gets items they value the most: 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets items they value the most: 7 and 8.
- Agent 3 gets items they value the most: 1 and 6.
- Item 4 is given to Agent 2 as it fills their allocation without exceeding their fair share.

Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 7, 8],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
