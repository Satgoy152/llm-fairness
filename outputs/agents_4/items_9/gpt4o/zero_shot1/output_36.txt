Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  76  43  27  19  64  54  88  43
1  95   5   2  64   2  65  90  23  12
2  32  87  10  69  99  54  70  32   3
3  51  35  72  89  10  65  82  13  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a balanced distribution:

1. **List the Items by Agent Valuation**: Assess which agent values each item the most, as this might guide the allocation to maximize total satisfaction.

2. **Initial Allocation to Maximize Value**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most.
   - Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most.
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most.
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it the most.

3. **Check Balance and Adjust**: Ensure each agent has a fair number of items and adjust if needed to balance the allocation.

4. **Balanced Allocation**:
   - Ensure that no agent has too many or too few items compared to others.

Here's a balanced allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least 2 items, and the distribution is relatively fair based on their valuations.
