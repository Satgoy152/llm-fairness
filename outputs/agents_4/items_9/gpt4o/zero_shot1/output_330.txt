Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  22  39   0  38  90  47  42  57
1  18  25  65  65  72  54  53   6  98
2  71  22  46  50  80   4  97  52  31
3  84  50  95  63  70   3  85  58  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one approach is to try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the item each agent values the most and try to allocate it accordingly.
2. Ensure that all agents get at least one item.
3. Check if reallocating items can increase the overall satisfaction without leaving any agent with zero items.

Based on the table provided, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (value = 90).
- Agent 1 values item 8 the most (value = 98).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (value = 97).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (value = 95).

Allocate these items to the respective agents first, then allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 0] (Total valuation = 90 + 78 = 168)
- Agent 1: Items [8, 4] (Total valuation = 98 + 72 = 170)
- Agent 2: Items [6, 3] (Total valuation = 97 + 50 = 147)
- Agent 3: Items [2, 1, 7] (Total valuation = 95 + 50 + 58 = 203)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [8, 4],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [2, 1, 7]
}
```
