Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  25  12  29  41   9  49  11  95
1  69  99   9  39  70  20  64  65  81
2  47  16  53  44   5  17  28  22  20
3  90  13  32  68  21  40  74  16   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we need to aim for a distribution where each agent receives a similar total valuation, and each agent can potentially receive at least two items, given there are more items than agents. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to distribute items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 18 + 25 + 12 + 29 + 41 + 9 + 49 + 11 + 95 = 289
- Agent 1: 69 + 99 + 9 + 39 + 70 + 20 + 64 + 65 + 81 = 516
- Agent 2: 47 + 16 + 53 + 44 + 5 + 17 + 28 + 22 + 20 = 252
- Agent 3: 90 + 13 + 32 + 68 + 21 + 40 + 74 + 16 + 9 = 363

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values item 8, which is the highest valuation by any agent. Allocate item 8 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1, which is the second-highest valuation. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2, which is their highest valuation. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 0, which is their highest valuation. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Let's continue the allocation considering remaining high valuations and aiming for balance:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 4 (41) to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Allocate item 4 (70) to Agent 1. But since item 4 is already considered for Agent 0, let's consider item 3 (39) for Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Allocate item 5 (17) to Agent 2.
- Agent 3: Allocate item 6 (74) to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 7 items, 2 more to allocate:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 7 (11) to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Allocate item 5 (20) to Agent 1.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the valuations each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.
