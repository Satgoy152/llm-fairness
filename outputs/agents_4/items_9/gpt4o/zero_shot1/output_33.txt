Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  76  78  41  46  84  55  67  27
1  47   8  95  91  31  12  80  78  90
2  84  66  38  80  50  20  24  65   7
3   9  47  92  76  39  39  70  12  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to consider each agent's preference for the items while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 4 agents, one approach is to try to distribute items as evenly as possible, with some agents receiving 2 items and others receiving 3 items, as it is impossible to evenly distribute 9 items among 4 agents with each receiving the same number.

First, let's outline a potential allocation strategy:

1. Identify items with the highest individual valuations for each agent.
2. Allocate these items to maximize each agent's total valuation.
3. Balance the number of items each agent receives.

Given these steps, we can proceed to allocate items:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest valuations are for items: 5 (84), 2 (78), 1 (76)
  - Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 0

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valuations are for items: 2 (95), 3 (91), 8 (90)
  - Allocate items 3 and 8 to Agent 1

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest valuations are for items: 0 (84), 3 (80), 1 (66)
  - Allocate items 0 and 7 to Agent 2

- **Agent 3:**
  - Highest valuations are for items: 8 (94), 2 (92), 3 (76)
  - Allocate items 4, 5, and 6 to Agent 3

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share, maximizing their individual item valuations, and all items are allocated.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This distribution provides a reasonable balance of total valuations and item count among the agents.
