Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  46  95  92   6  39  22  29  92
1  20  16  27  79  25  89  74  99  60
2  95  67  20  16  37   1  88  42  15
3  38  55  43  62  35   0  71  72   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we should consider how to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items such that the agents receive the items they value the most. However, since the problem emphasizes fairness, we must also ensure each agent receives a fair share of items, considering all agents should receive at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate the items step by step, ensuring each agent receives items they value highly while maintaining fairness.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (95). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Next highest is item 0 with a value of 80. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (99). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
   - Next highest is item 5 with a value of 89. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest, but item 0 is already taken by Agent 0. Next, item 6 is valued highly at 88. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
   - Next highest is item 1 with a value of 67. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 7 the highest, but it is already taken by Agent 1. Next, item 3 is valued at 62. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Next highest is item 1, but it is already taken by Agent 2. Item 4 has a value of 35. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now all items are allocated. Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 4, 8]
}
```
