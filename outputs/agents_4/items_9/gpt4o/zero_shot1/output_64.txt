Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  81  58  27  45  44  84  34   9
1  37  87  21  40  53  17   2  86  14
2  36  50  49  76  61  14  89  52  51
3  49  18   6  18  57  48  51   9  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least two items (since there are 9 items and 4 agents). Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values for agent 0 are items 1 (81) and 6 (84).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values for agent 1 are items 1 (87) and 7 (86), but since item 1 is already taken, agent 1 can take items 4 (53) and 7 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values for agent 2 are items 6 (89) and 3 (76), but since item 6 is taken, agent 2 can take items 2 (49) and 3 (76).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 0 (49). To ensure all agents receive at least two items, agent 3 can take items 0 (49) and 5 (48).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:
- Item 8 can be given to Agent 1 to balance out the allocations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 7, 8],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with all items distributed among the agents.
