Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  86  88  26  13  45  83  56  75
1  40  44  34  46  83  70  41  86  55
2  66  66  95  88  55  53  87   8  69
3  13  77   4   9  86  90   2  64  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the preferences of each agent based on their valuations. A common approach is to allocate the items to maximize the total valuation, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent.
2. Allocate items to maximize the total valuation for each agent.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item (if possible).

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 80 + 86 + 88 + 26 + 13 + 45 + 83 + 56 + 75 = 552
- Agent 1's total valuation: 40 + 44 + 34 + 46 + 83 + 70 + 41 + 86 + 55 = 499
- Agent 2's total valuation: 66 + 66 + 95 + 88 + 55 + 53 + 87 + 8 + 69 = 587
- Agent 3's total valuation: 13 + 77 + 4 + 9 + 86 + 90 + 2 + 64 + 15 = 360

Next, allocate items by choosing the highest valued items first, ensuring fairness and maximizing each agent's valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most, followed by items 0 and 6.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most, followed by items 7 and 5.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most, followed by items 3 and 6.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most, followed by items 4 and 1.

Balancing these allocations, we can distribute items as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 2] (valuations: 80, 88)
- Agent 1: [4, 7] (valuations: 83, 86)
- Agent 2: [3, 6] (valuations: 88, 87)
- Agent 3: [1, 5, 8] (valuations: 77, 90, 15)

In this allocation, each agent has at least two items, and we ensure all 9 items are distributed.

Now, let's provide the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 5, 8]
}
```
