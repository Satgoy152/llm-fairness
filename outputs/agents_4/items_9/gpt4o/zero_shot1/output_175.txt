Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  51   8  13  45  21   7  94  22
1  50  81  92  31  14  14  54  85  88
2  97  89  37  47  28  95  78  79  95
3   2  52  17  39  13  11   9  95  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's first consider the valuations and aim to assign items to the agents who value them most:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (92), Item 7 (94)
   - We assign Item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (92), Item 8 (88)
   - We assign Item 8 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (97), Item 5 (95), Item 8 (95)
   - Since Item 0 is also highly valued by Agent 0, and Agent 1 already has a high-value item in Item 8, we assign Item 0 to Agent 2 to maximize fairness.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (95)
   - Since Item 7 is already assigned, we look for the next highest value not already allocated, such as Item 3 (39).
   - We assign Item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items to ensure all agents receive items fairly:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign Item 1 (51) to Agent 0 for additional allocation.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign Item 4 (14) to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign Item 5 (95) to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3**:
   - Assign Item 6 (9) to Agent 3.

9. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign Item 2 (37) to Agent 2.

The allocations ensure that each agent receives a fair share considering their highest valuations, while also distributing all 9 items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [8, 4],
    "2": [0, 5, 2],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
