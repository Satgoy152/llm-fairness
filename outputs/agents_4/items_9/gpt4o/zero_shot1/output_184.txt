Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  94  80  34  98  65  83  14  61
1  33  62  11  57  95  13   8  84  25
2  11  47  62   9  33  56  36  68  57
3  30   6  14  62  42  60  16  42  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, a common approach is to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, while ensuring that all items are distributed. Given that we have 9 items and 4 agents, one possible approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are assigned.

Here's one way to assign the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's go through the distribution process:

Agent 0 has high values for items 1, 4, and 0.
Agent 1 has high values for items 4, 7, and 3.
Agent 2 has high values for items 2, 1, and 7.
Agent 3 has high values for items 8, 5, and 3.

Let's allocate the items:

- Give item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value).
- Give item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value after item 4).
- Give item 7 to Agent 1 (highest value after item 4 and 1).
- Give item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value after items 4, 1, and 7).
- Give item 8 to Agent 3 (highest value after items 4, 1, 7, and 0).
- Give item 5 to Agent 3 (next highest value).
- Give item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value after items 4, 1, 7, 0, 8, and 5).
- Give item 6 to Agent 0 (next highest value).
- Give item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest value).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their item valuations. Now, let's present this allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 2, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with all 9 items distributed.
