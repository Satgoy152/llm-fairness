Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95   4  30  26  49  10  39  50  24
1  56  60   4  29  97  71  41  74  28
2  44  71  81  53  88  39  14  46  29
3  83  33   5  42  27  71   5  30  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** should receive the items that maximize their total value. Based on the table, Agent 0 highly values item 0 (95), item 7 (50), and item 6 (39).

2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 4 (97), item 7 (74), and item 5 (71).

3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (81), item 1 (71), and item 4 (88).

4. **Agent 3** values item 0 (83), item 5 (71), and item 3 (42).

Let's allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [4, 7]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 2]
- **Agent 3**: [3, 5, 8]

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3, 5, 8]
}
```

This ensures a fair distribution according to the agents' valuations and that all 9 items are allocated.
