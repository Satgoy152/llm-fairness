Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  31  32  42  75  79  61  52  88
1   1  12  65  51  12  76   3  57   0
2  49  84  29  95   4  79  76  60  16
3  24  72   6  25  91  11  22   5  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim to balance the total value given to each agent. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here's one potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Start by identifying high-value items for each agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Balance the total value to ensure fairness.

Allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign items 4, 5 (75 + 79 = 154)
- Agent 1: Assign items 2, 7 (65 + 57 = 122)
- Agent 2: Assign items 3, 6, 8 (95 + 76 + 16 = 187)
- Agent 3: Assign items 0, 1 (24 + 72 = 96)

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3, 6, 8],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items so that each agent receives at least one item and the total value is distributed relatively fairly across all agents.
