Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  60  23  24  51  57  63  65   7
1   8  24  71  35  32   6  16  77  35
2  75  35  59  29  70  83  92  65  78
3  82  28  89  68  13  38  76  56  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [82 28 89 68 13 38 76 56 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the total value each agent receives as evenly as possible. We will consider the valuation each agent has for each item and try to balance the distribution so that each agent receives a reasonable share of their preferred items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent first:

- Agent 0: 63 + 60 + 23 + 24 + 51 + 57 + 63 + 65 + 7 = 413
- Agent 1: 8 + 24 + 71 + 35 + 32 + 6 + 16 + 77 + 35 = 304
- Agent 2: 75 + 35 + 59 + 29 + 70 + 83 + 92 + 65 + 78 = 586
- Agent 3: 82 + 28 + 89 + 68 + 13 + 38 + 76 + 56 + 33 = 483

Now, let's allocate items to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Agent 0 gets items [0, 1] because these are some of the items he values the highest (63, 60).
2. Agent 1 gets items [2, 7] because these are some of the items he values the highest (71, 77).
3. Agent 2 gets items [5, 6, 8] because these are some of the items he values the highest (83, 92, 78).
4. Agent 3 gets items [3, 4] because he values these items relatively higher than others (68, 13).

Finally, here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5, 6, 8],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
