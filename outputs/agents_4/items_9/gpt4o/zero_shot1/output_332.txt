Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  89  29  16  81  94  58  99  28
1  55  22  72  82  99   3  14  10  99
2  77  98  86  45  39  54  99  30   2
3  58  93  33  89  19  12  35  48  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations, we need to determine which items should be allocated to which agents so that the allocation is fair and balanced.

Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuations: Item 7 (99), Item 5 (94), Item 1 (89)
   - Let's allocate: Item 7, Item 5, and Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 4 (99), Item 8 (99), Item 3 (82)
   - Let's allocate: Item 4 and Item 8 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 6 (99), Item 1 (98), Item 2 (86)
   - Item 1 is already taken by Agent 0, so we consider Item 2 and Item 6.
   - Let's allocate: Item 2 and Item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: Item 3 (89), Item 1 (93), Item 0 (58)
   - Item 1 is already taken by Agent 0, and Item 3 has better value for Agent 3.
   - Let's allocate: Item 3 and Item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we ensure all items have been allocated:
- Allocated items: 7, 5, 1 (Agent 0); 4, 8 (Agent 1); 2, 6 (Agent 2); 3, 0 (Agent 3)
- Total items allocated: 9 (which matches the total number of items)

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5, 1],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all 9 items are allocated.
