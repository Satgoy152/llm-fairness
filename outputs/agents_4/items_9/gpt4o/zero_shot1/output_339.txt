Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  85  56  75  47  97  42  44  10
1  94  90  21  32  23  87  24  16  81
2  25  77  75  83  79  13  58  34   3
3   4  30  80  51  64  37  71  69   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets a balanced number of items. There are 9 items and 4 agents, so ideally, each agent should get around 2 to 3 items.

Let's examine the agents' valuations and attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (97), Item 1 (85), Item 3 (75)
   - Choose Items: 5 and 1

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (94), Item 1 (90), Item 5 (87)
   - Choose Items: 0 and 8 (81)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (83), Item 4 (79), Item 1 (77)
   - Choose Items: 3 and 4

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (80), Item 6 (71), Item 7 (69)
   - Choose Items: 2 and 6

Let's review to ensure no items are allocated more than once and all items are allocated:

- Items allocated: 5, 1, 0, 8, 3, 4, 2, 6
- Remaining item: 7

Agent 3 can also take item 7, as it is their third-highest value and will balance the allocation.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2, 6, 7]
}
```
