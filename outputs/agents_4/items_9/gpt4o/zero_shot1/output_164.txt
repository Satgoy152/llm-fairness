Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  98  38  70  89  82  31  19  82
1  36  42  29  81   2  76  71  56  48
2  79   9  87  30  43  70  74  27  78
3  27  75  61  28  64  21  16  80  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among 4 agents, we should strive to maximize the total valuation each agent has for their allocated items, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a potential approach to this problem:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate items to agents such that they receive the items they value most highly.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 0 and 2 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 7 and 8 highly.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable allocation might be:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, and 6
- Agent 3: Items 5, 7, and 8

This ensures that each agent gets some items, maximizing their valuation. Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2, 6],
    "3": [5, 7, 8]
}
```
