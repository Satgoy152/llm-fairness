Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  95  80  34   2  49  57  15   8
1  50  79  92  13   8  67  70   5  21
2  72  90  30  69  92  43  40  27   4
3   5  11   5  72   0  88  59  72  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Let's try to do this step by step:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**:
   - For Agent 0: Items 1 (95), 0 (83), and 2 (80) have high values.
   - For Agent 1: Items 2 (92), 1 (79), and 5 (67) have high values.
   - For Agent 2: Items 4 (92), 1 (90), and 3 (69) have high values.
   - For Agent 3: Items 5 (88), 3 (72), and 7 (72) have high values.

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Total Value**:
   - Let's attempt to allocate items such that each agent gets at least 2 items initially, and then distribute the remaining item based on remaining highest value.

3. **Make an Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Allocate items 0 (83), 1 (95)
   - Agent 1: Allocate items 2 (92), 5 (67)
   - Agent 2: Allocate items 4 (92), 3 (69)
   - Agent 3: Allocate items 5 (88), 7 (72)

4. **Allocate the Remaining Item**:
   - The remaining item is 8, which has a moderate value for Agent 3 (56), so we allocate item 8 to Agent 3.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while attempting to maximize the total valuation for each agent.
