Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  83   8  55   4  58  19  64  92
1  23  71   9  30  84  44  90   0  32
2  24  47  52  27   6  23  32  21   7
3  96  31  88  14  24   6  52  98  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's preferences, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We should aim to distribute the items in a way that is considered fair based on the agents' valuations.

Let's consider the following steps to allocate items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Determine the proportion of the total value each agent has and use this to guide initial allocation.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than 3 items (as 3 items per agent would be the fairest distribution given 9 items and 4 agents).

Let's go through this process:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Values

- Agent 0: 28 + 83 + 8 + 55 + 4 + 58 + 19 + 64 + 92 = 411
- Agent 1: 23 + 71 + 9 + 30 + 84 + 44 + 90 + 0 + 32 = 383
- Agent 2: 24 + 47 + 52 + 27 + 6 + 23 + 32 + 21 + 7 = 239
- Agent 3: 96 + 31 + 88 + 14 + 24 + 6 + 52 + 98 + 61 = 470

### Step 2: Proportionate Allocation

The total valuation sum is 411 + 383 + 239 + 470 = 1503. Here’s how we can proportionally distribute the items:

- Agent 0: 411/1503 ≈ 0.273
- Agent 1: 383/1503 ≈ 0.255
- Agent 2: 239/1503 ≈ 0.159
- Agent 3: 470/1503 ≈ 0.313

Based on these proportions, Agent 3 should get the most items, followed by Agent 0, Agent 1, and lastly, Agent 2.

### Step 3: Allocate Items

Let's assign items based on preferences and ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Items with highest values are 8 (92), 1 (83), and 7 (64). Assign [8, 1] to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Items with highest values are 6 (90), 4 (84), and 1 (71). Assign [6, 4] to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Items with highest values are 2 (52), 1 (47), and 6 (32). Assign [2] to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Items with highest values are 0 (96), 7 (98), 2 (88). Assign [0, 7, 3, 5] to Agent 3.

Due to constraints of integer allocation and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 7, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items based on the agents' valuations and the total number of items available. It ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.
