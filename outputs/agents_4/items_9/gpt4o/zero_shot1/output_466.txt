Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13   0  43  33  61  99  43   3  14
1  51   1  54  63  38  50  50  13  74
2  89  20  67  90  88  66  13   3  53
3  88  22  70  16  82  88  85  43  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents in a way that each agent receives a similar cumulative value, if possible.

Let's first calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 13 + 0 + 43 + 33 + 61 + 99 + 43 + 3 + 14 = 309
- Agent 1: 51 + 1 + 54 + 63 + 38 + 50 + 50 + 13 + 74 = 394
- Agent 2: 89 + 20 + 67 + 90 + 88 + 66 + 13 + 3 + 53 = 489
- Agent 3: 88 + 22 + 70 + 16 + 82 + 88 + 85 + 43 + 71 = 565

With these total valuations, we will try to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair portion based on their preferences.

Now let's try to allocate the items:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 5: 99
  - Item 4: 61
  - Total value = 160

- Agent 1:
  - Item 8: 74
  - Item 3: 63
  - Total value = 137

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 2: 67
  - Total value = 156

- Agent 3:
  - Item 7: 43
  - Item 6: 85
  - Item 1: 22
  - Total value = 150

This allocation gives each agent items worth a similar cumulative value, considering their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [8, 3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7, 6, 1]
}
```
