Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  58  32  32   5   8  30  71  53
1  74  41   0  55  13  55  13  36  13
2  57   9  87  35  69   8   0  17  79
3   0  15  45  81  75  30   3  11   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's calculate each agent's total valuation for all items to help guide our allocation:

- Agent 0: 4, 58, 32, 32, 5, 8, 30, 71, 53
  - Total: 293

- Agent 1: 74, 41, 0, 55, 13, 55, 13, 36, 13
  - Total: 300

- Agent 2: 57, 9, 87, 35, 69, 8, 0, 17, 79
  - Total: 361

- Agent 3: 0, 15, 45, 81, 75, 30, 3, 11, 1
  - Total: 261

Given these totals, we will assign items by considering the highest valuation preferences for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We also need to ensure that all 9 items are allocated. 

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Agent 2 highly values item 2 with 87. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 with 74. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 3 highly values item 3 with 81. Assign item 3 to agent 3.
4. Agent 2 highly values item 8 with 79. Assign item 8 to agent 2.
5. Agent 0 highly values item 7 with 71. Assign item 7 to agent 0.
6. Agent 3 highly values item 4 with 75. Assign item 4 to agent 3.
7. Agent 1 also values item 5 with 55. Assign item 5 to agent 1.
8. Agent 0 values item 1 with 58. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
9. Agent 2 values item 6 with 0, but itâ€™s available. Assign item 6 to agent 2.

This allocation attempts to balance the high valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 6, 8],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation covers all items and respects the constraints given.
