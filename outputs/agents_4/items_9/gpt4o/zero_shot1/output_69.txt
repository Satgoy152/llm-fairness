Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  97  22  39  61  18  83  85  73
1  82  98  97  74  65   1  14  87  69
2  56  12  39  12   7  15  98  16  87
3  46  38  16  81  31  63  30  28  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent receives about the same number of items, considering the total number of items and agents involved.

Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Rank the Valuations:** Start by ranking the valuations of each item for each agent.
2. **Allocate Items:** Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that the number of items each agent receives is relatively balanced.

Given the table provided, letâ€™s allocate the items:

- **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 1 (82).
- **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 1 (98).
- **Item 2** is most valued by Agent 1 (97).
- **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 3 (81).
- **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 1 (65).
- **Item 5** is most valued by Agent 3 (63).
- **Item 6** is most valued by Agent 2 (98).
- **Item 7** is most valued by Agent 1 (87).
- **Item 8** is most valued by Agent 2 (87).

Now, we need to ensure that the allocation is fair by distributing items equally:

- Agent 0: 0 items
- Agent 1: 4 items
- Agent 2: 2 items
- Agent 3: 3 items

Let's adjust to balance the allocation:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 0 instead of Agent 1.
  
Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4, 7]
- Agent 2: [6, 8]
- Agent 3: [3, 5]

Now, each agent has at least 2 items except for Agent 0, who has 1 item.

Here's the JSON format for the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 7],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
