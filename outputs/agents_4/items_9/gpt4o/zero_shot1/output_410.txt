Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81   1  68  74  48  67  65  75   1
1  94  45  64  78  28  97  91  37  49
2   9  16  65  95  19  73  38  13  34
3  90  90  33  75  68  17  61  16  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. We will consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total possible value. Here's one way to achieve a balanced allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (81), Item 3 (74), Item 2 (68)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (97), Item 6 (91), Item 3 (78)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (95), Item 5 (73), Item 2 (65)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (90), Item 1 (90), Item 3 (75)

Given these valuations, we can aim to allocate items to each agent based on their preferences while ensuring each gets items of substantial value.

Let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0, Item 2
- **Agent 1**: Item 5, Item 6
- **Agent 2**: Item 3, Item 8
- **Agent 3**: Item 1, Item 4, Item 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and that the distribution considers each agent's high-value preferences.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 4 agents.
