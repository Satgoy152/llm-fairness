Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  67   5  49  79  59  12  74  47
1  19  66  55  66  54  50   2  26  62
2  55  75   8  40  24   8  98  52  70
3  45  71  21  26  91  32  45  21  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the items. Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying the highest value an agent has for each item and allocate that item to the respective agent.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives approximately the same number of items, if possible.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it highest (77). Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it highest (75). Allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest (55). Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it highest (49). Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it highest (91). Allocate to Agent 3.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it highest (59). Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it highest (98). Allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it highest (74). Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it highest (70). Allocate to Agent 2.

Now, let's ensure a fair allocation by checking the distribution of items:

- Agent 0 has items: 0, 3, 5, 7 (4 items)
- Agent 1 has item: 2 (1 item)
- Agent 2 has items: 1, 6, 8 (3 items)
- Agent 3 has item: 4 (1 item)

This allocation is reasonably balanced given the constraints, as each agent receives at least one item and there is a focus on maximizing valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 6, 8],
    "3": [4]
}
```
