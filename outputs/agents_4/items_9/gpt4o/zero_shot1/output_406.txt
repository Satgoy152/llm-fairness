Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  29  76  86  83  74  74  86  75
1  93  61  57  79  27  95  72  29  91
2  97  60  44  96   1   4  84  30  14
3  99  54  96  22  72  48  43  57  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences. Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value 90
   - Item 3: Value 86
   - Item 8: Value 75

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1: Value 61
   - Item 5: Value 95

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 6: Value 84
   - Item 7: Value 30

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 2: Value 96
   - Item 4: Value 72

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items and ensures all 9 items are allocated. Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
