Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  93   4  74  92  82  91  72  58
1  47  89  22  54  72  69  43  86  38
2   9  78  32  19  74  26  74  12  90
3  38  86  16  27  36  12  11  66  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share in terms of value. We should also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's start by analyzing the table of valuations:

```
Agent 0:  44  93   4  74  92  82  91  72  58
Agent 1:  47  89  22  54  72  69  43  86  38
Agent 2:   9  78  32  19  74  26  74  12  90
Agent 3:  38  86  16  27  36  12  11  66  37
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we can follow a strategy where each agent gets items they value highly while ensuring the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items that agent 0 values highly, such as items 1, 4, and 6. 
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items that agent 1 values highly, such as items 0, 7, and 3.
- **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 8 the most, so we can allocate that to them.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items that agent 3 values relatively highly, such as items 5 and 2.

With this allocation, each agent gets a fair share in terms of their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated. Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 7, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value, and the total number of items is exactly 9, distributed fairly among all agents.
