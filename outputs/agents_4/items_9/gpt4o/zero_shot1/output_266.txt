Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  39  30  96  11  98  61  87   3
1  79  43   3  49  32  45  96  98  34
2  14  33  80  72  18  44  21  71  33
3  32  16  33  96  38  92   4  30  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations for each item, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. This approach involves assigning items to agents based on who values them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Evaluate the highest value each agent places on each item.
2. Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
3. Adjust the allocation to ensure every item is distributed and no agent receives more than necessary.

Here's one way to fairly distribute the items:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 5, and 7.
- Agent 1 gets items 6 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 8.
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 4.

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
