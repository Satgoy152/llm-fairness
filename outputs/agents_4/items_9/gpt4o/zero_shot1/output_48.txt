Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3   6  75  96  55  46  16  29  47
1  35  49  50  41  99   0  76  24  40
2  48  10  77  84  42  22  22  98   1
3  86  86  28  96  81  37  59   7  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent receives a reasonable share of their preferred items. One approach is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. Here’s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 and 2 highly, so we can start by allocating these items to them.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4, so we allocate that to them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 highly, so we can allocate that to them.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 and 1 equally high, so we allocate these items to them.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 5, 6, and 8.

5. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 6, so it’s reasonable to allocate item 6 to them.
6. **Agent 2** can receive item 5, as they have a moderately high valuation for it compared to others.
7. **Agent 3** can get item 8, as they have the second-highest valuation for that item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 1, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of items based on their valuations, with each agent receiving at least one item.
