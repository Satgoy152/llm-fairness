Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  51  10  20  63  69  58  27  73
1  84  90  93  50  61  68  26  29  31
2  44  31  41  86  78  48  42  85  55
3  40  52  25  43  44  43  97  63  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one common approach is to use a method that maximizes overall satisfaction or utility. This often involves ensuring that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also balancing the total number of items each agent receives. Here, I'll consider each agent's top preferences and try to distribute the items accordingly.

Here's one way to do it:

1. Evaluate the highest value each agent has for the items.
2. Assign each agent the item they value the most, provided it hasn't already been assigned.
3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

### Allocation Process

- Agent 0 values item 8 the highest (73). Assign item 8 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (93). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (86). Assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (97). Assign item 6 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated one item to each agent. Continue by assigning the next highest valued item to each agent:

- Agent 0's next highest is item 5 (69). Assign item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1's next highest is item 1 (90). Assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2's next highest is item 4 (78). Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3's next highest is item 7 (63). Assign item 7 to agent 3.

At this point, the total allocated items are 8, so we have one more item left to allocate. Let's assign the remaining item 0 to the agent who values it the most and hasn't reached their highest capacity of preference satisfaction:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 1 (84), but agent 1 already has 2 items, so let's assign it to agent 2, who values it second highest (44).

### Final Allocations

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3, 4, 0],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair amount of their valued items, with all 9 items allocated among the 4 agents.
