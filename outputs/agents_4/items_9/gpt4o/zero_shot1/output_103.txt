Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  61  71   8  81   1  12  10  14
1  91  29  70  57  72  93  99   0  61
2  69  80  60  35  52  35   5  91  99
3  94  80   0  75  92  21  78  21  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable allocation. We can start by analyzing the valuations and making allocations that maximize each agent's total value. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
    - Choose items with high valuations for Agent 0: Items 4 and 2 (values 81 and 71).
    - Total value: 81 + 71 = 152

2. Agent 1:
    - Choose items with high valuations for Agent 1: Items 0 and 5 (values 91 and 93).
    - Total value: 91 + 93 = 184

3. Agent 2:
    - Choose items with high valuations for Agent 2: Items 7 and 8 (values 91 and 99).
    - Total value: 91 + 99 = 190

4. Agent 3:
    - Choose items with high valuations for Agent 3: Items 3 and 6 (values 75 and 78).
    - Total value: 75 + 78 = 153

Now, ensure each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Items 7, 8
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6

This allocation fairly distributes the items based on the agents' valuations. The JSON format of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
