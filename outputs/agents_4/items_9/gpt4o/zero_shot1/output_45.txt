Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  47  51  16  50  50  10  57  38
1  60  84  28  10  20  43  57  96  58
2   5  35  93  56  26  85  61  69   5
3  86  67  98  96  87  78  33  41  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 47 51 16 50 50 10 57 38]
 [60 84 28 10 20 43 57 96 58]
 [ 5 35 93 56 26 85 61 69  5]
 [86 67 98 96 87 78 33 41 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Given the valuations, one approach is to try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [75, 47, 51, 16, 50, 50, 10, 57, 38]
   - Allocate items with the highest values: Items 0, 1, and 4 (values: 75, 47, 50)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [60, 84, 28, 10, 20, 43, 57, 96, 58]
   - Allocate items with the highest values: Items 7 and 5 (values: 96, 43)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [5, 35, 93, 56, 26, 85, 61, 69, 5]
   - Allocate items with the highest values: Items 2 and 6 (values: 93, 61)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [86, 67, 98, 96, 87, 78, 33, 41, 13]
   - Allocate items with the highest values: Items 3 and 8 (values: 96, 13)

This allocation is aimed at maximizing the total satisfaction for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution of items. The allocation of items is completed for all agents with each agent receiving a fair share.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 8]
}
```
