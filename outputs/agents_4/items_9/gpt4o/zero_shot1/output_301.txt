Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  28  57  93  49  43  70  28  75
1  44  10  16  41  26  28  95  90   8
2  72  59  42  60  18  80  36  62  87
3  54  63  95  24  29  37  24  86  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable value based on their preferences while also making sure that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. We can aim to maximize the total value for the agents while ensuring a balanced distribution. Here's one way to make the allocations:

1. Start by finding the highest value each agent has for any item and try to assign those items to them if possible.
2. Then, allocate the remaining items based on maximizing the overall satisfaction.

Let's work through the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value of 93 for item 3.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value of 95 for item 6.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value of 87 for item 8.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest value of 95 for item 2.

Now, we allocate the remaining items:

5. **Item 0** can go to Agent 2, who values it at 72 (second highest after item 8).
6. **Item 1** can go to Agent 3, who values it at 63 (next highest available after item 2).
7. **Item 4** can go to Agent 0, who values it at 49 (next highest available after item 3).
8. **Item 5** can go to Agent 2, who values it at 80 (after item 0 and 8).
9. **Item 7** can go to Agent 3, who values it at 86 (after item 2 and 1).

Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 5, 8],
    "3": [1, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable number of items with a focus on maximizing their individual satisfaction based on their valuations.
