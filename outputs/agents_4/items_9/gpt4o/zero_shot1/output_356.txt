Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  47   3  93  98  37  81  92  60
1  54  25   8  69  32  98  25  46  52
2  23  74  44  46  71  34   9  58  88
3  54   0   9  26   6  92  40   9  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no more than three items, as there are 9 items and 4 agents.

Let's examine each agent's highest valued items and try to distribute them fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 3 (93), Item 7 (92)
   - Allocate Items: 4, 3, 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 5 (98), Item 0 (54)
   - Allocate Items: 5, 0

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 8 (88), Item 1 (74)
   - Allocate Items: 8, 1

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: Item 6 (40), Item 2 (9)
   - Allocate Items: 6, 2

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: [4, 3, 7]
- **Agent 1**: [5, 0]
- **Agent 2**: [8, 1]
- **Agent 3**: [6, 2]

This distribution ensures that all 9 items are allocated, each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is made such that the total valuation is maximized for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 7],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [8, 1],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```
