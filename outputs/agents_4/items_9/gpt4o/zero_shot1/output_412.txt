Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  28  49  86  52  10  24  36  86
1  83  80  22  24  69  51  96  84  13
2   2  92  75  65  82  11  92  50  89
3  26  96   7  94  80  40  64  22  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable number of items based on their preferences, while ensuring that the total number of allocated items equals 9. We'll consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Let's walk through a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 8.
2. **Agent 1** values items 0, 1, and 6 highly.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
4. **Agent 3** values items 1, 3, and 4 highly.

A possible allocation considering these preferences could be:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 8
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, and 4
- Agent 3: Item 7 and 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value, and the total number of items allocated is 9. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and distributes the items in a way that aims to maximize overall satisfaction.
