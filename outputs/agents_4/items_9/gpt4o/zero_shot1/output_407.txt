Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  38  64  20  77  54  15  85  66
1  74  30  48  40  37  22  61  19  21
2  29  58  31  41  19  12  33  80   4
3  46  51  22  16  64  15  36   3   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure each agent receives a reasonable share of items based on their preferences. One approach is to start by allocating items with the highest valuations for each agent and then adjust to ensure each agent gets a fair distribution.

Let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the highest value item for each agent and allocate it to them if possible.
2. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to balance the distribution fairly.

Here is a potential fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items with high valuations such as 7 and 4.
- Agent 1: Allocate items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2: Allocate items 1 and 3.
- Agent 3: Allocate items 5, 6, and 8.

This allocation ensures each agent gets some of their preferred items while distributing all 9 items fairly:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5, 6, 8]
}
```

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent receives according to their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
