Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  73  23  57   3  19  36  11  34
1  35  14  55  80  36  64  69  53  26
2  41  56  59  45  53  37  33  25  19
3  11  95  10  40  46  23  14   9  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable portion of their preferred items based on their valuations. A simple strategy is to use a round-robin method, where agents take turns to choose their highest-valued available item. This can help distribute the items in a way that respects their preferences.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 takes item 0 (value 98).
   - Agent 1 takes item 3 (value 80).
   - Agent 2 takes item 2 (value 59).
   - Agent 3 takes item 1 (value 95).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 takes item 3 (value 57), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 1 (value 73), but it's also taken. Takes item 6 (value 36).
   - Agent 1 takes item 5 (value 64).
   - Agent 2 takes item 4 (value 53).
   - Agent 3 takes item 4 (value 46), but it's already taken. Takes item 7 (value 9).

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 0 takes item 2 (value 23), but it's already taken. Takes item 8 (value 34).
   - Agent 1 takes item 6 (value 69), but it's already taken. Takes item 7 (value 53), but it's already taken. Takes item 8 (value 26).
   - Agent 2 has no items left to choose from.
   - Agent 3 has no items left to choose from.

After considering the constraints and avoiding conflicts, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 8],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
