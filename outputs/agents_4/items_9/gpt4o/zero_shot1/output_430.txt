Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  53  55  83  73  63  28   8  35
1  27  81   3  53  17  37  46  42  28
2  13  96  94  66  82  78  14  13  20
3  41   1  23  98  25  42  44  70  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we will aim to distribute them such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. We'll consider the valuations provided for each agent and try to assign items to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are assigned.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: We'll allocate items with high value for this agent. Items 3 and 4 have higher valuations for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: We'll allocate items with high value for this agent. Items 1 and 7 have high valuations for agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: We'll allocate items with high value for this agent. Items 2 and 5 have high valuations for agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: We'll allocate items with high value for this agent. Items 0, 6, and 8 have relatively higher valuations for agent 3.

Following this strategy, the allocation can be structured like this:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated, each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution of items considers the valuation each agent has for them.
