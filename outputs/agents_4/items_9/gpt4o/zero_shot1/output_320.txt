Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  85  42  40  62  59  77  45  23
1  61  75  70  40  29  39  46  99  41
2  61  24  40  36  21  62   0  65   6
3  69  74  78  82  72  68  13  80  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 9 items to the 4 agents in a way that is fair, meaning each agent should receive an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 4 agents, some agents may receive more items than others.

We will aim to distribute the items such that the total value of items allocated to each agent is balanced as much as possible. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent should ideally get either 2 or 3 items because there are 9 items and 4 agents.
   - We will focus on maximizing each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations in a way that keeps the total number of items allocated equal to 9.
   - Try to ensure that no agent is left too dissatisfied compared to others.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Start by assigning each agent their most valued item.
   - Continue assigning next highest valued items while monitoring the number of items each agent gets.
   - Adjust allocations as needed to maintain fairness and integer item counts.

Let's try allocating the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 6, and 4.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 7, 0, and 2.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5, 7, and 0.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3, 7, and 8.

To balance the allocations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, continue the allocation:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 since Agent 3 has high valuations for 3 items and needs more items to balance.

Finally, allocate the last item:

- Assign item 8 to Agent 2 to balance the item count.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [7, 0],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [3, 2, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair share in terms of the number of items and tries to optimize their total valuation.
