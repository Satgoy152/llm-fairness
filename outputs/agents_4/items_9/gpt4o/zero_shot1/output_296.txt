Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  75  42  18  39  98  62  94  40
1  19  56  33  94  13  93  63  31  59
2  63   8  29  47  89  35  68  85  44
3  40  80  34  43  78  85  72  71  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items in a way that balances total value each agent receives. A potential approach is to assign items by maximizing the value each agent receives while ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item, if possible.

Here is one possible allocation based on maximizing the total value each agent receives:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value: 98).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value: 94).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value: 89).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value: 80).
5. Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value: 94).
6. Assign item 8 to agent 2 (value: 44).
7. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value: 33).
8. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value: 72).
9. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value: 15).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while maximizing the total value for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 0],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
