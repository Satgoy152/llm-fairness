Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  52  92  69   4   7  58  23  75
1  84  11  85  99  52  84   8   3  39
2  33  71  76  77  53  99   9  87  27
3  29  25  48   3  76  21  43  96  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items, and 4 agents, we can start by trying to allocate 2 items to each agent and then distribute the remaining item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Look for the top two items with the highest valuations.
   - Valuations: [31, 52, 92, 69, 4, 7, 58, 23, 75]
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (92), Item 8 (75)

2. **Agent 1**: Look for the top two items with the highest valuations.
   - Valuations: [84, 11, 85, 99, 52, 84, 8, 3, 39]
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 0 (84)

3. **Agent 2**: Look for the top two items with the highest valuations.
   - Valuations: [33, 71, 76, 77, 53, 99, 9, 87, 27]
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (99), Item 7 (87)

4. **Agent 3**: Look for the top two items with the highest valuations.
   - Valuations: [29, 25, 48, 3, 76, 21, 43, 96, 58]
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (96), Item 4 (76)

5. **Allocate remaining item**: 
   - Remaining items after initial allocation: Item 1, Item 4, Item 6
   - Check which remaining item provides the highest value to any agent who hasn't already filled their quota:
     - For Item 1:
       - Agent 0: 52
       - Agent 1: 11
       - Agent 2: 71
       - Agent 3: 25
     - For Item 4:
       - Agent 0: 4
       - Agent 1: 52
       - Agent 2: 53
       - Agent 3: 76
     - For Item 6:
       - Agent 0: 58
       - Agent 1: 8
       - Agent 2: 9
       - Agent 3: 43

   - Allocate based on the highest valuation for remaining items:
     - Item 4 to Agent 3 (value 76)

Based on this allocation, the JSON format will be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [4, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
