Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  66  24  90  71  63  43  93  12
1  33   3  26  21  58  52  96  37  28
2  48  14  74  74  27  78  10   6  98
3   9  19  23  32  63  57  85  13  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Given the table of valuations, a possible approach is to allocate items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent has an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 highly with 93, so item 7 goes to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 highly with 96, so item 6 goes to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 8 highly with 98, so item 8 goes to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly with 63, so item 4 goes to Agent 3.
5. Agent 0 values item 3 highly with 90, so item 3 goes to Agent 0.
6. Agent 2 values item 5 highly with 78, so item 5 goes to Agent 2.
7. Agent 0 values item 1 highly with 66, so item 1 goes to Agent 0.
8. Agent 3 values item 2 with 23, which is the highest among remaining options, so item 2 goes to Agent 3.
9. Agent 1 values item 0 with 33, which is the highest among remaining options, so item 0 goes to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the value each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
