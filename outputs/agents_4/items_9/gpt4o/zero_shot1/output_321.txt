Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  66  44  30  96  67  45  18  45
1  72  26  37  59  24  29  54  48  26
2  76  24   9   3  34  34  62  37  79
3  10  47  74  45  12  93  25  64  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of all agents, considering their valuations. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 71 + 66 + 44 + 30 + 96 + 67 + 45 + 18 + 45 = 482
- Agent 1: 72 + 26 + 37 + 59 + 24 + 29 + 54 + 48 + 26 = 375
- Agent 2: 76 + 24 + 9 + 3 + 34 + 34 + 62 + 37 + 79 = 358
- Agent 3: 10 + 47 + 74 + 45 + 12 + 93 + 25 + 64 + 19 = 389

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4, 0, 1.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 3, 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 8, 0, 6.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 5, 2, 7.

Considering these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 8, 6
- Agent 3: Items 5, 2, 7

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [8, 6],
    "3": [5, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and aims to maximize the overall satisfaction given the agents' valuations.
