Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  11  37  35  92  11  83  63  29
1  45  55  37  18   7  31  85  37  72
2  66  68  42  98  36   9   2  62  12
3  31   7  91  60  14  82  40  99  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 11 37 35 92 11 83 63 29]
 [45 55 37 18  7 31 85 37 72]
 [66 68 42 98 36  9  2 62 12]
 [31  7 91 60 14 82 40 99 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and balance the total value each agent receives. Given that there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive about 2 to 3 items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 4, 6 (Highest values for Agent 0)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 0, 7 (Balanced high values for Agent 1)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 3, 1 (High values for Agent 2)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: 2, 5, 8 (High values for Agent 3)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [2, 5, 8]
}
```
