Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  75  81  13  44  74  20  55   6
1  55  48  50  13  35  51  81  94  14
2   0  76  82  75  36  68  49  50  29
3  97  94  32  14  57  89  38  90  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 9. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent gets or to ensure a balanced distribution based on their preferences. Let's aim for a fair distribution by considering the preferences and attempting to balance the allocations.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly, so we can allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 highly, so we can allocate item 7 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly, so we can allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 highly, so we can allocate item 0 to agent 3.

After allocating these high-value items, we distribute the remaining items to ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item:

5. Allocate item 1 to agent 2 (second highest value for agent 2).
6. Allocate item 4 to agent 0 (relatively high value for agent 0).
7. Allocate item 5 to agent 3 (relatively high value for agent 3).
8. Allocate item 6 to agent 1 (high value for agent 1).
9. Allocate item 8 to agent 1 (as agent 1 has a lower total valuation).

Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [7, 6, 8],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair amount based on their preferences.
