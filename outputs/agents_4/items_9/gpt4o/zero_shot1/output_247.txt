Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  25  54  68  45  12  72  48  90
1  74   7  84  59  55  61  55  56  23
2  14  61  25  16  55  68  43  99  41
3  33  32  84  47  69  86  71  95  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations and perform a fair allocation:

### Step 1: Assign the highest valued items to each agent

- Agent 0 values item 8 the most at 90.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 84.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most at 99.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most at 86.

Assign these items first:

- Agent 0 gets item 8.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 7.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.

### Step 2: Distribute remaining items based on remaining high valuations

After assigning the highest valued items, let's allocate the rest by looking at the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0's next highest is item 6 at 72.
- Agent 1's next highest is item 0 at 74.
- Agent 2's next highest is item 5 at 68, but it's already taken, so item 1 at 61.
- Agent 3's next highest is item 7 at 95, but it's already taken, so item 4 at 69.

Assign these items:

- Agent 0 gets item 6.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.

### Step 3: Allocate remaining items

Since each agent now has 2 items, we need to assign the last item to one of them. The remaining items are 3 and 9:

- Item 3 has these valuations: 68 (Agent 0), 59 (Agent 1), 16 (Agent 2), 47 (Agent 3).
- Item 9 has these valuations: 90 (Agent 0), 23 (Agent 1), 41 (Agent 2), 24 (Agent 3).

Agent 0 values item 3 the most, so they should receive it.

Now each agent has 2 items, and we have allocated all 9 items:

- Agent 0: 8, 6, 3
- Agent 1: 2, 0
- Agent 2: 7, 1
- Agent 3: 5, 4

### Final allocations

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6, 3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [7, 1],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```
