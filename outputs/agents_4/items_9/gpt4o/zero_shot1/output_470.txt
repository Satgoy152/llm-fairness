Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  19  56  63  26  13  97  35  99
1  34  39  78  21  11  73  48   4  32
2  36  85  42  71  37   7  92  73  36
3  56  29  92  95  12   2  44  88  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by ensuring that each agent gets items they value more highly, while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item is 99 (item 8).
   - Next highest is 97 (item 6).
   - Allocate items 8 and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item is 78 (item 2).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item is 85 (item 1).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item is 95 (item 3).
   - Next highest is 92 (item 2), but item 2 is already taken.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 5 items: [8, 6, 2, 1, 3]. We need to allocate the remaining 4 items.

5. **Remaining items**: [0, 4, 5, 7]

   - Item 0:
     - High valuation for Agent 0 (59) and Agent 3 (56). Given Agent 0 already has two items, allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
   - Item 4:
     - Highest valuation is Agent 2 (37).
     - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Item 5:
     - Highest valuation is Agent 1 (73).
     - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Item 7:
     - Highest valuation is Agent 3 (88).
     - Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 0, 7]
}
```
