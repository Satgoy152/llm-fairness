Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  27  11  88  88  37  47  53  17
1  30  12  35  73  39  73  12  65  18
2  56  41  78  71   1  80  48  73  88
3  85  58  99   1  42  11  89  37  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a roughly equal total valuation. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Allocated items: [0, 3]
    - Total valuation: 58 (Item 0) + 88 (Item 3) = 146

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Allocated items: [1, 7]
    - Total valuation: 12 (Item 1) + 65 (Item 7) = 77

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Allocated items: [2, 6, 8]
    - Total valuation: 78 (Item 2) + 48 (Item 6) + 88 (Item 8) = 214

4. **Agent 3**: 
    - Allocated items: [4, 5]
    - Total valuation: 42 (Item 4) + 11 (Item 5) = 53

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 6, 8],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least some items, with the total number of items allocated being 9.
