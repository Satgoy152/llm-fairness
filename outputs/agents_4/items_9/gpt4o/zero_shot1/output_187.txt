Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  12  53  66  22  17  59  67  24
1  72  89  22  20  87  54  58  73  21
2  88  59  91  52  18  27  53  93  47
3  72  57  95  51  37   9  50   3   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent derives from their assigned items. Here's one way to do it while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Start by calculating the total values for each potential allocation, considering the value each agent has for each item.
2. Assign items to agents based on the highest value the agent has for any unallocated item, ensuring every agent gets at least one item.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are allocated and the distribution is fair.

Given the table of values, let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 and item 7 highly, both at 67. 
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 89.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2 at 91.
- Agent 3 highly values item 3 at 95.

Let's assign these items first:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3]

Now, distribute the remaining items [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] considering each agent's total value to maximize the overall satisfaction:

- Item 4 is valued most by Agent 1 at 87.
- Item 5 is valued most by Agent 1 at 54.
- Item 6 is valued most by Agent 0 at 59.
- Item 7 is still available and is valued most by Agent 2 at 93.
- Item 8 is valued most by Agent 2 at 47.

Assign the remaining items:

- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 7, 8]
- Agent 3: [3]

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 7, 8],
    "3": [3]
}
```
