Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  33  45  36  93  64  64   1  26
1  35   3   4  73  57  98  29  40  35
2  74  29  99  72  55  51  87  58  57
3   0  11  23  74  77  68  52  61  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35  3  4 73 57 98 29 40 35]

 [ 0 11 23 74 77 68 52 61 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total value derived from the items they receive. Let's distribute the items based on maximizing the agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (value of 93).
   - Next highest values for Agent 0 are items 5 and 6 (both valued at 64).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (value of 98).
   - Next highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 (value of 73).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value of 99).
   - Next highest values for Agent 2 are items 0 and 6, but item 6 is already selected by Agent 0, so item 0 (value of 74).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 4 the most, but item 4 is already selected by Agent 0.
   - Next highest value for Agent 3 is item 3, but item 3 is already selected by Agent 1.
   - Next highest available value for Agent 3 is item 7 (value of 61).

Now, let's finalize the allocations ensuring each item is allocated only once and each agent can receive an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: [4, 6]
- Agent 1: [5, 3]
- Agent 2: [2, 0]
- Agent 3: [7, 8, 1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair allocation based on their valuations. Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [7, 8, 1]
}
```
