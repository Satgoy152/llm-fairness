Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  56  95  18  45  69  85  21  60
1  78  49  11  43  39  18  78  43  92
2  89  72  84  54  38  80  93  18  40
3  63  93  21  46  29  37  33   3  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an approximately equal number of items. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 3 items and the others will receive 2 items each. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value items for each agent.
2. Try to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is maximized.
3. Ensure that each agent gets at least 2 items, and one agent receives 3 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest, followed by item 6.
- Agent 1 values item 8 the highest, followed by item 0.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest, followed by item 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest, followed by item 0.

To prevent conflicts and ensure fair distribution:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (since it's highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 2, but Agent 0 values it the most).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (as it's highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 2, but Agent 2 values it more).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (it's the highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (it's the highest value item for Agent 3).

Now distribute the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest for Agent 1, and Agent 3 already has item 1).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (second highest remaining for Agent 2).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest remaining for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 needs one more item to have 3 in total).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 7],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
