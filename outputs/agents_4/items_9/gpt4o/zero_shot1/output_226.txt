Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  66  68  95  79  14  90   5  80
1   2  68  37  19  84  56  94  85  59
2  87  23  96  15  98  94  70  58  35
3  69  74  43  53  45  53  99  82  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that balances the total valuations each agent receives. We will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal share of the overall value.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by calculating the total value each agent can receive if they get their most valued items.
2. Gradually assign items to each agent, ensuring that each agent's allocation remains as balanced as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items: 0 (93), 3 (95), 6 (90), 8 (80).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items: 4 (84), 6 (94), 7 (85).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items: 2 (96), 4 (98), 5 (94).
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items: 1 (74), 6 (99), 7 (82).

Based on these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0:** [0, 3]
- **Agent 1:** [4, 7]
- **Agent 2:** [2, 5]
- **Agent 3:** [1, 6, 8]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that are valuable to them while maintaining balance.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1, 6, 8]
}
```
