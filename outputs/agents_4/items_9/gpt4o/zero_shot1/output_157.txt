Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  54  79   6  55  85  82  85  35
1   1  80  19  90  10  82  67   9  23
2  19  56  39  20  11  23  79  51  89
3  23  78  55  35  17  50   4  11  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations and attempt to distribute items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents as much as possible, given the constraints.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify the items that have the highest value for each agent, and try to allocate those items to the respective agents.
2. Consider the remaining items and distribute them to ensure each agent gets approximately an equal number of items, while also considering their value preferences.

Let's attempt to distribute the items accordingly:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest, followed by items 6 and 7. 
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, followed by item 1.
- Agent 2 values item 8 the highest, followed by item 6.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest, followed by item 2.

We can allocate items as follows:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 0.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. Assign item 8 to agent 2.
4. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. Assign item 6 to agent 0 for their second-highest preference.
6. Assign item 0 to agent 0 since it's also highly valued by them.
7. Assign item 2 to agent 3 as they also have a relatively high value for it.
8. Assign item 4 to agent 1.
9. Assign item 7 to agent 2.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their preferences as much as possible.
