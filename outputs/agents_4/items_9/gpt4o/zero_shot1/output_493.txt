Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  61  31  19  29  39  25   1   9
1  98  46  43   1  39  59  53  25  51
2  85  98   6  81  49  44  96  38  88
3  79  40  12   4  99  74  66  17  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Given the constraints, we can use a greedy approach to allocate items by choosing the highest value for each agent in turns to ensure fairness.

Let's analyze the values:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest values: 72 (Item 0), 61 (Item 1)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: 98 (Item 0), 59 (Item 5)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: 98 (Item 1), 96 (Item 6)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest values: 99 (Item 4), 80 (Item 8)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Allocate the highest value item to each agent in turns:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 0 (value 72)
   - Agent 1 gets Item 5 (value 59)
   - Agent 2 gets Item 6 (value 96)
   - Agent 3 gets Item 4 (value 99)

2. Allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 3, 7, 8) fairly:

   - Agent 1 gets Item 2 (value 43)
   - Agent 3 gets Item 8 (value 80)
   - Agent 0 gets Item 1 (value 61)
   - Agent 2 gets Item 3 (value 81)
   - Agent 0 gets Item 7 (value 1)

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [4, 8]
}
```
