Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12   3  77  78  25  63  96   6  14
1  57  48  54  10  20   8  61  32  92
2  57   3  47   6  42  40  62  60   8
3  72  77  12  60  80  97   6  44  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent can be allocated between 2 to 3 items. We can try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Looking at the valuations of Agent 0, the items with the highest value are item 6 (96), item 3 (78), and item 2 (77). Allocate items 6, 3, and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** For Agent 1, the highest-valued items are item 8 (92), item 0 (57), and item 2 (54). Since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, allocate items 8 and 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 6 (62), item 7 (60), and item 4 (42) highly. Item 6 is already allocated to Agent 0, so allocate items 7 and 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** Agent 3 values item 5 (97), item 4 (80), and item 1 (77) highly. Items 4 and 1 are not yet allocated, so allocate items 5 and 1 to Agent 3.

With this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 3, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [8, 0]
- Agent 2: Items [7, 4]
- Agent 3: Items [5, 1]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 2],
    "1": [8, 0],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```
