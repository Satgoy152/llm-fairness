Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  52  32  49  28  53   0  41   6
1  32  35  90  33  23  57  49  62  57
2  84  16   1  20   4  81  87  57  29
3  72  75  63  68  89  23  98  24  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a roughly equal share of the total valuation. Here's a potential allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Distribute items in a way that attempts to equalize these total valuations as much as possible while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's perform this allocation:

1. Calculate total valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 35 + 52 + 32 + 49 + 28 + 53 + 0 + 41 + 6 = 296
   - Agent 1: 32 + 35 + 90 + 33 + 23 + 57 + 49 + 62 + 57 = 438
   - Agent 2: 84 + 16 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 81 + 87 + 57 + 29 = 379
   - Agent 3: 72 + 75 + 63 + 68 + 89 + 23 + 98 + 24 + 39 = 551

2. Allocate items to balance these valuations as much as possible:

- Agent 0: [0, 1] (Value: 35 + 52 = 87)
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 8] (Value: 90 + 23 + 57 = 170)
- Agent 2: [5, 6] (Value: 81 + 87 = 168)
- Agent 3: [3, 7] (Value: 68 + 24 = 92)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
