Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  96  61  63  84  34  15  47  75
1  76  25   3  74  37  20  48  41  34
2  57   0  54   7  93  94  29  90  41
3   0  71  79  15  79  35   7  38  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we need to consider a balanced distribution, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 4 agents, we can aim to distribute the items roughly evenly, with some agents receiving 2 items and others receiving 3 items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign items with the highest valuations to agents who value them most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least 2 items, with one receiving an additional item to make up the total of 9.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, 4.
- Agent 1: Has high valuations for items 0, 3, 6.
- Agent 2: Has high valuations for items 4, 5, 7.
- Agent 3: Has high valuations for items 1, 2, 4.

One possible fair distribution could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Items 5, 7
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4, 8

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable number of items, and all 9 items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [2, 4, 8]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations as much as possible while evenly distributing the number of items.
