Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  68  22   3  48  64  91  49   8
1  58  90  76  25  13  63  43  46  73
2  38  19  61  93  14  15  34  99   7
3  80  95  51  53  13  46   1  43  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 68 22  3 48 64 91 49  8]
 [58 90 76 25 13 63 43 46 73]
 [38 19 61 93 14 15 34 99  7]
 [80 95 51 53 13 46  1 43 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valuations: 0 (94), 6 (91)
   - Allocate items 0 and 6 to agent 0.

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuations: 1 (90), 2 (76)
   - Allocate items 1 and 2 to agent 1.

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuations: 7 (99), 3 (93)
   - Allocate items 7 and 3 to agent 2.

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest valuations: 8 (99), 1 (95)
   - Allocate items 8 and 4 to agent 3.

Now, let's verify:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are allocated, but we need to ensure only 9 items in total are allocated.
- Re-evaluating ensures all agents get at least one item. Adjusting for fairness:

Revised allocations:
- Agent 0: 0, 6
- Agent 1: 1, 2
- Agent 2: 7, 3
- Agent 3: 8, 4

Now, let's present the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [8, 4]
}
```
