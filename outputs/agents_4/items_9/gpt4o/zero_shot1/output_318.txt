Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  22  82  70  77   9  81   6  13
1  49  37  53  74  74  40  54  28  21
2  19  82  60  48  50  21  71  39  51
3   9  29  11  53  46  42  33  49  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the utility for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 9 items are allocated. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - This agent values items 0, 2, 6 the most. Allocating these items would maximize their utility.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - This agent values items 3 and 4 the most. Allocating these items would be beneficial for them.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - This agent values items 1 and 8 the most. Allocating these items suits them well.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - This agent values items 5 and 7 the most. Allocating these items would be beneficial for them.

Here is the allocation based on maximizing the utility for each agent:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents while maximizing the value each agent receives from their allocation.
