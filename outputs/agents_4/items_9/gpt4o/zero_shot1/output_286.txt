Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  64  90  97  56  55  78  43  98
1  32  83  41  69  80   5   6  68  81
2  83  63  28  31  18  90  76  51  14
3  66  16  68   8   7  10   9  81  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's consider the valuations and try to distribute the items to maximize fairness.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total number of items (in this case, 9 items).

Let's proceed with these steps:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 3 and 8.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 5 and 6.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 7.

Now, we need to assign the remaining items while ensuring fairness:

- Agent 0 also has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 can also get item 4.
- Agent 3 can receive item 2 (since Agent 0 already has a fair share).

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 8
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 5, 6
- Agent 3: Items 2, 7

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly, with each agent receiving at least one item, and maximizes the valuation based on the given data.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```
