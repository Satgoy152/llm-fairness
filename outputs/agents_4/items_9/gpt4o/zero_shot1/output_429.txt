Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  47  40  29   4  50   6  11  11
1  34  54  83  10  72   3  61  21  95
2  66  91  74  90  15  57  71   1  60
3  96  60  23  42  10  56  28  55  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one common approach is to use the method of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 9. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 0 (95). 
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 8 (95).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 3 (90).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 0 (96), but since item 0 is already taken by Agent 0, the next highest is item 1 (60).

This approach ensures that each agent gets at least one of their top-valued items. Now, allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest available valuations for each agent:

5. **Agent 0**: Next highest available is item 1 (47), followed by item 2 (40).
6. **Agent 1**: Next highest available is item 6 (61).
7. **Agent 2**: Next highest available is item 5 (57).
8. **Agent 3**: Next highest available is item 7 (55).

Allocations so far:
- Agent 0: 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1: 8, 6
- Agent 2: 3, 5
- Agent 3: 1, 7

Now, ensure all items are allocated. Item 4 is unallocated and has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (72).

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: 0
- Agent 1: 8, 6, 4
- Agent 2: 3, 5
- Agent 3: 1, 7, 2

Converting this allocation into JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [8, 6, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1, 7, 2]
}
```
