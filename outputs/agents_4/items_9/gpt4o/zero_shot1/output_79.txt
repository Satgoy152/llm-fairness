Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  79  40  20   9  95  67  38  49
1  11  70  81  77  33  54  17  15  73
2  28  15   4  88   2  60  11  75  12
3  12  87  55  19  93   3  14  28  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of items based on their valuations. Here, we will attempt to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's first consider some possible allocations based on the given valuation matrix:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: 95 (item 5), 84 (item 0), 79 (item 1)
   - Allocate item 5 (95) to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: 81 (item 2), 77 (item 3), 73 (item 8)
   - Allocate item 2 (81) to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: 88 (item 3), 75 (item 7), 60 (item 5)
   - Allocate item 3 (88) to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: 95 (item 8), 93 (item 4), 87 (item 1)
   - Allocate item 8 (95) to agent 3.

Now, consider the remaining items and allocate them to balance the overall distribution while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate item 0 (84) to agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate item 1 (70) to agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate item 7 (75) to agent 2.

8. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocate item 4 (93) to agent 3.

9. **Agent 1**: 
   - Allocate item 6 (17) to agent 1 as it has the next highest valuation for agent 1 and balances the allocation.

Now each agent has received a fair share of items based on their preferences and the total number of items is allocated.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 1, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [8, 4]
}
```
