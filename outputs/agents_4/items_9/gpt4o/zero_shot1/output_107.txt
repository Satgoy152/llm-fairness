Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  31  49  36  48  66  85  37  96
1  47  45  38  90  15  54  97  13  75
2  67  79   4  82  65  63  98   6  76
3   6  60  96  60  57  61  42  30  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible), while also distributing the items evenly. There are 9 items to distribute among 4 agents, which means some agents will receive more items than others. 

A possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, but ensuring that the distribution remains relatively even. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. List all items and their values for each agent.
2. Sort these items by the highest value any agent places on them.
3. Allocate items to agents prioritizing the highest value and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Following this logic, here is one fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 6 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 8.
- Agent 2 receives items 5, 2, and 0.
- Agent 3 receives item 7 and 4.

Here's how the allocations look in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [5, 2, 0],
    "3": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.
