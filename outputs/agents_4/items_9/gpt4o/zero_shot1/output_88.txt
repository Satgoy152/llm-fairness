Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  77  10  12  16   4  94  37  19
1  78  70  75  12  17  27  48  65  32
2  94  45  34  43  17  78  85  30   5
3  30  43  59  34  43  55  81  90  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes the total satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent can get at least 2 items, and one agent can get an additional item to make the total 9 items.

Considering the table, let's allocate items by looking for the highest values for each agent while keeping the distribution as fair as possible:

1. **Agent 0's Allocation:**
   - Highest values: Item 6 (94), Item 1 (77)
   - Allocate items: [6, 1]

2. **Agent 1's Allocation:**
   - Highest values: Item 0 (78), Item 2 (75)
   - Allocate items: [0, 2]

3. **Agent 2's Allocation:**
   - Highest values: Item 0 (94), Item 5 (78)
   - Allocate item: [5]

4. **Agent 3's Allocation:**
   - Highest values: Item 7 (90), Item 6 (81)
   - Allocate items: [7, 3, 8]

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least 2 items. We need to adjust the allocation slightly so that Agent 2 also gets one more item:

- Reallocate Item 0 from Agent 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it highly (94) and Agent 1 can still have good value with their remaining items.

After these adjustments, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3, 7, 8]
}
```

This distribution gives each agent at least 2 items, with Agent 3 receiving 3 items to account for the total of 9 items.
