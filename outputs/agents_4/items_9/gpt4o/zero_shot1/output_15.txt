Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  26  70  94  37  26  37  72  60
1  68   2  55  48  10  12  30  87   9
2  77  35  37  18  81  14  13  93  85
3  60  14  74  13  23  94  30  60   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: item 3 (94), item 2 (70), item 0 (60)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: item 7 (87), item 0 (68), item 2 (55)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: item 7 (93), item 8 (85), item 4 (81)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: item 5 (94), item 2 (74), item 0 (60)

Now, we'll allocate the items by ensuring each agent gets items with relatively high values for them, and no item is assigned to more than one agent.

- **Agent 0**: item 3 (94), item 0 (60)
- **Agent 1**: item 7 (87), item 2 (55)
- **Agent 2**: item 8 (85), item 4 (81)
- **Agent 3**: item 5 (94), item 6 (30), item 1 (14)

This allocation maximizes the values for each agent while ensuring that each item is allocated once.

Here's your JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [8, 4],
    "3": [5, 6, 1]
}
```
