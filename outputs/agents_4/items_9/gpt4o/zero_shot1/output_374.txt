Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  25  98  35  70  40  66  73  87
1  82   8  12  90  87  53  48  28  56
2  65   5  14   3  86   0   2   0  74
3  55  93  66  37  91  77  23  51  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are distributed among the agents. We can try to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences. Below are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [31, 25, 98, 35, 70, 40, 66, 73, 87]
- Agent 1: [82, 8, 12, 90, 87, 53, 48, 28, 56]
- Agent 2: [65, 5, 14, 3, 86, 0, 2, 0, 74]
- Agent 3: [55, 93, 66, 37, 91, 77, 23, 51, 85]

We will allocate items based on maximizing the value for each agent:

1. Agent 3 highly values item 1 (93), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
2. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (98), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (82), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 2 highly values item 4 (86), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
5. Agent 3 also values item 5 (77) highly, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
6. Agent 0 values item 8 (87) highly, so we allocate item 8 to Agent 0.
7. Agent 1 values item 3 (90) highly, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
8. Agent 2 values item 8 (74) highly, but it's already allocated. Instead, item 6 (2) isn't preferred by others, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
9. Agent 3 values item 7 (51) more than others, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Now, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: [2, 8]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [4, 6]
- Agent 3: [1, 5, 7]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1, 5, 7]
}
```
