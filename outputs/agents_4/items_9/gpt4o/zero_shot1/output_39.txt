Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  28  77  52  68  35  47  24  89
1  65   6   6  99  68   4  13  49  79
2  68  43  77  61  46  44  26  48  63
3  68  58  56  37  89  91  92  12  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65  6  6 99 68  4 13 49 79]

 [68 58 56 37 89 91 92 12 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets, while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the table:

```
Agent 0: [98, 28, 77, 52, 68, 35, 47, 24, 89]
Agent 1: [65,  6,  6, 99, 68,  4, 13, 49, 79]
Agent 2: [68, 43, 77, 61, 46, 44, 26, 48, 63]
Agent 3: [68, 58, 56, 37, 89, 91, 92, 12, 94]
```

Let's allocate the items to the agents:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (98) and item 8 (89).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (99) and has a decent valuation for item 8 (79).
3. **Agent 2** has decent valuations for items 2 (77) and item 3 (61).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (91), item 6 (92), and item 8 (94).

To ensure fairness, we can aim for a balanced allocation where each agent receives approximately 2-3 items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 8. (High valuation)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 3 and 4. (High valuation on item 3 and decent on item 4)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 2 and 7.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 5, 6, and 1. (High valuation on items 5 and 6)

Following this allocation strategy ensures each agent gets a good value from their allocated items while every item is assigned.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [5, 6, 1]
}
```
