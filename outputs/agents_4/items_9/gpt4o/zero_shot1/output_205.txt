Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  44  16  54  77  65  79  18  50
1  53  29  65  12  46  69  54  56  74
2   6  49  11  92  35  40  26  95  23
3  76  51   7  33  56   4  33  17  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple approach to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. A common method is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets roughly the same number of items (in this case, approximately 2 items each since there are 9 items and 4 agents).

Here's the valuation matrix for clarity:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  44  16  54  77  65  79  18  50
1  53  29  65  12  46  69  54  56  74
2   6  49  11  92  35  40  26  95  23
3  76  51   7  33  56   4  33  17  62
```

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Sort each item by the highest valuation and assign it to the respective agent if they haven't reached their fair share of items (approximately 2).

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it highest (76) → Assign to Agent 3
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it highest (44) → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest (65) → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it highest (92) → Assign to Agent 2
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it highest (77) → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it highest (69) → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it highest (79) → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it highest (95) → Assign to Agent 2
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it highest (74) → Assign to Agent 1

Now, we check if each agent has approximately 2 items:

- Agent 0: [1, 4, 6] (3 items)
- Agent 1: [2, 5, 8] (3 items)
- Agent 2: [3, 7] (2 items)
- Agent 3: [0] (1 item)

To ensure fairness, let's redistribute a bit:

- Move item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 has only 1 item.

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [2, 5, 8]
- Agent 2: [3, 7]
- Agent 3: [0, 6]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 8],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
