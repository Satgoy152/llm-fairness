Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2   7  31  24  33  64  25  86  19
1  52  64  45  42  42   4  29   2  60
2   6  44  37  64  99  12  11  99   5
3  37  75  39  49  36   1  51   5  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, given that there are 4 agents and 9 items. We can use a simple heuristic approach to allocate items based on the highest valuations provided by each agent, ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Start by giving each agent their highest valued item, ensuring every agent gets at least one item.
2. **Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items based on which agent values them the most, ensuring no agent receives more items than necessary.

**Step 1: Initial Allocation**

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (86).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (64).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (99).
- Agent 3 values item 8 the most (95).

**Step 2: Allocate Remaining Items**

- Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 52).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 31).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 64).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 64).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value 51).

**Final Allocation:**

Agent 0: [2, 5, 7]
Agent 1: [0, 1]
Agent 2: [3, 4]
Agent 3: [6, 8]

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6, 8]
}
```
