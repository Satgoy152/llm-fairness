Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  91  88  49  58  54  24  80  34
1  33  19  31  21   9  37   4  84  73
2  83  11  21  62  24  66  47  73  28
3  22  93  30  96  28  73  40  53  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider a strategy that tries to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share of the items. Since there are 4 agents and 9 items, one possible distribution would be to give 2 agents 2 items each and 2 agents 3 items each.

Let's begin by examining the valuation table:

```
Agent 0: [52, 91, 88, 49, 58, 54, 24, 80, 34]
Agent 1: [33, 19, 31, 21, 9, 37, 4, 84, 73]
Agent 2: [83, 11, 21, 62, 24, 66, 47, 73, 28]
Agent 3: [22, 93, 30, 96, 28, 73, 40, 53, 99]
```

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: Has high values for items 1 and 2. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 7 highly. Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 and 8 highly. Assign these items to Agent 3.

Now, we have:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [7]
- Agent 2: Item [0]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 8]

There are 3 items left to be allocated: 4, 5, and 6.

5. **Agent 1**: Assign item 6 (next highest value for Agent 1).
6. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (next highest value for Agent 2).
7. **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 (next highest available value for Agent 0).

### Final Allocations
Now, we have a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [7, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 8]

This strategy tries to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated fairly.

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3, 8]
}
```
