Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  51  35  64  10  11  47  18  76
1  65  32  27   9   1  47  65  39  65
2  30  52  71  46  49  83  93  41  50
3  52  12  69  14  45  71  42   4  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuation table and try to distribute the items so that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. Given there are 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will inevitably receive fewer items than the others. 

Let's go through the table to find an optimal allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 8 (76), Item 3 (64), Item 0 (56).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (65), Item 6 (65), Item 8 (65).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (93), Item 5 (83), Item 2 (71).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (71), Item 2 (69), Item 0 (52).

Given these observations, let's allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring no item is given to more than one agent:

- Assign Item 8 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. Let's continue allocating the remaining items considering the next highest valuations:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, 8 items are allocated. We need to allocate one last item:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [8, 3, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [6, 2]
- Agent 3: Items [5, 4]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3, 1],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```
