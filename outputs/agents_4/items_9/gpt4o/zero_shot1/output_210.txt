Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  77  54  12  36  89  16   8  32
1  67  92  56  36  84  34   1  60  22
2  53  36   4  33   5  41  53  32  71
3  57  27  46  32   2  83  75  48  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 77 54 12 36 89 16  8 32]
 [67 92 56 36 84 34  1 60 22]

 [57 27 46 32  2 83 75 48 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 4 agents, we can try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 9, and each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Item 5 (value 89)
  - Item 0 (value 37)

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Item 1 (value 92)
  - Item 4 (value 84)

- **Agent 2:** 
  - Item 8 (value 71)
  - Item 7 (value 32)

- **Agent 3:** 
  - Item 6 (value 75)
  - Item 3 (value 32)
  - Item 2 (value 46)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [8, 7],
    "3": [6, 3, 2]
}
```
