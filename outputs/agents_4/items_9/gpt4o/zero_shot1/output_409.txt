Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  86  14  96  62  98  90  42  73
1  13  69  49  59  24  82  37  40  74
2  45  57  76  65  93   2  50  92  21
3  37  82  40  34  14  94  10  60   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that every agent gets an integer number of items. We aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most at 98, so we allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 8 the most at 74, so we allocate item 8 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 93, so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most at 94, but item 5 is already taken. The next highest value is item 1 at 82, so we allocate item 1 to agent 3.

Now let's allocate the remaining items:

5. Agent 0's next highest valuation is item 3 at 96, so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.
6. Agent 1's next highest valuation is item 5 at 82, but item 5 is already taken. The next highest value is item 3 at 59, but it's taken. Then item 1 at 69, but it's taken. So, we allocate item 7 to agent 1 since it has the highest remaining value of 40 for agent 1.
7. Agent 2's next highest valuation is item 7 at 92, but item 7 is taken. So, we allocate item 2 to agent 2 since it has the highest remaining value of 76 for agent 2.
8. Agent 3's next highest valuation is item 0 at 37, so we allocate item 0 to agent 3.
9. Finally, item 6 is left, and agent 0 has the highest valuation for it at 90, so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 6],
    "1": [8, 7],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```
