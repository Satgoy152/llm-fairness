Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  87  47  19  33  29  87   8  45
1  90  80  39   4  10  66  31  88  25
2  92  64  66  32  39  53  47  27  75
3  99   8  82  63  74  93  18  39  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0: This agent values items 0, 1, and 6 equally and highly. Therefore, we can give these items to Agent 0 to maximize their satisfaction.

2. Agent 1: This agent has high value for item 7. We can allocate this item to Agent 1.

3. Agent 2: This agent values item 8 highly. We can allocate item 8 to Agent 2.

4. Agent 3: This agent values item 3 the highest. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 2, 4, and 5. We will allocate them based on the next highest values each agent has for these items:

- Item 2: Agent 3 has the highest value for item 2 among the remaining unallocated items.
- Item 4: Agent 3 also has the highest value for item 4.
- Item 5: Agent 3 has the highest value for item 5.

Hereâ€™s the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, while trying to fairly distribute the values based on the agents' preferences.
