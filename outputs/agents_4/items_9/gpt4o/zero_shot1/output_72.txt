Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  92  36   6  99  17  15  69  92
1  24   9  22  76  31  53  55  88   3
2  12  28  53   3  52   0  44  92  47
3  48  43  93  91  97  53  90  55  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately an equal share of value based on their respective valuations. Given that there are 9 items and 4 agents, one potential approach is to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 4 (99), 1 (92), 8 (92), 2 (36)
   - Allocate items: 4 and 1 (total value: 191)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 7 (88), 3 (76), 5 (53)
   - Allocate items: 7 and 3 (total value: 164)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 7 (92), 2 (53), 4 (52)
   - Allocate items: 2 and 8 (total value: 100)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 2 (93), 4 (97), 3 (91), 6 (90)
   - Allocate items: 0, 5, and 6 (total value: 191)

Now, let's ensure that each item is allocated to one agent only. The allocation should be:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 1
- Agent 1: Items 7, 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 8
- Agent 3: Items 0, 5, 6

All 9 items are allocated, and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [0, 5, 6]
}
```
