Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  45  53  25  45  28  82  55  58
1  29  48  54   0  62  90   4  35  21
2  73  48  96  60  79  79  29  88  32
3   1  20  50   5  63  75  84  91  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider the valuations provided and try to ensure each agent gets a reasonable share of high-value items according to their preferences. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 3 items while the others will receive 2 items each.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items: 0 (96), 6 (82)
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items: 5 (90), 4 (62)
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items: 2 (96), 7 (88)
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items: 8 (95), 7 (91)

Now, let's allocate:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 6 (since those are the highest-valued items for them).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 5 and 4 (since those are the highest-valued items for them).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 2 and 7 (since those are the highest-valued items for them).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items 8 and 3. 

Now, we have allocated 8 items. We need to allocate one more item to one of the agents. Let's look for the next highest value:

- For Agent 0, the next highest is item 1 (45).
- For Agent 1, the next highest is item 1 (48).
- For Agent 2, the next highest is item 4 (79).
- For Agent 3, the next highest is item 6 (84).

Let's allocate an additional item to Agent 3 because their next highest item (6) has the highest value among the remaining items.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [8, 3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items in a way that reflects their preferences as much as possible while distributing the items fairly.
