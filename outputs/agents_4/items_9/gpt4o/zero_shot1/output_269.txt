Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  52  61   3  18  33  96  66  21
1  14  41  35  45  10  86  47   1  46
2  90  15  78  20   1  39  83   5  94
3  30  44   6  25  69  87  33  17  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, one possible way to distribute them is to give some agents 2 items and some 3 items, as 2+2+2+3 = 9.

Given the valuations, a potential strategy could be to maximize the total value for each agent by assigning items based on their highest valuations, while ensuring everyone receives items in a balanced manner.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 5, 8
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4, 7
- Agent 3: Item 1

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [3, 4, 7],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items, considering both the total number of items and the agents' valuations.
