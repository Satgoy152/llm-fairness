Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20   0  43  48  19  79  92  14  82
1  61  36  97  51  61  40  55  95  14
2  50  31  21  15  68   1  34  13  85
3  70  52  88  17  27  70  64  98  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, the simplest approach is to ensure each agent gets at least 2 items, with one agent getting 3 items.

Let's distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets approximately their fair share. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations for Agent 0 are items 6, 5, and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations for Agent 1 are items 2, 7, and 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations for Agent 2 are items 8, 4, and 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations for Agent 3 are items 7, 2, and 0.

We need to ensure no item is allocated more than once and each agent gets a fair share. We can try the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [5, 6] (highest and second highest for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [2, 7] (highest and second highest for Agent 1).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items [4, 8] (second and third highest for Agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items [0, 1, 3] (highest and others available for Agent 3).

Now, let's ensure that each item is only allocated once and verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [5, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 7]
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 8]
- **Agent 3**: Items [0, 1, 3]

All items are allocated, and each agent receives between 2 and 3 items. Here is the allocation presented in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
