Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2   7  64  38  13  85  93  81  22
1  60  64   0  33   2   4  48  47  52
2  15  77   0  19  57  78  69  74  20
3  61  22  37  55  99  58  98  79  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items such that each agent's satisfaction is reasonably balanced. One approach is to allocate the items based on each agent's highest valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item when possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 5, 6, and 7. However, since we need to distribute fairly, we will allocate:
   - Item 6 (value 93) to Agent 0
   - Item 5 (value 85) to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1:
   - Item 1 (value 64) to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1, 5, and 7 but item 1 is already taken:
   - Item 7 (value 74) to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for item 4:
   - Item 4 (value 99) to Agent 3

At this point, each agent has received at least one high-value item, and we need to distribute the remaining items fairly:

5. Allocate remaining items:
   - Item 0 (value 2 for Agent 0, 60 for Agent 1, 15 for Agent 2, 61 for Agent 3). Highest value is for Agent 3.
     - Item 0 to Agent 3
   - Item 2 (value 64 for Agent 0, 0 for Agent 1, 0 for Agent 2, 37 for Agent 3). Highest value is for Agent 0.
     - Item 2 to Agent 0
   - Item 3 (value 38 for Agent 0, 33 for Agent 1, 19 for Agent 2, 55 for Agent 3). Highest value is for Agent 3.
     - Item 3 to Agent 3
   - Item 8 (value 22 for Agent 0, 52 for Agent 1, 20 for Agent 2, 39 for Agent 3). Highest value is for Agent 1.
     - Item 8 to Agent 1

Now, each agent has received a fair allocation of items with their most valued items considered.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
