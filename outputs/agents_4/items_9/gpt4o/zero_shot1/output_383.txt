Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  64   9  65  54   0  62  10  19
1  20  33   5   2  52  68  70  69  58
2  91  54  89  80  82  26  83  58  59
3  83  89  80  68  26  52  64  25  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Maximizing Total Value:** Allocate items in such a way that each agent receives items they value highly. This will involve comparing the values across agents for each item.

2. **Ensuring Fair Distribution:** As there are 9 items and 4 agents, one possible strategy is to allocate 2 items to three agents and 3 items to one agent, or distribute them in a way that balances the total value received by each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Highest values: Item 0 (82), Item 1 (64)
  - Allocate Items: [0, 1]

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest values: Item 6 (70), Item 7 (69)
  - Allocate Items: [6, 7]

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest values: Item 2 (89), Item 3 (80), Item 4 (82)
  - Allocate Items: [2, 4]

- **Agent 3:**
  - Remaining items: Item 5 (52), Item 8 (33)
  - Allocate Items: [3, 5, 8] (Note: Item 8 has the highest remaining value for Agent 3)

Now, each agent has received items in a way that aims to maximize their individual values while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3, 5, 8]
}
```
