Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  31  40   3  58  27  75  22  91
1  96  15  57  86  25  31  70  80  95
2  14  22   6  88  30  45  39  38  16
3  56  34  33  58  33  45   2  21  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations of the items by each agent and attempt to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes overall satisfaction.

One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no two agents receive the same item. This method doesn't guarantee a perfectly fair distribution in terms of number of items per agent but aims to maximize the total value received by all agents.

Let's assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (96)
2. Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (31)
3. Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (57)
4. Item 3: Highest value by Agent 2 (88)
5. Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (58)
6. Item 5: Highest value by Agent 2 (45)
7. Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (75)
8. Item 7: Highest value by Agent 1 (80)
9. Item 8: Highest value by Agent 0 (91)

Now, letâ€™s ensure each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is as fair as possible, considering the number of items and the total valuation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 4, 6, 8
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, 7
- Agent 2 receives items 3, 5
- Agent 3 does not receive any items because their highest valuation does not surpass others for any item.

Revisiting the allocation to ensure each agent has at least one item and reallocating for fairness may look like:

- Adjust item distribution to give each agent at least one item

Let's make the distribution fairer:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 6, 8
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 7
- Agent 2: Item 3, 5
- Agent 3: Item 1

Finally, we can present the allocations as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```
