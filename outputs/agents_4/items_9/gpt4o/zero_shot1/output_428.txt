Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  48  50  67  63  16  18   1  90
1  76  33  59  18  73  17  87   4  63
2  45  19  77  52   1  49  29  48  81
3  37  90  71  69  56  92  87  80  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, then adjust to ensure all agents get items if possible. Let's proceed with this approach.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 76, so assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most at 90, so assign to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 77, so assign to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 67, so assign to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 73, so assign to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most at 92, so assign to Agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 87, so assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most at 80, so assign to Agent 3.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 3 values it the most at 99, so assign to Agent 3.

### Check and Adjustment:

- Agent 0 has 1 item.
- Agent 1 has 3 items.
- Agent 2 has 1 item.
- Agent 3 has 4 items.

All items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item. The allocation seems fair based on maximizing value for each agent.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items according to the values they place on them.
