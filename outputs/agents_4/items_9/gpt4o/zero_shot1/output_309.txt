Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  79  49  58  93  78  82  31  34
1  89  61  79   2  35  75   3  70  35
2  17  61  38  73  21  45  84  29  53
3  32  63  49  60  70   3  59  81  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by considering their valuations for each item. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. List all items in descending order based on their highest valuation by any agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while maintaining a balance in the number of items each agent receives.

Let's begin:

1. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 93.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 79.
3. Item 8: Agent 3 values it at 91.
4. Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 84.
5. Item 7: Agent 3 values it at 81.
6. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 89.
7. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 78.
8. Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 73.
9. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 79.

Now, let's ensure that the allocation is balanced by redistributing if necessary:

- Agent 0 has items [1, 4, 5].
- Agent 1 has items [0, 2].
- Agent 2 has items [3, 6].
- Agent 3 has items [7, 8].

This ensures that each agent receives at least two items, and the allocations are as balanced as practically possible given the constraints.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [7, 8]
}
```
