Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  17  46  83  38   9  41  80  34
1  72   6  69  13  61  34  15  87  74
2  60  97  86  47  20  69  11  87  87
3  35  21  77  32  10  50  89  13  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. 

Let's summarize the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 80 + 17 + 46 + 83 + 38 + 9 + 41 + 80 + 34 = 428
- Agent 1: 72 + 6 + 69 + 13 + 61 + 34 + 15 + 87 + 74 = 431
- Agent 2: 60 + 97 + 86 + 47 + 20 + 69 + 11 + 87 + 87 = 564
- Agent 3: 35 + 21 + 77 + 32 + 10 + 50 + 89 + 13 + 92 = 419

Next, let's consider a strategy to allocate based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction by distributing items where they have the highest relative valuation. This approach helps ensure that each agent feels they are getting a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for item 1).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for item 3).
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for item 5).
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for item 6).
5. Assign item 8 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for item 8).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation for item 0).
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (second highest valuation for item 2).
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 4).
9. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 7).

The selected allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
