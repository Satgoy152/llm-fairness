Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  18  26   3  60  23  60  73  15
1  97  26  88  41   3  76  44  40  65
2  30  47  92   5  36  16  69  60  42
3  82  21  14  88  78  51  72  42   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Given that there are 4 agents and 9 items, one agent will need to receive 3 items, and the other three agents will each receive 2 items.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction for each agent:

1. Consider the highest valuations for each agent and try to allocate those items to them.

2. Make sure each agent receives at least two items, and one agent receives three items.

3. Try to balance the allocation so that no agent feels significantly less satisfied than the others.

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 and 6. We can allocate these two items to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 2. We can allocate these two items to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 7. However, since item 2 is already allocated to agent 1, we can allocate items 7 and 8 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3 and 4. Again, since item 4 is already allocated to agent 0, we can allocate items 3 and 5 to agent 3.
- We still have items 1, 2, and 7 left to allocate. Since agent 2 currently has only one item, we can give them item 1 as well.

Now, let's review the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 7, 8]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 5]

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 7, 8],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
