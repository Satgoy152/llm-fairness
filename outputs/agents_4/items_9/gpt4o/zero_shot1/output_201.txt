Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  87  87  49  35  28  63  18  28
1  75  29  71  23  83   2  84   8  47
2   6  17  96  11  44  85  15  75  15
3  66  51  50  20  51  45  27  77  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 87 87 49 35 28 63 18 28]
 [75 29 71 23 83  2 84  8 47]
 [ 6 17 96 11 44 85 15 75 15]
 [66 51 50 20 51 45 27 77 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

The valuations are:
- Agent 0: [71, 87, 87, 49, 35, 28, 63, 18, 28]
- Agent 1: [75, 29, 71, 23, 83, 2, 84, 8, 47]
- Agent 2: [6, 17, 96, 11, 44, 85, 15, 75, 15]
- Agent 3: [66, 51, 50, 20, 51, 45, 27, 77, 74]

We can attempt to allocate items to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their highest valuations first:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are items 1 and 2. Let's allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are items 4 and 6. Let's allocate items 4 and 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are items 2 and 5. But item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0. So, allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are items 7 and 8. Let's allocate items 7 and 8 to Agent 3.

Now, let's check which items are remaining and allocate them:
- Remaining items are 0 and 3.

Allocating remaining items based on the next highest valuations:
- **Agent 0**: Item 0
- **Agent 3**: Item 3

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [5]
- Agent 3: Items [7, 8, 3]

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7, 8, 3]
}
```
