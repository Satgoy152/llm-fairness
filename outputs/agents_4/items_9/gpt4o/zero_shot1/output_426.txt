Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  47  81  41  53  64  35  76  88
1  57   1  65  31  49  75  58  73   5
2  25  66  24  22  67  43  12  61  65
3  86  80  58  48  82  22  64  38  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57  1 65 31 49 75 58 73  5]

 [86 80 58 48 82 22 64 38 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's consider maximizing the total value each agent derives from their allocated items. We will aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets a reasonable share of high-value items according to their preferences.

Here is a suggested allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items where agent 0 has high valuations.
   - Items: 0 (40), 1 (47), 3 (41)

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items where agent 1 has high valuations.
   - Items: 5 (75), 6 (58)

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items where agent 2 has high valuations.
   - Items: 4 (67), 8 (65)

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items where agent 3 has high valuations.
   - Items: 2 (58), 7 (38)

This allocation ensures that each agent has a fair share of the items according to their valuations. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```
