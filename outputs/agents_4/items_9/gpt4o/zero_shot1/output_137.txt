Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  89  21  91  76  31  16  73  49
1  43  79  44  41  38  20  39  42  43
2  14  55  41  37   4  55  95  98  37
3  33  39  61  70  98  13  90  73  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Given there are 4 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive 3 items, and the others will receive 2 items each.

Let's look at the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: 0, 89, 21, 91, 76, 31, 16, 73, 49
Agent 1: 43, 79, 44, 41, 38, 20, 39, 42, 43
Agent 2: 14, 55, 41, 37, 4, 55, 95, 98, 37
Agent 3: 33, 39, 61, 70, 98, 13, 90, 73, 83
```

One approach is to assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent, taking care to ensure a balanced allocation of items. Let's proceed with this method:

1. Agent 0 has high value for items 3 (91) and 1 (89).
2. Agent 1 has high value for items 1 (79) and 2 (44).
3. Agent 2 has high value for items 6 (95) and 7 (98).
4. Agent 3 has high value for items 4 (98) and 8 (83).

Now let's assign items, ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

- Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 0 (since they have the highest valuation for these).
- Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 1 (to balance allocations and Agent 1 values item 2 highly).
- Assign items 6 and 7 to Agent 2 (since they have the highest valuation for these).
- Assign items 4 and 8 to Agent 3 (since they value these highly).

Now, we have assigned 8 items. We need to assign the remaining item 5. Considering the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 5 at 31.
- Agent 1 values item 5 at 20.
- Agent 2 values item 5 at 55.
- Agent 3 values item 5 at 13.

We'll assign item 5 to Agent 2 since they have the highest valuation for it, and they are supposed to get 3 items.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5, 6, 7],
    "3": [4, 8]
}
```
