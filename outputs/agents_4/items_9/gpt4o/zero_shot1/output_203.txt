Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  64  89  69  98  78  83   5  48
1  28  70  37   6  25  44  29  96   0
2  41  55  82  44   2   4  52  48  72
3  16  11  64  65  18  81  82  49  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value of the items. One common approach is to use a method similar to the "envy-free" allocation, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent:** 
   Sum the values each agent assigns to all items.

2. **Determine Fair Share for Each Agent:**
   Divide each agent's total value by the number of agents to determine the fair share.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent's total allocated value does not exceed their fair share significantly.

Let's compute the values and allocations:

### Agent Value Calculations

- **Agent 0 Total Value:** 89 + 64 + 89 + 69 + 98 + 78 + 83 + 5 + 48 = 623
- **Agent 1 Total Value:** 28 + 70 + 37 + 6 + 25 + 44 + 29 + 96 + 0 = 335
- **Agent 2 Total Value:** 41 + 55 + 82 + 44 + 2 + 4 + 52 + 48 + 72 = 400
- **Agent 3 Total Value:** 16 + 11 + 64 + 65 + 18 + 81 + 82 + 49 + 85 = 471

### Allocations

We will allocate items with the goal of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while also ensuring a fair distribution of the total value.

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it most at 89.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it most at 64.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it most at 89.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 3 values it most at 65.
   - Allocate to Agent 3.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it most at 98.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 3 values it most at 81.
   - Allocate to Agent 3.

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 3 values it most at 82.
   - Allocate to Agent 3.

8. **Item 7:**
   - Agent 1 values it most at 96.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

9. **Item 8:**
   - Agent 3 values it most at 85.
   - Allocate to Agent 3.

### Resulting Allocation

Based on the above step-by-step allocation, here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it most, and each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their valuations.
