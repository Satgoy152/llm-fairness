Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  39  63   4  22  73  76   4  87
1  56  40  20  42  65   7  70  87  45
2  76  76  23  93  90  85  23  48  33
3  36  59   2   7  48  96  35  45  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the situation and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: Item 8 (87), Item 6 (76), Item 5 (73)
   - Allocate items: 8, 6, 5

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: Item 7 (87), Item 6 (70), Item 4 (65)
   - Allocate items: 7, 4

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: Item 3 (93), Item 4 (90), Item 5 (85)
   - Allocate items: 3, 0

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: Item 5 (96), Item 8 (89), Item 1 (59)
   - Allocate items: 1, 2

Revisit allocations to ensure all items are uniquely and fairly allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 8, 6, 5
- Agent 1: Items 7, 4
- Agent 2: Items 3, 0
- Agent 3: Items 1, 2

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 9 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Items 4, 7
- Agent 2: Items 3, 6
- Agent 3: Items 1, 2, 8

Now, present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 2, 8]
}
```
