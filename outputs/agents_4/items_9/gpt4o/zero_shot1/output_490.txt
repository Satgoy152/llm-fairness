Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  19  59  84  40  97  29  84  38
1  74  66  99   3  89  10  20  25  35
2  89  57  33  35  62  58  36  54  84
3  99  30  95  60  77  14  99  65  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 5 (Value: 97)
   - Item 3 (Value: 84)
   - Item 2 (Value: 59)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2 (Value: 99)
   - Item 4 (Value: 89)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 8 (Value: 84)
   - Item 0 (Value: 89)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 6 (Value: 99)
   - Item 1 (Value: 30)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [8, 0],
    "3": [6, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a set of items that maximize their total valuation based on the constraints that each agent must get an integer number of items and all 9 items must be allocated.
