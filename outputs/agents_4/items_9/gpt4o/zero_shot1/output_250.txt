Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  63  32  71  23  84  98  93  55
1  99  89  34  89  46  11  46  54  17
2   1  72  82  84  80  67  41  64  11
3  23  85  22  90  99  70  50  10   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We can use a greedy approach by assigning items to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item by the end of the allocation process.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of how many items each agent has.
2. **Adjustment:** If any agent ends up with no items, reallocate items from agents with more than one item to ensure all agents have items, while trying to minimize the reduction in the overall valuation.
3. **Finalization:** Ensure that exactly 9 items are allocated in total.

Starting with the initial allocation:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 1 (99).
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 3 (85).
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 2 (82).
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 3 (90).
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 3 (99).
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 0 (84).
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 0 (98).
- Item 7 is valued highest by agent 0 (93).
- Item 8 is valued highest by agent 0 (55).

After this greedy allocation, we have:
- Agent 0: Items [5, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 3, 4]

Now, let's adjust to ensure each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0 has 4 items: [5, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1 has 1 item: [0]
- Agent 2 has 1 item: [2]
- Agent 3 has 3 items: [1, 3, 4]

To balance:
- Transfer item 8 from agent 0 to agent 2 (Agent 2 now has items [2, 8])
- This results in:

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and only 9 items are allocated in total.
