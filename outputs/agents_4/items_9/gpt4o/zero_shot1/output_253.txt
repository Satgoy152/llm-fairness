Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  78  28   0  98  16  35  15  99
1  84  48  43  46  20  12  45  35  59
2  39  31  83   3  64   2   1  77  92
3  72  42  21  38  71  15   8  34  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by distributing the items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 4 (98) and item 8 (99). Let's allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 0 (84). We can allocate this item to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 2 (83) and item 7 (77). We will allocate these items to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 3 (38), item 1 (42), and item 6 (8). We will allocate these items to Agent 3.

By following this allocation, we have assigned all 9 items fairly based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 gets items 4 and 8.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 7.
- Agent 3 gets items 1, 3, and 6.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [1, 3, 6]
}
```
