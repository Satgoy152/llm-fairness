Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25   5  64  45  36  98  66   5   9
1  15   7  50  95  92  70  95  62   4
2  72  85  49  39  48  21  58  93  32
3  62  86  50  82  27  44  78   8  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to start by assigning each agent the item they value the most and then proceed to allocate the remaining items considering the next highest values and avoiding conflicts.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value is for item 5 (value 98).
   - Assign item 5 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value is for item 3 (value 95).
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value is for item 1 (value 85).
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value is for item 1 (value 86), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 3 (value 82), but it's also taken. Then item 6 (value 78).
   - Assign item 6 to agent 3.

Now that each agent has at least one item, we continue assigning the remaining items while considering the highest values:

5. **Remaining items: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8**

6. **Agent 0:**
   - Next highest value is for item 2 (value 64).
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0.

7. **Agent 1:**
   - Next highest value is for item 6 (value 95), but it's already taken. Next is item 4 (value 92).
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1.

8. **Agent 2:**
   - Next highest value is for item 7 (value 93).
   - Assign item 7 to agent 2.

9. **Agent 3:**
   - Remaining highest value item is 0 (value 62).
   - Assign item 0 to agent 3.

Finally, item 8 is left:

10. **Agent 1:**
    - Assign remaining item 8 to agent 1 since it has the highest remaining value for agent 1 (value 4).

The final allocations will be:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 8],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [6, 0]
}
```
