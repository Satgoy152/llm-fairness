Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  98  94  97  85  58  90   3  27
1  48  26  84  46  48  56  84  75   0
2  67  99  42  50   9  88  36  22  52
3  43  28  49  64  37  33  80  80  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [48 26 84 46 48 56 84 75  0]

 [43 28 49 64 37 33 80 80 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in a manner that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated. Let's evaluate the valuations and try to allocate the items to maximize fairness and satisfaction for each agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [24, 98, 94, 97, 85, 58, 90, 3, 27]
- Agent 1: [48, 26, 84, 46, 48, 56, 84, 75, 0]
- Agent 2: [67, 99, 42, 50, 9, 88, 36, 22, 52]
- Agent 3: [43, 28, 49, 64, 37, 33, 80, 80, 99]

We will aim to allocate the items so each agent receives an optimal selection based on their valuations.

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 2, 3, and 6. We will allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values items 2, 6, and 7 highly. We will allocate items 6 and 7 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values items 1 and 5 highly. We will allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 8 the most. We will allocate item 8 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items. We'll evaluate the remaining available items and agents' needs:

- Items left: 0, 3, 4
- Agent 0 can take item 3.
- Agent 2 can take item 0.
- Agent 3 can take item 4.

By following this allocation strategy, we ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4, 8]
}
```
