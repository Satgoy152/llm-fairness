Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  73  33  14  34  98  80  34  62
1  69  53  79  14  81  82  51  29  40
2   4  20  20  65  41   8  38  60  16
3   1  51  29  30  61  59  32  47  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all items are allocated. One approach is to try to maximize the total value for each agent, considering their preferences.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (98), 6 (80), 1 (73)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 4 (81), 5 (82), 2 (79)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (65), 7 (60), 4 (41)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (61), 1 (51), 5 (59)

We'll attempt to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each item is allocated once.

### Allocation Strategy

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 5 and 6, as they have the highest values for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2 because it has a high value for Agent 1, and item 4 since item 5 is already taken.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3, which is the highest value for Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1, as item 4 is already taken.

We should now check if any items are unallocated. Items 0, 7, and 8 are still available. Let's assign these to balance the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 7
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 8

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their individual valuations where possible.
