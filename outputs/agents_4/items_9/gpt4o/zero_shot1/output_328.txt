Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  93  92  24  21   6  46  91   5
1  63  43  72  81  42  59  54  42  95
2  51  88  33  96  96  44  87  65  55
3  28  34  89  54   8  45  71  24  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately equal value, considering their valuations. Let's consider the process step by step:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to distribute items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

The total valuations for each agent are as follows:
- Agent 0: 387
- Agent 1: 551
- Agent 2: 615
- Agent 3: 413

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 1 (93), Item 2 (92), Item 7 (91): Total = 276

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 8 (95), Item 3 (81), Item 6 (54): Total = 230

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 4 (96), Item 5 (44): Total = 140

- **Agent 3**:
  - Item 0 (28): Total = 28

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [8, 3, 6],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all 9 items are allocated. Adjustments can be made to balance the perceived fairness further, but this distribution attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
