Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51   7  78  14  17  15  40  68  52
1  32   8  23  53  81  67  81  53   1
2  61  71  38  81  27   5  56  40  13
3  14  42  47  88  48  17  24  37  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items so that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexities of achieving envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations, we will attempt to distribute items such that each agent's bundle is as equally valued as possible according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2, 8, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4, 6, and 3.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 3, 1, and 0.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 3, 8, and 2.

We'll assign items by trying to fulfill the highest preferences while ensuring each agent gets a fair share relative to their valuations.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: We'll give items that have high value for Agent 0 without causing too much envy from others.
  - Items: [0, 8]

- **Agent 1**: High preference for items 4, 6.
  - Items: [4, 6]

- **Agent 2**: We'll give items that have high value for Agent 2.
  - Items: [1, 5]

- **Agent 3**: We'll give items that have high value for Agent 3.
  - Items: [2, 3, 7]

### Final Allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy each agent based on their highest-valued items, ensuring that each agent receives items they highly value while distributing all 9 items fairly.
