Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  47  99  90  80  24  54  67  35
1   0  86  73  29  43  15  83  90  86
2   0  58  77  34  22  39  43  78  16
3  70  95  31  42  10  40  15  53  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 86 73 29 43 15 83 90 86]
 [ 0 58 77 34 22 39 43 78 16]
 [70 95 31 42 10 40 15 53 69]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, depending on the constraints.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (99).
   - Next, agent 0 values item 0 at 97.
   - Agent 0 also values item 3 at 90.

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Agent 1 values item 7 at 90.
   - Next, agent 1 values item 1 at 86 and item 8 at 86 (tie).
   - However, to avoid conflicts and considering the next best item for other agents, agent 1 receives item 1 and item 8.

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Agent 2 values item 7 at 78, but it's already allocated. Agent 2’s next highest valuation is item 2 at 77, but it's already allocated.
   - Agent 2 then values item 6 at 43.
   - Agent 2 also values item 3 at 34 and item 1 at 58, but they are allocated, so item 4 at 22 is the next best unallocated item.

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Agent 3 values item 1 at 95 and item 3 at 42, but these are allocated.
   - Agent 3’s next highest valuations are item 0 at 70 and item 8 at 69, but item 8 is allocated, so item 5 at 40 is chosen.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 0, 3].
- Agent 1 gets items [7, 1, 8].
- Agent 2 gets items [6, 4].
- Agent 3 gets item [5].

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 3],
    "1": [7, 1, 8],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their individual valuations while attempting to minimize envy among the agents within the constraints provided.
