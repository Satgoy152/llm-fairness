Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  87  20  81  24  73  47  31  68
1  58  81  45  93  94  38  33  61  68
2  31   0  42  75  48  85  95  76  48
3  83  85  15  63  15  39  89  19  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to ensure an envy-free allocation as much as possible given the discrete nature of the items. We need to allocate all 9 items to the 4 agents such that their preferences are respected as much as possible.

One possible method to achieve this is by using the method of maximum marginal returns while considering the total valuation of items by each agent. We will proceed by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, but we'll also keep track of how many items each agent receives to maintain a balance.

Let's look at each item and allocate based on the highest valuation:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 3 (83).
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (87).
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 (45).
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 1 (93).
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 1 (94).
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 2 (85).
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 2 (95).
- Item 7 is valued highest by Agent 2 (76).
- Item 8 is valued highest by Agent 0 (68).

After this initial allocation, we need to ensure that no agent receives all the items and balance the distribution:

Initial allocation based on highest valuations:
- Agent 0: [1, 8]
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 2: [5, 6, 7]
- Agent 3: [0]

Let's review and make sure the agents have a fair distribution of items. Agent 3 only has one item, so let's consider redistributing items to ensure a more balanced allocation:

1. Move item 2 from Agent 1 to Agent 3 to increase the number of items for Agent 3.
2. Now Agent 1 has fewer items than desired; move item 8 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [3, 4, 8]
- Agent 2: [5, 6, 7]
- Agent 3: [0, 2]

This allocation ensures a more balanced distribution while respecting as many preferences as possible. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4, 8],
    "2": [5, 6, 7],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
