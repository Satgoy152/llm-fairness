Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  71   1  26   4   7  37  52   8
1  65  53  16  37  86  77  29  70  58
2  60  90  25  64  98  86  61  16  80
3  52   1  33  91  75  81   8  87  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or any other fair division algorithm. However, given the discrete nature of the problem (9 items and 4 agents), we'll approximate a fair solution by manually balancing the valuations as best as possible.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values highly item 0 (94).
- Agent 1 values highly item 4 (86).
- Agent 2 values highly item 4 (98).
- Agent 3 values highly item 3 (91).

We should try to allocate high-value items to the agents who value them the most, keeping in mind the goal of balancing total value fairly among the agents.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that Agent 0 values significantly more than others or has a high value for.
   - Items: 0, 1

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Item: 4, 8

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly.
   - Items: 5, 6

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that Agent 3 values highly.
   - Items: 3, 7, 2

This allocation attempts to balance the total values as fairly as possible given the constraints. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 7, 2]
}
```

This solution ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. The aim is to minimize envy by giving each agent items they value highly relative to the others.
