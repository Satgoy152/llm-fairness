Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  11  34  72  40  64  11  42  85
1  59   5  78  21  33  50  90  37  63
2  42  81  38   2  45  69  33  85  44
3  91   8  89  47  53  82  61  79  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to create an allocation where no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own based on their valuations. Given the constraints of integer allocations and the number of items, we need to ensure that each agent receives items such that the total number of allocated items is exactly 9.

We should consider the valuations table and find a distribution that seems to minimize envy. One approach is to use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or try to balance the values each agent receives.

Let's try a simple allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 3, and 8 highly, so we can assign them these items.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly, and we can also give them item 9.
- Agent 2 values item 1 and 7 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 2, 4, and 5 highly.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [6]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 4, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly, reducing potential envy. Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
