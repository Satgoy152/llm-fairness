Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  38  46  20  46   3  17  20  76
1  51  66  84  22  66  93  39  73   2
2  65  66  20  39  46  33   0  87  81
3  56  25  29  87   0  93   5  98  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for each item and attempt to distribute the items in a manner that approximates envy-freeness. Here, we intend to ensure each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations.

First, let's examine the total value each agent assigns to all items combined:

- Agent 0: \(25 + 38 + 46 + 20 + 46 + 3 + 17 + 20 + 76 = 291\)
- Agent 1: \(51 + 66 + 84 + 22 + 66 + 93 + 39 + 73 + 2 = 496\)
- Agent 2: \(65 + 66 + 20 + 39 + 46 + 33 + 0 + 87 + 81 = 437\)
- Agent 3: \(56 + 25 + 29 + 87 + 0 + 93 + 5 + 98 + 25 = 418\)

To achieve a fair distribution, we should aim for each agent to receive items that collectively have a high value for them, while considering the overall distribution of items.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Sort Items by Value for Each Agent:**
   - Identify which items each agent values the most and prioritize those for allocation to the respective agents.

2. **Greedy Allocation Based on Valuation:**
   - Start by assigning the highest valued items for each agent while ensuring no item is double-allocated.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Re-assess to ensure that the allocation does not leave any agent significantly disadvantaged.

### Allocations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: [8] (Value: 76)
  
  Agent 0 starts with item 8, which is their highest valued item.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: [5, 2] (Values: 93, 84)

  Agent 1 receives items 5 and 2, which are their top valued items.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Items: [7, 4] (Values: 87, 46)
  
  Agent 2 receives items 7 and 4, which contribute to their higher valuation.

- **Agent 3:**
  - Items: [3, 6, 0, 1] (Values: 87, 5, 56, 25)
  
  Agent 3 receives items 3, 6, 0, and 1, balancing their allocation with high-value items.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their highest valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.

{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [3, 6, 0, 1]
}
```
