Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  98   2  30  77  71  52  23  80
1  42  36   9  76  73  48  30   0  43
2  77  37  11  63  38  62   3   1  95
3  32  45  85  72   4   5   6  69  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning that no agent should prefer someone else's allocation over their own. Given these valuations, one common approach to achieve this is the "Envy-Free up to One Good" (EF1) criterion, where each agent should not envy another agent's bundle considering the removal of at most one item from the latter's bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to make a fair allocation:

### Step 1: Assign the highest valued items
- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (98), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (76), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 8 the most (95), so assign item 8 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (85), so assign item 2 to agent 3.

### Step 2: Assign remaining items to balance allocations
- Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 0 (49), assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for item 4 (73), assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 5 (62), assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has the next highest valuation for item 7 (69), assign item 7 to agent 3.

### Step 3: Assign the last remaining item
- The only remaining item is item 6. Looking at the valuations, agent 0 values item 6 at 52 and agent 1 values it at 30, agent 2 values it at 3, and agent 3 values it at 6. Assign item 6 to agent 0, who values it the most among the remaining options.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them their most valued items and ensuring the distribution is as fair as possible under the circumstances.

The final fair allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```
