Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  79  23  70  36  79  34  77  88
1  76  67  76  46  11   1  72  28  32
2  84  11  83  47  31  92  37   7  91
3  85  71  44  40   9  78   9  29  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items according to their valuation. One common approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is the use of an algorithm like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure, but given the integer constraints, we can try to manually assign items to balance valuations as closely as possible.

Consider the following steps for a fair allocation:

1. **List the total valuation for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: \(26 + 79 + 23 + 70 + 36 + 79 + 34 + 77 + 88 = 512\)
   - Agent 1: \(76 + 67 + 76 + 46 + 11 + 1 + 72 + 28 + 32 = 409\)
   - Agent 2: \(84 + 11 + 83 + 47 + 31 + 92 + 37 + 7 + 91 = 483\)
   - Agent 3: \(85 + 71 + 44 + 40 + 9 + 78 + 9 + 29 + 20 = 385\)

2. **Allocate the highest valued items to each agent first to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, while trying to balance the total valuation across agents:**

   - Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (value = 88), item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 76), item 5 to Agent 2 (value = 92), and item 0 to Agent 3 (value = 85).
   
3. **Continue allocating by considering the next highest values while maintaining balance:**

   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value = 79), item 6 to Agent 1 (value = 72), item 3 to Agent 2 (value = 47), and item 7 to Agent 3 (value = 29).

4. **Distribute remaining items while trying to balance the total valuation:**

   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value = 36) and item 9 to Agent 2 (value = 91).

5. **Final allocation:**

   - We must ensure all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item. The above assignments leave item 5 unallocated.

Here is one possible fair allocation that fulfills these requirements, with an attempt to balance each agent's total valuation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5, 3, 9],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value highly, attempting to maintain fairness and minimize envy.
