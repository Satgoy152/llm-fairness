Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  29  50  35  33  79  43  31  54
1  88  23  87  70  65  27  52  67  25
2  92  36  41  77  56  91  81  20  40
3  75  97  72  76  39  74  95  33  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a share that maximizes their valuation while trying to maintain envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

We'll approach this by considering each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute items such that the total value received by each agent is as high as possible given their preferences, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's start by examining the highest-valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 99.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 87.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 91.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 97.

Using these high-value preferences as a guide, let's attempt to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Starts with item 0 (value 99). Next, we consider other high-value items for Agent 0, such as item 5 (value 79).

2. **Agent 1**: Starts with item 2 (value 87). Next, consider item 3 (value 70) and item 4 (value 65).

3. **Agent 2**: Starts with item 5 (value 91). Next, consider item 6 (value 81).

4. **Agent 3**: Starts with item 1 (value 97). Next, consider item 7 (value 33) and item 8 (value 71).

After considering the high values for each agent, we can propose the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 8]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [5, 6]
- Agent 3: [1, 3, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while also keeping the total number of items allocated to each agent as close as possible to a fair share, considering the total number of items (9).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a set of items they value highly based on the provided valuations.
