Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  45   8  80  11  95  43  93  60
1  68  70  94  14  12  70  11  58  42
2  85  85   9  84   3   2  86  52  60
3  43   2  96  48  66  56  41  42  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation received by any other agent, based on their own valuations. Given the valuations, we will try to balance the perceived value across the agents.

Here is an approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Assign High-Value Items:** First, identify items that are significantly more valuable to specific agents compared to others and allocate them to those agents. This helps in ensuring that the allocations are perceived as fair.
2. **Balance the Remaining Items:** Distribute the remaining items to balance the total perceived value for each agent.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 3 (Value 80)
   - Item 6 (Value 43)
   - Total Value = 123

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2 (Value 94)
   - Item 4 (Value 12)
   - Total Value = 106

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0 (Value 85)
   - Item 8 (Value 60)
   - Total Value = 145

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 1 (Value 2)
   - Item 5 (Value 56)
   - Item 7 (Value 42)
   - Total Value = 100

This allocation attempts to evenly distribute the perceived total value of the items among the agents, minimizing envy.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint of distributing all 9 items among the 4 agents while aiming for a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
