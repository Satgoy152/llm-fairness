Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  73   7  48  99   6  96  52  61
1  31  37  55  94  96  27  60  34  82
2  45  50  22  85  25  78  11  37  84
3  13  47  91  35  14  58   4  16  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [13 47 91 35 14 58  4 16 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, meaning that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any allocation that another agent receives, based on their own valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuations and then proceed with an allocation strategy:

### Valuations Table:
```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
----------------------------------------------
    0      |  5  73   7  48  99   6  96  52  61
    1      | 31  37  55  94  96  27  60  34  82
    2      | 45  50  22  85  25  78  11  37  84
    3      | 13  47  91  35  14  58   4  16  79
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 highly: 99
   - Agent 1 values item 3 highly: 94
   - Agent 2 values item 5 highly: 78
   - Agent 3 values item 2 highly: 91

2. **Assign High-Value Items:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Consider the next highest valuations and try to distribute evenly:
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (value 96), and Item 1 (value 73).
   - Agent 1: Item 8 (value 82).
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (value 45), and Item 7 (value 37).
   - Agent 3: Item 9 (value 79).

4. **Ensure Allocation Completeness:**
   - All 9 items are allocated.
   - Each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 6],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance fairness by considering each agent's highest-valued items and distributing the items to maximize overall satisfaction across the agents.
