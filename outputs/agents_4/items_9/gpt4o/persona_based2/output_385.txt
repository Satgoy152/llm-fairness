Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  36  97  14  87  64  33  32  19
1  64  34  56  73  28  63  41  39  75
2  85  95  65  14  36  45  42  92  82
3   5  15  32   3  83  21  68  22  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method to balance the valuations each agent receives. A common approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where each agent takes turns selecting their most valued available item until all items are allocated. This method helps ensure fairness by allowing agents to pick according to their preferences, reducing the potential for envy.

Here's how the allocation could be:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (97), so they pick item 2.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the most (63) after item 2 is taken, so they pick item 5.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (95), so they pick item 1.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most (83), so they pick item 4.
5. **Agent 0**'s next highest value is item 0 (96), so they pick item 0.
6. **Agent 1**'s next highest value is item 8 (75), so they pick item 8.
7. **Agent 2**'s next highest value is item 7 (92), so they pick item 7.
8. **Agent 3**'s next highest value is item 6 (68), so they pick item 6.
9. **Agent 0**'s next highest value is item 3 (14), so they pick item 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, which helps in achieving a fair division and reducing envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 3],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
