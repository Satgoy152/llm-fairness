Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  34  80  18  94  45  85  16  36
1   7  70  50  65  49   0  79  45  38
2  29  10  34  71  42  27  19  91  25
3  21  99  34  97  46  37  87  70  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, one approach is to use the notion of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This can be done by assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes the minimum value across all agents.

Let's analyze the given valuations and attempt to allocate the items fairly:

### Valuations Matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  34  80  18  94  45  85  16  36
1   7  70  50  65  49   0  79  45  38
2  29  10  34  71  42  27  19  91  25
3  21  99  34  97  46  37  87  70  78
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Look for items that have high valuations for specific agents.
2. **Assign High-Value Items**: Allocate these items to the agents valuing them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
3. **Distribute Remaining Items**: After allocating high-value items, distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation across agents.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 4 highly (94). Assigning item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highly (70). Assigning item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 7 highly (91). Assigning item 7 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly (97). Assigning item 3 to Agent 3.

Remaining items: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8

- **Agent 3**: Also values item 1 highly (99), but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 8 (78). Assigning item 8 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 2**: Next highest after item 7 is item 3, assigned. Next is item 5 (27). Assigning item 5 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 1**: Next highest after item 1 is item 6 (79). Assigning item 6 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0**: Next highest after item 4 is item 2 (80). Assigning item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 6 highly (87), but assigned. Next is item 2, assigned. Assign item 0 (21).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [3, 8, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.
