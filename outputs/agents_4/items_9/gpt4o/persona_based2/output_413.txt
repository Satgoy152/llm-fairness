Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  16  34  14  22  12  61  35  35
1  37  29  61  58  62  55  56  37  88
2  45  59  33  60  11  19  99  58  42
3  26  62  44  36  12  77  97  16  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and create an allocation that respects each agent's preferences as much as possible. We'll use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for their allocated items while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations provided, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would have for every possible allocation.
2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Attempt to distribute items such that the difference in total valuation across agents is minimized.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (70), item 2 (34), and item 7 (35).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for item 4 (62), item 8 (88).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6 (99).
- Agent 3 has high valuations for item 1 (62), item 5 (77).

A possible fair allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 7] with a total valuation of 70 + 34 + 35 = 139.
- Agent 1: Items [4, 8] with a total valuation of 62 + 88 = 150.
- Agent 2: Item [6] with a valuation of 99.
- Agent 3: Items [1, 3, 5] with a total valuation of 62 + 36 + 77 = 175.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items to maximize their respective valuations while distributing all 9 items fairly among the agents.
