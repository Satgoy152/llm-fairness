Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  67   6  80  93  66   9  87  37
1  10  39  11  70  30  83  24  26  62
2  40  33  85  48  31  84  99  88   8
3  67  55  90  84  63   7  70  50   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we'll try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a round-robin or priority-based method, where agents choose items in turns based on their preferences.

Let's compute the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (93), allocate item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 5 (83), allocate item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 6 (99), allocate item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 2 (90), allocate item 2.

Now each agent has one item. Continue the allocation:

5. **Agent 0**: Next highest value is for item 3 (80), allocate item 3.
6. **Agent 1**: Next highest value is for item 8 (62), allocate item 8.
7. **Agent 2**: Next highest value is for item 7 (88), allocate item 7.
8. **Agent 3**: Next highest value is for item 0 (67), allocate item 0.

At this point, we've allocated eight items. There's one item left (item 1):

9. **Agent 0**: Highest remaining value for item 1 (67), allocate item 1.

This distribution attempts to balance the items based on the agents' preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 1],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a share of the items, attempting to respect their highest preferences as much as possible.
