Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  68  51   2  39  13  78  62  52
1  32  35  52  86  30  62  81   0  60
2  69  19  57  41  77  41  90  73  62
3  10   5  53   4  26  13  41  74   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent and try to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy. One common method to achieve this is using the "round-robin" approach, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that hasn't been allocated yet. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (84), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (86), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the most (90), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 the most (74), so we allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent has picked one item. We proceed to the next round:

5. **Agent 0** now values item 6 the most (78), but it's taken, so we go to the next highest: item 7 (62), but it's also taken. The next available highest valued item is item 1 (68). So we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** now values item 6 the most (81), but it's taken, so we go to the next highest: item 5 (62). We allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 2** now values item 7 the most (73), but it's taken, so we go to the next highest: item 4 (77). We allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
8. **Agent 3** now values item 7 the most (74), but it's taken, so we go to the next highest: item 2 (53). We allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

Finally, only one item remains:

9. **Agent 0** now values item 8 the most (52), and it is the only remaining item. We allocate item 8 to Agent 0.

After these allocations, each agent has received a fair share of items based on their valuation preferences without any envy. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly and each agent gets an integer number of items.
