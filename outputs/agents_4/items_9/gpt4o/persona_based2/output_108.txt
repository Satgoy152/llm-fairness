Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  35  11  44  13  94  30   0  10
1  40  98  48  60  41   7  23  27  43
2  74  86  14  86  27  50  90  42  67
3  26  41  62  54  52  43  26   9  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll use the "round-robin" method, one of the common approaches in fair division problems, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued available item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 1** picks item 1 (value 98).
2. **Agent 2** picks item 0 (value 74).
3. **Agent 0** picks item 5 (value 94).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 2 (value 62).

5. **Agent 1** picks item 3 (value 60).
6. **Agent 2** picks item 6 (value 90).
7. **Agent 0** picks item 4 (value 13).
8. **Agent 3** picks item 8 (value 38).

9. The remaining item, 7, is picked by **Agent 0** (value 0, but no other items left).

This allocation strives to give each agent the best possible items according to their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 8]
}
```
