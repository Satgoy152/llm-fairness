Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  58  82  43  80  79   4  32  62
1  52  48  85  62  93  84   1  60  66
2   5  56  59  22  57  76  63  95  25
3  85  24   5  77  10  21  22  60  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we'll aim to distribute items among the agents such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations provided, I'll use a method that considers each agent's highest valued items and attempts to assign items accordingly while ensuring each agent receives at least some high-valued items according to their preferences.

Let's look for an allocation:

1. Agent 0 values items 2 and 4 highly (82 and 80, respectively).
2. Agent 1 values items 4 and 5 highly (93 and 84, respectively).
3. Agent 2 values items 7 and 5 highly (95 and 76, respectively).
4. Agent 3 values items 0 and 8 highly (85 and 86, respectively).

We'll aim to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly while balancing overall satisfaction across all agents:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, their highest valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, their highest valued item.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2, their highest valued item.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3, their highest valued item.

Now, distribute remaining items while trying to maintain balance:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 5.
- Agent 2 receives item 6.
- Agent 3 receives items 3 and 8.

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives items of interest:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [0, 3, 8]
}
```

Each agent has been assigned items based on their valuation preferences, and all 9 items have been allocated.
