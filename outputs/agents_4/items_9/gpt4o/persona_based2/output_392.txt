Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  39  21  48  72  14   6  83  62
1  51   3  75  88  33  62  30  22  81
2  14  84  64  65  41  79  78  21  36
3   8  75  92  55  58  62  51  85  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a division that considers envy-freeness and balanced valuations, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Below is a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent has different valuations for each item, and our goal is to allocate the items such that perceived fairness is maximized.
   - We have a total of 9 items to allocate among 4 agents.

2. **Fair Division Strategy:**
   - We should first identify if any items have a significantly higher value for a particular agent compared to others; these can be allocated to that agent to maximize perceived fairness.
   - We aim to balance the total value of items each agent receives according to their valuations.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Look for items with the highest unique values for each agent and allocate those first.
   - Gradually allocate the remaining items, ensuring that no agent is disproportionately advantaged or disadvantaged.

**Fair Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**:
  - Valuations: 87 (0), 83 (7)
  - Allocate items 0 and 7 to Agent 0 since they value these items highly compared to others.

- **Agent 1**:
  - Valuations: 88 (3), 81 (8)
  - Allocate items 3 and 8 to Agent 1 for similar reasons.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Valuations: 84 (1), 79 (5)
  - Allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 2 to ensure they receive high-value items.

- **Agent 3**:
  - Valuations: 98 (8), 92 (2), 85 (7); however, 8 and 7 are already allocated, so consider:
  - Allocate items 2, 4, and 6 to Agent 3, ensuring they still receive valuable items based on remaining options.

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent receives, adhering to fairness principles.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their preferences and the goal of minimizing envy.
