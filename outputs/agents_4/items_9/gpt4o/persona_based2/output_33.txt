Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  85  12  22   2  24  51  81  70
1  86  25  13  53  87  33  53  56  86
2  19  26  25  35  52  41   2  23  65
3  86  61  90  39  78  63  28   7  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we should aim for a fair allocation where each agent's share is as equitable as possible, considering their valuations. One common criterion for fairness in such settings is "envy-freeness," where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations provided, we should try to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations, and no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 1 the most, followed by item 8, and item 6. Allocating these items to Agent 0 can maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the most, followed by items 0 and 8. We can allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has moderately low valuations across the board but values item 5 the most. Allocating item 5 to Agent 2 would be a good start. 
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 the most, followed by item 3. Allocating these two items should satisfy Agent 3.

Let's ensure each item is allocated and adjust as necessary:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 8, 6] (total items = 3)
- **Agent 1**: [0, 4] (total items = 2)
- **Agent 2**: [5] (total items = 1)
- **Agent 3**: [2, 3, 7] (total items = 3)

This allocation uses all 9 items. Each agent gets an integer number of items, and attempts to respect their valuations to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3, 7]
}
```
