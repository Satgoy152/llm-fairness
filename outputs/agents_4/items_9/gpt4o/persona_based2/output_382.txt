Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  14  39  99  26   3  87  73   2
1  63  52   1  15  63  23  11  58  66
2  57  43  87  90  77  40  12  44  89
3  45  71  39  28  26   2  90   8  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [45 71 39 28 26  2 90  8 46]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Given the matrix of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  14  39  99  26   3  87  73   2
1  63  52   1  15  63  23  11  58  66
2  57  43  87  90  77  40  12  44  89
3  45  71  39  28  26   2  90   8  46
```

We will use a strategy that involves analyzing the highest valuations and distributing items accordingly to minimize potential envy.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Assign high-value items**: Allocate items based on the highest valuations by each agent, ensuring the most valued items are given to the respective agents.
2. **Balance the allocations**: Distribute the remaining items such that every agent gets at least some items, and no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuations.

### Steps:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (value 99) and item 6 (value 87).
- Agent 1 highly values item 8 (value 66) and item 4 (value 63).
- Agent 2 highly values item 2 (value 87) and item 8 (value 89) but 8 is already taken, so item 3 (value 90) works.
- Agent 3 highly values item 6 (value 90) but 6 is already taken, so item 1 (value 71) is chosen.

### Allocation:

Let's distribute the items based on the highest values remaining:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6] (high values: 77, 87)
- Agent 1: Items [4, 8] (high values: 63, 66)
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3] (high values: 87, 90)
- Agent 3: Items [1, 7, 5] (high values: 71, 8, 2)

By ensuring these allocations, we attempt to minimize envy as much as possible based on their highest valuations. This is a simplified example and might not be perfect, but it tries to balance the allocation fairly.

### Final JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 7, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the total number of items allocated is 9. This allocation attempts to reflect a fair distribution based on the given matrix of valuations.
