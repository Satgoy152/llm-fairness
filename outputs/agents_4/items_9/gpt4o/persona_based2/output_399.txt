Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  91  79  82  38  66  80  30  12
1  97  62  45  78  80  64  84  44  54
2  42   7   8  32  57  68  30  10  13
3  98  94  60  36  69  39  68  17  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that considers the relative valuations of each agent for each item, striving for an envy-free distribution if possible. An envy-free distribution ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of goods assigned to another agent over their own bundle, given their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most, so we'll allocate item 1 to them.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most, so we'll allocate item 0 to them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most, so we'll allocate item 5 to them.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most, but since it's taken, we'll give them item 3, which is their next highest valued item that is available.

Next, we need to allocate the remaining items: 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

5. **Agent 0** values item 2 next highest after item 1, so give them item 2.
6. **Agent 1** values item 6 next highest, so give them item 6.
7. **Agent 2** values item 4 next highest after item 5, so give them item 4.
8. **Agent 3** values item 8 next highest after item 3, so give them item 8.

Finally, allocate the last item:
9. Item 7 is left, and while Agent 0 values it the least, they have the highest overall valuation for the items they have, so give it to Agent 0.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [3, 8]
}
```
This allocation attempts to balance the preferences of each agent while ensuring each has a fair share of items.
