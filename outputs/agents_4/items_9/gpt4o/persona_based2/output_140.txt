Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  32  29  96   1  67  93  96  45
1  61  40  95  61  49  80  59  57  72
2  64  50  38  97  96  91  56  18  56
3  45   5  61  66  58  79   0  88  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. One approach to achieve this is to use the Adjusted Winner procedure or similar fair division algorithms. However, given the constraints (integer allocations and a small number of items), a manual inspection can also work to ensure a fair division.

Let's consider each agent's preferences and attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

### Valuation Table:
- Agent 0's highest value items: 0 (98), 3 (96), 7 (96)
- Agent 1's highest value items: 2 (95), 5 (80), 8 (72)
- Agent 2's highest value items: 3 (97), 4 (96), 5 (91)
- Agent 3's highest value items: 5 (79), 7 (88), 3 (66)

### Initial Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items 0, 3, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items 2, 5, and 8.
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items 3, 4, and 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Prioritize items 5, 7, and 3.

### Allocation Attempts:
To ensure each agent gets a fair share and the total number of items is 9, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items 0, 3, 7 (high valuations and no overlap with other agents after initial allocation).

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Items 2, 8 (high valuation for 2, 8 is the next best available).

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Items 4, 5 (high valuation for 4 and 5).

- **Agent 3**: 
  - Item 6 (best available option without conflicting with high priority allocations of others).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are highly valued to them and attempts to minimize envy among agents.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 9 items among the 4 agents, considering their preferences as much as possible.
