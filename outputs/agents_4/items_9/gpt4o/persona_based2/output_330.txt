Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  23  28  94  50  33  98  76  30
1  93  92  30  98  30  13  73  27  83
2  32  88  17  83  87  82  14  65  89
3  43   1  87  75   5  84  84  68  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a manner that minimizes envy. One approach is the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which seeks to maximize the product of the utilities each agent receives based on their valuations.

Let's calculate an allocation that aims for fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items for Agent 0 are 6 (98), 3 (94), and 0 (82).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value items for Agent 1 are 3 (98), 0 (93), and 1 (92).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items for Agent 2 are 8 (89), 4 (87), and 1 (88).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value items for Agent 3 are 8 (94), 2 (87), and 5 (84).

Given these values, let's attempt to distribute the items while minimizing envy:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items [0, 6]. These are high-value items for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items [3]. This is the highest value item for Agent 1 that is not already taken.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items [1, 8]. These items are highly valued by Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Assign items [2, 4, 5, 7]. These are some of the next highest valued items for Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences and minimizes the potential for envy. Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [2, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 9 items while considering the valuations of the agents.
