Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  76  71  23  57  55  59  63  36
1  64  56  33  45  17  45  68  33  22
2  67  41  74  72  72  65  62  55  60
3  10  11  63  55   7  89  24  66  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an allocation that attempts to minimize envy among the agents. One common method to achieve this is using the Envy-Free (EF) allocation approach, where each agent should not prefer someone else's allocation over their own based on their valuations. However, given the constraints of integer allocations and the need to allocate all items, perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable. We'll try to find a balanced approach.

Let's start by examining the total valuation each agent has for all items:

1. Agent 0: 79 + 76 + 71 + 23 + 57 + 55 + 59 + 63 + 36 = 519
2. Agent 1: 64 + 56 + 33 + 45 + 17 + 45 + 68 + 33 + 22 = 383
3. Agent 2: 67 + 41 + 74 + 72 + 72 + 65 + 62 + 55 + 60 = 568
4. Agent 3: 10 + 11 + 63 + 55 + 7 + 89 + 24 + 66 + 81 = 406

Based on these valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items such that each agent gets a roughly proportional share of the total value they perceive.

Now, let's allocate items:

- **Agent 0** has the highest total valuation. It would be beneficial to allocate items that they value highly.
- **Agent 1** has the lowest total valuation, so allocating items they value relatively more could help.
- **Agent 2** has the highest total valuation, so they should receive a good portion of high-valued items.
- **Agent 3** has a moderate total valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign items to Agent 0 that they value highly: Items 0, 1
- Assign items to Agent 2 that they value highly: Items 2, 3
- Assign items to Agent 3 that they value highly: Items 5, 8
- Assign items to Agent 1 that they value highly: Items 6, 4
- The remaining item 7 can be given to Agent 3

This allocation attempts to balance the value assigned to each agent based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5, 8, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has at least one item.
