Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  38  38  91  73  38  16  10  69
1  42  47  70  14  32  80  75  28  57
2   9  26  19  34   8  67  48  86  60
3  99  18  17  16  48  81  97  91  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering envy-freeness, we can start by ensuring that each agent gets at least 2 items, as there are 9 items and 4 agents. We will use the concept of maximizing the minimum value allocated to each agent to achieve a fair division. 

Let's consider the valuations in the table and try to balance them across the agents. 

- **Agent 0**: High value in items 3 (91) and 4 (73).
- **Agent 1**: High value in items 5 (80) and 6 (75).
- **Agent 2**: High value in items 7 (86) and 8 (60).
- **Agent 3**: High value in items 0 (99) and 6 (97).

Considering these high-value items, we attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly, and we balance the remaining items to ensure fairness.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 0. This gives them a total value of 91 + 73 = 164.
- Assign items 5 and 6 to Agent 1. This gives them a total value of 80 + 75 = 155.
- Assign items 7 and 8 to Agent 2. This gives them a total value of 86 + 60 = 146.
- Assign items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 3. This gives them a total value of 99 + 18 + 17 = 134.

This allocation attempts to balance the total values perceived by each agent, aiming for fairness by ensuring that each agent gets a significant portion of their highest-valued items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

Each agent receives at least 2 items, and the total number of items allocated is 9, satisfying the requirement.
