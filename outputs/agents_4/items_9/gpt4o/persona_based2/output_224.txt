Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  10  99  97  36  87  37  28  22
1   1  53  79   0  21   8  86  32  83
2  64  36  30  84  42  91  97  60  50
3  11  83  13  22  52  96  20  54  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. One approach to achieving a fair division is to use an envy-free allocation method, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations, let's try to allocate items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 and 3. We can allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 6 and 8. We can allocate these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 5 and 6. However, item 6 is already allocated to Agent 1, so we allocate item 5 and another item with a high value for Agent 2, like item 0.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 1 and 5. Since item 5 is allocated to Agent 2, we allocate item 1 and another item with a reasonably high value, like item 4.

We now have:
- Agent 0: items 2, 3
- Agent 1: items 6, 8
- Agent 2: items 0, 5
- Agent 3: items 1, 4

We have allocated 8 items so far. Let's allocate the remaining item (7) to Agent 1, who has a relatively good valuation for it.

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [6, 8, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed among the agents, attempting to consider their valuations to minimize envy and provide a fair division.
