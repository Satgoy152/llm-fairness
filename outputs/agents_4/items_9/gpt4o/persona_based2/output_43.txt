Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54   8  47  51   1   0  65  76  35
1  58  86  49  71  60  47  29  41  15
2  76  42  66  35  77   2  28  19  92
3   9  22  13  44  57  76  97   8  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this fair division problem, we should aim for an allocation strategy that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One common approach to achieve fairness is by using the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, where no agent should envy another agent's allocation after possibly removing one item from the other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations matrix, we can attempt to allocate the items in a way that distributes value evenly among the agents. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation without creating significant envy.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Allocate high-value items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives a similar total value.

Let's go through a possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 6 highly (65) and item 0 (54). Assign items 6 and 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highly (86) and item 3 (71). Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 8 highly (92) and item 4 (77). Assign items 8 and 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 highly (76) and item 7 (8). Assign items 5 and 7 to Agent 3.

After this initial allocation, we have distributed 8 items. We need to allocate one more item to ensure all items are allocated.

5. **Remaining item (2)**: Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they have the highest remaining valuation for it.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [8, 4],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent, considering their preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated.
