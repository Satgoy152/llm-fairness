Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86   6  79  39  30  88  49  67  52
1  42  13  97  21  11  74  35  41  76
2   7  18  14  55   5  62  80  56  67
3  81  28  36  26  42  96  51  50  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent values their allocation as highly as possible. Here's a possible approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** Sum the values each agent assigns to all items to understand each agent's total valuation landscape.
2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:** Allocate items to agents such that each agent gets items they value highly compared to others, while ensuring that the total number of allocated items equals the number of items available.

Below are the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 496
- Agent 1: 410
- Agent 2: 364
- Agent 3: 428

3. **Iterative Allocation:** Assign items to agents by iterating over items and assigning them to the agent who values them most, without causing excessive envy or imbalance.

Here's a feasible allocation respecting the constraints:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 8
- Agent 1 gets items: 2, 5
- Agent 2 gets items: 6, 7
- Agent 3 gets items: 1, 3, 4

This allocation aims to balance the values each agent receives and minimize envy by giving each agent some of the items they value highly.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
