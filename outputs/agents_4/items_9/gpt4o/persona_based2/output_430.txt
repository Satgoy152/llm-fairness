Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  28  28  10  22  57  79  83  84
1  34  53  91  78   2  97  52  93  52
2  92  28  49   6  15  39  67  35  99
3  96  28  85   6  80  80  77  63  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to distribute them such that each agent feels they received a fair share relative to their preferences.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (84) and item 8 (84).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 (97) and item 2 (91).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 8 (99).
   - Agent 3 highly values item 0 (96).

2. **Start with Highest Valuations:**
   - Give item 5 to agent 1 (value 97).
   - Give item 8 to agent 2 (value 99).
   - Give item 0 to agent 3 (value 96).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - For agent 0, allocate items 7 (value 83) and 6 (value 79).
   - For agent 1, allocate item 2 (value 91).
   - For agent 2, allocate item 4 (value 15).
   - For agent 3, allocate item 3 (value 6) and item 1 (value 28).

### Resulting Allocation:

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest preferences, aiming to reduce envy. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 9 items, respects the agents' preferences, and attempts to achieve fairness by maximizing the utility for each agent based on their valuations.
