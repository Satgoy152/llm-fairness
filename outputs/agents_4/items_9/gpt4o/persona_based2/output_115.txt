Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  48  76  63  56  62  51  89  70
1  56  65  26  89   3  88  37  14  98
2  51  33  71  84  79  59  31  32   6
3  24  48  41  50   1  44   4  96  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible, possibly minimizing envy and ensuring a sense of fairness according to the agents' valuations.

A useful concept for this is the "envy-free" allocation, where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, given their valuation. However, achieving complete envy-freeness with integer allocations and without allowing agents to receive fractional items can be challenging. Instead, we can aim to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction and is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 8.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 7, but already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 5.

We continue this process, considering remaining items and maximizing each agent's satisfaction while being mindful of each agent's total number of items.

Here's a suggested allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 7, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 8, 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 4, 0
- **Agent 3**: Items 5, 1, 2

This allocation tries to balance high-value items among agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Finally, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [8, 3],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [5, 1, 2]
}
```
