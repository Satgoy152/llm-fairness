Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  86  77  56  39  58  28  52  13
1  75  48  41  11  78  50  18  65   0
2  76   2  79  19   8  24  88  80  45
3  83  29  59  26   8  10  65  53  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free division as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Although achieving perfect envy-freeness with discrete items may not always be possible, we will attempt to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's consider the following strategy for allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations for items 1 and 2.
   - Allocation: Items [1, 2]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation for item 4.
   - Allocation: Item [4]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations for items 6 and 7.
   - Allocation: Items [6, 7]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations for items 0, 3, 5, and 8.
   - Allocation: Items [0, 3, 5, 8]

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated once and only once. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring an integer allocation. Each agent receives a number of items that corresponds to their relative valuations, aiming to minimize potential envy among them.
