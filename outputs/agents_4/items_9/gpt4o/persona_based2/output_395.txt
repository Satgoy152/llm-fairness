Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  13  15  54  79  32  65   6  15
1  48  25  65  74   8  89  46  42  57
2  49  78  58  87  60  27  81  15  77
3  52   8  78  84  54   4  65  32  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a share of the items that maximizes their individual valuations while minimizing envy. One way to approach this problem is by using an envy-free allocation method like the adjusted winner procedure, but since this requires finer granularity, we will use a heuristic approach to distribute the items fairly based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items so that fairness is maintained:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (79), Item 3 (54), Item 6 (65)
   - Let's assign Item 4 and Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (89), Item 3 (74), Item 2 (65)
   - Item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, so let's assign Item 5 and Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (87), Item 1 (78), Item 6 (81)
   - Item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, and Item 6 is a high-value item for others as well. Let's assign Item 1 and Item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (84), Item 2 (78), Item 0 (52)
   - Item 3 and Item 2 are already allocated. Let's assign Item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have assigned 7 items, and Items 7 and 8 are left. Let's allocate these remaining items to ensure each agent gets a fair distribution based on remaining valuations:

- Assign Item 7 to Agent 3 (value 32).
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 2 (value 77).

After this allocation, each agent has received items based on their highest valuations, and all 9 items have been distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 6, 8],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed.
