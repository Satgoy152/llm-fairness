Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  63   3  18   4  67  82  29  86
1  53  96  12  16  13  95  51  72  85
2  86  30  91  44  35  11  21  36  44
3  29  19  63  32   2  87  62  43  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that attempts to minimize envy and distribute the items based on individual valuations, we can use an algorithmic approach inspired by fair division principles such as the Max-Min Fairness or the Envy-Free criterion. However, since achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations is not always feasible, we aim to make the distribution as equitable as possible given the constraints.

Let's allocate the items using a heuristic that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations:

1. **Initialization:** List all items and their valuations for each agent.
2. **Allocation Strategy:** Use a round-robin method where each agent picks the item they value the most among the remaining items. This ensures that at each step, the agent gets the most value possible from the available options.
3. **Repeat** until all items are allocated.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

**Round 1:**
- Agent 0 picks item 8 (value 86).
- Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 96).
- Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 91).
- Agent 3 picks item 5 (value 87).

**Round 2:**
- Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 82).
- Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 95) - already taken, so next highest is item 7 (value 72).
- Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 86) - already taken, so next highest is item 0 (value 86) - already taken, next is item 3 (value 44).
- Agent 3 picks item 8 (value 49) - already taken, so next highest is item 7 (value 43) - already taken, so finally item 3 (value 32).

**Round 3:**
- Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 63) - already taken, next highest is item 0 (value 31).
- Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 13).
- Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 35) - already taken, so next item 6 (value 21).
- Agent 3 has no items left to choose from.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6, 0],
    "1": [1, 7, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a number of items proportional to their valuation preferences, while acknowledging that perfect envy-freeness is not feasible with such discrete allocations.
