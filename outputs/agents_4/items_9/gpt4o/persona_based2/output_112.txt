Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  62  80  65  65  85  28  91  74
1  10  21  25  42  63  36  14  53  24
2  63  15  12  85  43   0  81  77  44
3  16  51   8  30  18  24  50  62  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, achieving a form of envy-freeness. We'll try to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: 72, 62, 80, 65, 65, 85, 28, 91, 74 (Total = 622)
   - Agent 1: 10, 21, 25, 42, 63, 36, 14, 53, 24 (Total = 288)
   - Agent 2: 63, 15, 12, 85, 43, 0, 81, 77, 44 (Total = 420)
   - Agent 3: 16, 51, 8, 30, 18, 24, 50, 62, 61 (Total = 320)

2. **Prioritize Items Based on Preferences:**
   - Assign items based on the highest value each agent has for any item, reducing the potential for envy.

3. **Initial Assignments:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest preference for item 7 (91).
   - Agent 1 has the highest preference for item 4 (63).
   - Agent 2 has the highest preference for item 3 (85).
   - Agent 3 has the highest preference for item 8 (61).

4. **Continue Assigning Remaining Items:**
   - Distribute remaining items while maintaining balance in total values among agents.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Distribute remaining items to maintain a balance in total values received by each agent, ensuring no agent feels envious.

Let's proceed with a fair allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 5 (Values: 72, 85)
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4 (Values: 25, 63)
- Agent 2: Items 3, 6 (Values: 85, 81)
- Agent 3: Items 1, 7, 8 (Values: 51, 62, 61)

This allocation ensures each agent has items that maximize their individual valuations, aiming for minimal envy among agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 7, 8]
}
```
