Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  32  51  21  94  17  16  82  19
1  19  54  53  62  56  44  38  74  22
2  74   6  26  91  55  86   3  68  39
3  74  54  25  24  88  87  90  35  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, a common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction (utilitarian approach) or trying to achieve envy-freeness. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness in discrete allocation with integer constraints is not always possible, but we can aim to minimize envy.

Given the agents' valuations for each item, let's try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. We'll consider the valuations of the agents and try to allocate items in a way that maximizes fairness.

The valuations matrix is as follows:

```
Agent 0: [9, 32, 51, 21, 94, 17, 16, 82, 19]
Agent 1: [19, 54, 53, 62, 56, 44, 38, 74, 22]
Agent 2: [74, 6, 26, 91, 55, 86, 3, 68, 39]
Agent 3: [74, 54, 25, 24, 88, 87, 90, 35, 77]
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Balance the Total Value**: Aim to allocate items such that the total value received by each agent is as equal as possible.

2. **Prioritize High Valuations**: Assign items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the total value.

3. **Integer Allocation**: Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

### Proposed Allocation

After considering these factors, here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 4]
  - Total Value: 32 + 94 = 126

- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 7]
  - Total Value: 62 + 74 = 136

- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 8]
  - Total Value: 86 + 39 = 125

- **Agent 3**: Items [0, 2, 6]
  - Total Value: 74 + 25 + 90 = 189

This allocation aims to balance the total value as much as possible given the integer constraints and the agents' preferences.

### JSON Representation of the Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [0, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
