Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  47  42  91   5  17  21  32  35
1  24  71  15   9  78  22  38  70   2
2   2  36  81  14  93   8  64  49  35
3  13  23  77  23  26  23   8   3  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to reduce envy between agents. One common approach is to use an envy-free algorithm like the "round-robin" method or maximizing Nash social welfare. However, for simplicity, we can proceed with a heuristic approach that balances the total value each agent receives.

First, let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 94 + 47 + 42 + 91 + 5 + 17 + 21 + 32 + 35 = 384
- Agent 1: 24 + 71 + 15 + 9 + 78 + 22 + 38 + 70 + 2 = 329
- Agent 2: 2 + 36 + 81 + 14 + 93 + 8 + 64 + 49 + 35 = 382
- Agent 3: 13 + 23 + 77 + 23 + 26 + 23 + 8 + 3 + 82 = 278

Given the total valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Let's attempt an allocation:

1. **Allocate items to maximize individual agent satisfaction initially and then balance it:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 and item 3. Assign them first.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 and item 4 highly. Assign them first.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 and item 6 highly. Assign them first.
   - Agent 3 values item 8 highly. Assign it first.

2. **Distribute remaining items to balance the total values:**
   - Remaining items are 5 and 7.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 to balance their value as they have a high valuation for it.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1 to increase their lower total value.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 4, 7]
- Agent 2: [2, 5, 6]
- Agent 3: [8]

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while considering their preferences.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6],
    "3": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed.
