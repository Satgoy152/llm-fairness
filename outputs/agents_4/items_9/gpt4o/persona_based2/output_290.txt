Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  36  75  22  97  55  95  96  16
1  76  85  51  26  49  32  38  26  80
2  82  22  17  86  98  89  41  30  31
3  61  77  47  57  11  84  54  83  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for a division that minimizes envy and tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives. This is a complex problem, and achieving complete envy-freeness is often difficult, but we can aim for a fair allocation based on the given valuations.

Let's consider each agent's preferences and try to allocate the items so that each agent receives items they value highly, while also considering the overall distribution of value. Here's a strategy to achieve a fair allocation:

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4. We allocate some of these high-value items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly, which is not highly valued by others. We allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most, but since it is already considered for Agent 0, we find alternatives. Agent 2 also values item 3 highly.
4. **Agent 3** has a strong preference for item 7.

We'll balance these considerations to ensure each agent gets valuable items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (third-highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (second-highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (second-highest value for Agent 3).

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, aiming to reduce envy and balance the total value each agent derives from their allocation.
