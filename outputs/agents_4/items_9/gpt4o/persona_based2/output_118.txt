Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  53  15  43  76  37  69  99  58
1  82  72  51  30  36  94  90  28  41
2  26  31  19  15  57  21  41  47   6
3  89  65  48  75  49  74   6  82  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's utility while ensuring that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation. Given the valuations matrix, we can try to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Different agents value items differently. For instance, agent 0 values item 7 highly (99), while agent 3 values item 0 highly (89).
   - We should try to distribute the items such that the agents receive items they value highly.

2. **Greedy Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate items to agents one by one, choosing the item that provides the highest value to any of the agents that still have items left.

3. **Allocation Process**:
   - **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (89) and item 3 (75), so let's assign these items to agent 3.
   - **Agent 0** highly values item 7 (99), so let's assign this item to agent 0.
   - **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (94) and item 6 (90), so let's assign these items to agent 1.
   - **Agent 0** also values item 4 (76) highly, so let's assign this item to agent 0.
   - **Agent 3** values item 8 (68) reasonably well, so let's assign it to agent 3.
   - **Agent 1** values item 1 (72) higher than the remaining agents, so let's assign this item to agent 1.
   - **Agent 2** can be given the remaining item 2 (19), which is not highly valued by others but is the best remaining option for agent 2.

This allocation is aimed at maximizing the value each agent can extract from the items, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items they value relatively highly.
