Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  25  76  65  59  28  20  36  90
1  59  49  97  76  29  50  83  89  18
2   3  72  54  33  17  57  52  39   7
3  18  11  18  44  49  16  21   2  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims to be envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we should first consider each agent's preferences and attempt to maximize their satisfaction with the allocation. We will use a method that balances fairness and efficiency. The goal is to ensure each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value based on their own valuations.

Let's first summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 83 + 25 + 76 + 65 + 59 + 28 + 20 + 36 + 90 = 482
- Agent 1: 59 + 49 + 97 + 76 + 29 + 50 + 83 + 89 + 18 = 550
- Agent 2: 3 + 72 + 54 + 33 + 17 + 57 + 52 + 39 + 7 = 334
- Agent 3: 18 + 11 + 18 + 44 + 49 + 16 + 21 + 2 + 75 = 254

Now, let's proceed with an allocation strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's total perceived value while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (97), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (83), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** values item 8 the most (75), so allocate item 8 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (72), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now we have:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [8]

Remaining items to allocate: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

Continue with the next best valuations for each agent:

5. **Agent 1** values item 7 the second most (89), so allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 0** values item 4 the second most (59), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 2** values item 5 the second most (57), so allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
8. **Agent 3** values item 3 second most (44), so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now we have:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [2, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 5]
- Agent 3: [8, 3]

One item remains to be allocated: item 6.

9. **Agent 1** values item 6 next (83), so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

After allocating the remaining item, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 7, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [8, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring that all items are distributed.
