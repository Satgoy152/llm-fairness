Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  25  53  86  96  40  33  71  77
1  75  52  14  98  55  62  21  85  73
2  13  98  54  94  73  10  24  67  58
3  80  26  70  46  72  80  52  58  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations provided, I will attempt to make a reasonable allocation of the 9 items among the 4 agents.

### Valuation Matrix:
- Agent 0: [5, 25, 53, 86, 96, 40, 33, 71, 77]
- Agent 1: [75, 52, 14, 98, 55, 62, 21, 85, 73]
- Agent 2: [13, 98, 54, 94, 73, 10, 24, 67, 58]
- Agent 3: [80, 26, 70, 46, 72, 80, 52, 58, 28]

### Strategy:
1. **Maximize each agent's total value**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations first.
2. **Ensure envy-freeness**: Try to minimize envy by ensuring each agent feels they received a fair share relative to others.
3. **Integer allocation**: Each agent should receive a whole number of items.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest (96), then item 3 (86).
- **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (98), then item 0 (75).
- **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest (98), then item 3 (94).
- **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest (80), then item 5 (80).

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [4, 6] total value = 96 + 33 = 129
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 8] total value = 98 + 73 = 171
- **Agent 2**: Items [1] total value = 98
- **Agent 3**: Items [0, 2, 5, 7] total value = 80 + 70 + 80 + 58 = 288

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a significant portion of the total value according to their preferences, which should help in reducing envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2, 5, 7]
}
```
This allocation provides each agent with an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated among the agents.
