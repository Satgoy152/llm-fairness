Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  57  63   9  21  64  59  10   3
1  55  57  66  80  51   5  92  49  73
2  18  14  40  63  55  65  81  83  94
3  35  29  48  70  34  64  50  60   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a systematic approach like the Maximin Share (MMS) allocation. The Maximin Share ensures each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as highly as possible, given the constraints of the allocation.

First, let's calculate a potential Maximin Share for each agent by dividing the total value of all items by the number of agents, and ensuring each agent gets a bundle valued at least as high as this share.

1. Calculate the total value for each agent:
   - Agent 0: \(1 + 57 + 63 + 9 + 21 + 64 + 59 + 10 + 3 = 287\)
   - Agent 1: \(55 + 57 + 66 + 80 + 51 + 5 + 92 + 49 + 73 = 528\)
   - Agent 2: \(18 + 14 + 40 + 63 + 55 + 65 + 81 + 83 + 94 = 513\)
   - Agent 3: \(35 + 29 + 48 + 70 + 34 + 64 + 50 + 60 + 4 = 394\)

2. Determine the Maximin Share (MMS) for each agent:
   - Total value of items for all agents: \(287 + 528 + 513 + 394 = 1722\)
   - Maximin Share per agent: \( \text{Total value} / \text{Number of agents} = 1722 / 4 = 430.5\)

3. Allocate items to agents to maximize their individual valuations while aiming to meet the MMS for each agent.

Now, let's attempt an allocation that approaches these shares:

- Agent 0 values: [1, 57, 63, 9, 21, 64, 59, 10, 3]
- Agent 1 values: [55, 57, 66, 80, 51, 5, 92, 49, 73]
- Agent 2 values: [18, 14, 40, 63, 55, 65, 81, 83, 94]
- Agent 3 values: [35, 29, 48, 70, 34, 64, 50, 60, 4]

Let's construct a fair allocation:

1. Allocate item 6 (value 92) to Agent 1
2. Allocate item 8 (value 94) to Agent 2
3. Allocate item 3 (value 70) to Agent 3
4. Allocate item 5 (value 64) to Agent 0
5. Allocate item 2 (value 66) to Agent 1
6. Allocate item 7 (value 83) to Agent 2
7. Allocate item 1 (value 57) to Agent 0
8. Allocate item 4 (value 51) to Agent 1
9. Allocate item 0 (value 18) to Agent 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations and aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [6, 2, 4],
    "2": [8, 7, 0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a fair share of items based on their individual valuations while ensuring all 9 items are allocated.
