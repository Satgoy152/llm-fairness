Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  99  69  30  37  39  77  23  71
1  12  13  12  99  14   2  45  11  24
2   0  77  47  84  88  44  44  71  52
3   1  51  48  26  97   1  31  64  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should strive for an envy-free distribution where each agent receives their most valued items relative to the others, as much as possible. This process involves considering each agent's valuation of the items and trying to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated.

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 6.
- **Agent 1** has a particularly high valuation for item 3.
- **Agent 2** values items 4, 3, and 1 highly.
- **Agent 3** values items 4 and 8 highly.

To attempt a fair distribution, we aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's total value according to their preferences while ensuring every item is allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 6 (valuations: 99 and 77).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3 (valuation: 99).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items 4, 0, and 2 (valuations: 88, 0, and 47).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items 8, 5, and 7 (valuations: 85, 1, and 64).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable portion of their higher-valued items, and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 0, 2],
    "3": [8, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items, with each agent receiving an integer number of items, while attempting to respect their preferences as much as possible.
