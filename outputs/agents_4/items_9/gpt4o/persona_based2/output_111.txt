Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  93  19  95  75  85  31  60  74
1  29  23  60  92  83  32  32  50  97
2  93  47  44  72   2  46  73  80  51
3  68  75  47   3  99  76  25  47  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close as possible to being envy-free. This means each agent should be as satisfied as possible with their allocated items relative to their valuations. Here’s a possible allocation approach:

First, we calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 74 + 93 + 19 + 95 + 75 + 85 + 31 + 60 + 74 = 606
- Agent 1: 29 + 23 + 60 + 92 + 83 + 32 + 32 + 50 + 97 = 498
- Agent 2: 93 + 47 + 44 + 72 + 2 + 46 + 73 + 80 + 51 = 508
- Agent 3: 68 + 75 + 47 + 3 + 99 + 76 + 25 + 47 + 17 = 457

To allocate items, we try to balance the total value of items each agent receives while respecting their preferences.

Let's begin by assigning items based on the highest individual valuations to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 at 95 and item 1 at 93. Assign them these items.
2. **Agent 1** values item 8 at 97 and item 3 at 92. Since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, assign item 8.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 at 93 and item 6 at 73. Assign them item 0.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 at 99 and item 5 at 76. Assign them item 4.

Next, we continue assigning remaining items while trying to balance the total value received by each agent:

- **Agent 0** has items 3 and 1. Assign item 0 to maximize their valuation.
- **Agent 1** has item 8. Assign item 2 (value 60) since item 3 was taken.
- **Agent 2** has item 0. Assign item 7 (value 80) for maximum benefit.
- **Agent 3** has item 4. Assign item 5 (value 76) and item 6 (value 25).

Finally, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [8, 2],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly based on the agents’ valuations, ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share.
