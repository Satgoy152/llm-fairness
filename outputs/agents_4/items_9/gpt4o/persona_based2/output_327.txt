Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  49   6  49  58  41  34  85  30
1  50  29  72  92  88  44  60  66  86
2  20  42  82  65  48  71  49  17  41
3  66  56  19  95  59  23  55  26  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a common fair division method such as the "Round Robin" or "Greedy" algorithm. The goal is to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given that there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent should receive approximately 2 or 3 items. We will aim to make the allocations as balanced as possible.

Let's perform a fair division based on each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 3 (95), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 4 (88), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 7 (85), so we allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 2 (82), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

After this initial allocation, we have allocated 4 items, with 5 remaining.

5. Now, looking at the remaining items, let's allocate item 8 to **Agent 1** (value 86), as it is their highest remaining preference.
6. Allocate item 6 to **Agent 1** (value 60), which is the next highest preference for this agent among unallocated items.
7. Allocate item 0 to **Agent 3** (value 66), as it is their next highest preference among unallocated items.
8. Allocate item 1 to **Agent 2** (value 42), which is their highest remaining preference.
9. Allocate item 5 to **Agent 0** (value 41), which is their highest remaining preference.

After this allocation, all 9 items are distributed among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [4, 6, 8],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, with 9 items distributed in total.
