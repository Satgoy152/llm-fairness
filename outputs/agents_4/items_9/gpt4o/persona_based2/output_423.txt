Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  83  27  26   0  85  71  65  36
1  42  38  43  47  45   9  95  93   9
2  51  54  10  78  61  52  35  18  66
3  87  13  38  23  63  34  39  40  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the Nash product (the product of utilities) to ensure a more equitable distribution. This approach aims to balance the utility each agent receives and minimize envy.

Below, I will outline a potential strategy to allocate the items among the agents:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Attempt to allocate items such that the distribution is as balanced as possible, trying to maximize each agent's utility while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Calculations:

- **Agent 0 Total Valuation:** 58 + 83 + 27 + 26 + 0 + 85 + 71 + 65 + 36 = 451
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation:** 42 + 38 + 43 + 47 + 45 + 9 + 95 + 93 + 9 = 421
- **Agent 2 Total Valuation:** 51 + 54 + 10 + 78 + 61 + 52 + 35 + 18 + 66 = 425
- **Agent 3 Total Valuation:** 87 + 13 + 38 + 23 + 63 + 34 + 39 + 40 + 92 = 429

Next, we'll assign items to agents to balance the total value received by each agent:

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0:** High valuation on item 1 and 5.
- **Agent 1:** High valuation on items 6 and 7.
- **Agent 2:** Moderate distribution across items.
- **Agent 3:** High valuation on items 0 and 8.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [1, 5]
- **Agent 1:** Items [6, 7]
- **Agent 2:** Items [2, 3, 4]
- **Agent 3:** Items [0, 8]

This allocation attempts to maximize individual satisfaction while distributing items fairly.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 4],
    "3": [0, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total value, considering their preferences while making sure all items are distributed without any being left out.
