Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  77   1   6  69  39  47  85  33
1   0  81  98  22  51  36  79  19  31
2  49  89   7  71  94   4  84   7  95
3  65  31   9  84  30  20  42   5  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents with the goal of minimizing envy and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can utilize a method that balances the distribution based on the agents' valuations. Our objective is to find an allocation that is as equitable as possible given the constraints.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0: 40 + 77 + 1 + 6 + 69 + 39 + 47 + 85 + 33 = 397
   - Agent 1: 0 + 81 + 98 + 22 + 51 + 36 + 79 + 19 + 31 = 417
   - Agent 2: 49 + 89 + 7 + 71 + 94 + 4 + 84 + 7 + 95 = 500
   - Agent 3: 65 + 31 + 9 + 84 + 30 + 20 + 42 + 5 + 85 = 371

2. **Determine the Highest Valuation for Each Item Across Agents:**  
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values the highest at 49
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values the highest at 89
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values the highest at 98
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values the highest at 84
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values the highest at 94
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values the highest at 39
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values the highest at 84
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values the highest at 85
   - Item 8: Agent 2 values the highest at 95

3. **Assign Items to Agents Who Value Them Most:**  
   - Agent 0: Item 5, Item 7
   - Agent 1: Item 2
   - Agent 2: Item 0, Item 1, Item 4, Item 6, Item 8
   - Agent 3: Item 3

This assignment ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it most, making the allocation as fair as possible based on individual preferences.

Finally, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 4, 6, 8],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This solution ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items, with a focus on minimizing envy by assigning items based on highest valuations.
