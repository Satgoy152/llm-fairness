Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  37   6  59  45  56  28   5  56
1  73  47  88  24  81  41  38  84  81
2  15  42  32  70   7  29  97  39  29
3   3  95  64  55  55  48  80  92  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness as a guiding principle. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation. We will also ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Allocate items sequentially to the agent who values the item the most, ensuring no envy arises.
3. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's perform the calculations and allocations:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation
- Agent 0: Total value = 86 + 37 + 6 + 59 + 45 + 56 + 28 + 5 + 56 = 378
- Agent 1: Total value = 73 + 47 + 88 + 24 + 81 + 41 + 38 + 84 + 81 = 557
- Agent 2: Total value = 15 + 42 + 32 + 70 + 7 + 29 + 97 + 39 + 29 = 360
- Agent 3: Total value = 3 + 95 + 64 + 55 + 55 + 48 + 80 + 92 + 14 = 506

### Step 2: Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation
- Item 0: Highest valuation is Agent 0 (86)
- Item 1: Highest valuation is Agent 3 (95)
- Item 2: Highest valuation is Agent 1 (88)
- Item 3: Highest valuation is Agent 2 (70)
- Item 4: Highest valuation is Agent 1 (81)
- Item 5: Highest valuation is Agent 0 (56)
- Item 6: Highest valuation is Agent 2 (97)
- Item 7: Highest valuation is Agent 3 (92)
- Item 8: Highest valuation is Agent 1 (81)

### Step 3: Resolve Envy and Finalize Allocation
- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 7]

This allocation ensures each agent gets items valued highly by them, which minimizes potential envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 8],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
