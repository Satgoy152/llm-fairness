Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  28  71  45  19  72  63  17  90
1  94  49   2  14   2  16  32  34  39
2  28  69  79  77  11  36  98  75  73
3  51  48  23  69  84  28  87  28  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations provided in the table. The goal is to make the allocation as envy-free (or as fair) as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation based on the valuations they have.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [68, 28, 71, 45, 19, 72, 63, 17, 90]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [94, 49, 2, 14, 2, 16, 32, 34, 39]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [28, 69, 79, 77, 11, 36, 98, 75, 73]
- Agent 3 values the items as follows: [51, 48, 23, 69, 84, 28, 87, 28, 22]

To find a fair allocation, we will try to maximize each agent's satisfaction by allocating items they highly value while ensuring each agent receives roughly an equal total valuation. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, 5, and 8.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 and 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 6, 2, and 3.
4. Agent 3 highly values items 4, 3, and 6.

Keeping these preferences in mind, we can try to allocate the items so that each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 8
  - Total value = 68 + 90 = 158
- Agent 1: Items 1, 7
  - Total value = 49 + 34 = 83
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6
  - Total value = 79 + 98 = 177
- Agent 3: Items 3, 4, 5
  - Total value = 69 + 84 + 28 = 181

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and the total valuation for each agent is roughly balanced across all agents.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
