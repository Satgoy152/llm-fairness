Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  15  95  23  31  68  75  19  10
1  80  12  87  34  22  59  14  99   1
2  34  73  75  52  40  34  70  49  25
3  42  51  46  58  32  17  53  16  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a very high valuation for item 2 (95), which is significantly higher than their valuation of other items. Allocating item 2 to Agent 0 should be a priority to maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 7 (99), and this is the highest single valuation across all agents and items. Therefore, it would be envy-free to allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Has relatively balanced valuations, but item 1 (73) and item 6 (70) seem to be of higher interest. Allocating these to Agent 2 could maximize their satisfaction.

4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (58) among all agents, so assigning item 3 to Agent 3 would be beneficial. Additionally, item 4 (32) and item 5 (17) have relatively higher valuations for Agent 3 compared to other agents' valuations for these items.

5. We need to ensure all items are allocated, and it's important to fill in the remaining slots for each agent to balance the allocation.

Here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 0] - Item 2 for high valuation, item 0 as a filler.
- Agent 1: [7, 8] - Item 7 for high valuation, item 8 as a filler.
- Agent 2: [1, 6] - Items 1 and 6 for relatively high interest.
- Agent 3: [3, 4, 5] - Items 3, 4, and 5 to maximize valuation.

This allocation respects the valuations and attempts to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
