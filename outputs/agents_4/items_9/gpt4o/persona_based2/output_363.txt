Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  44   0  87  81  67  79  74  93
1  65  58  83  86   3  76  52  14  76
2  15  47  54  92  60  94  23  46  52
3  41  51  24  52  81   2   2  65  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and attempt to reach envy-freeness in this allocation problem, we can utilize a method such as the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking the most valuable item available to them. Given the valuations provided, I'll attempt to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Round 1:**
    - **Agent 0** picks item 8 (value 93).
    - **Agent 1** picks item 3 (value 86).
    - **Agent 2** picks item 5 (value 94).
    - **Agent 3** picks item 4 (value 81).

2. **Round 2:**
    - **Agent 0** picks item 7 (value 74).
    - **Agent 1** picks item 2 (value 83).
    - **Agent 2** picks item 3 is already taken, so picks item 1 (value 47).
    - **Agent 3** picks item 0 (value 41).

3. **Round 3 (final items):**
    - **Agent 0** picks item 6 (value 79).
    - **Agent 1** picks item 1 is already taken, so picks item 5 is already taken, and picks item 2 is already taken, so picks item 4 is already taken, so picks item 8 (value 76).
    - **Agent 2** and **Agent 3** have no remaining items to pick.

### Final Allocations:

```
{
    "0": [8, 7, 6],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation assigns each agent specific items based on their preferences, ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly, thereby reducing potential envy between agents.
