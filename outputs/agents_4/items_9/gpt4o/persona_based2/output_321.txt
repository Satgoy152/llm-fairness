Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  10  54  24  82  49  59  44  50
1  26  87  62  10  86  84  45  90  25
2  66  40  62  36  21  13  22  89  97
3  95  37  55  28  26  48  11  25  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, we can use a fair division algorithm like the Envy-Free Matching method. This method aims to minimize envy by allocating items based on each agent's valuation.

Here is a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 4 the highest at 82. We assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 7 the highest at 90. We assign item 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 8 the highest at 97. We assign item 8 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 the highest at 95. We assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent has received their most valued item from the initial choice. We proceed to allocate the remaining items:

5. **Remaining items**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

- Agent 0: Values item 6 next highest at 59. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
  
- Agent 1: Values item 5 next highest at 84. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
  
- Agent 2: Values item 2 next highest at 62. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

- Agent 3: Values item 3 next highest at 28. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Finally, the last remaining item:

- Agent 0: Values item 1 at 10, which is the lowest compared to other values but to ensure all items are allocated, assign item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation balances the agents' preferences across their highest valued items and ensures each agent gets a fair share of the total value. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 1],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [8, 2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed while attempting to minimize envy and respecting each agent's preferences.
