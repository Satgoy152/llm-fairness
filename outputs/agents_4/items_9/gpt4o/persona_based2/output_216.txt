Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  21  18  52  61   2  14  52  29
1  27  29  85  74  97  98  75  83  12
2  56  79  84  93   0  90  39  57   4
3  45   9  95  46  33  13  98  19  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for an envy-free distribution as much as possible, we can use a method inspired by the notion of maximizing the minimum utility or minimizing envy among the worst-off agent. This is a complex problem, but a simple heuristic approach can be applied to achieve a reasonably fair allocation.

First, let's analyze the valuations and distribute items by picking the highest value for each item across different agents under the constraint that each agent should get at least one item. We will use a greedy algorithm to allocate items to agents based on their highest value for each item, while ensuring that no agent is left without items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1** values item 5 the most (98) and item 4 (97). Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (93) and item 2 (84). Assign items 3 and 2 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 3** values item 6 the most (98). Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** can then be given items that are not strongly preferred by others. Assign items 0, 1, 7, and 8 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7, 8],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items and ensures that each agent receives at least one item.
