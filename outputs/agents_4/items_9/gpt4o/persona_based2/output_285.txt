Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  32  77  64  66  71  43  47  22
1  46  91  87  89   8  53  21  28  76
2  40  67  62  21  65  25   1  35  73
3  31  22  91  39  88  74  88  17  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free (or as close to envy-free as possible), we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to allocate them in a way that each agent feels they are receiving their fair share, or at least not envious of another agent's allocation. 

One common method for such allocation is to use an iterative process that attempts to balance the perceived value of each agent's bundle by maximizing the minimum value each agent would assign to their own allocation. Hereâ€™s one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   - Try to ensure each agent receives items that match their preferences as much as possible.

2. **Iterative Adjustment:**
   - Adjust allocations to minimize envy, considering each agent's valuations.

Let's calculate and allocate the items:

**Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
- Agent 0: 492
- Agent 1: 499
- Agent 2: 389
- Agent 3: 460

**Allocate Items Based on Preferences:**

1. **Agent 1 Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Items 1 (91), 2 (87), 3 (89)
   - Assign items 1, 2, 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 3 Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Items 2 (91), 4 (88), 5 (74), 6 (88)
   - Assign items 4, 6 to Agent 3 (since 2 is already taken).

3. **Agent 0 Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Items 2 (77), 5 (71), 0 (70)
   - Assign items 0, 5 to Agent 0 (since 2 is already taken).

4. **Agent 2 Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Items 4 (65), 8 (73)
   - Assign items 7, 8 to Agent 2 (since 4 is already taken).

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent and tries to minimize envy by giving each agent some of their most valued items, given the constraints.
