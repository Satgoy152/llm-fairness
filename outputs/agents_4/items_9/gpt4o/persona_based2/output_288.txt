Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  46  27  61  39  89   5  42  23
1  50  17  22  82  94  76  35  31  63
2  12  55  96  25  16  78  23  67   8
3  56  70  16  34  29  51  68  64  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can use an approach that seeks to minimize envy among the agents. One common method is to use the "Envy-Free" allocation method, which ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations provided, we will attempt to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. Here, we aim to allocate all 9 items with the goal of minimizing envy.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [82, 46, 27, 61, 39, 89, 5, 42, 23]
- Agent 1: [50, 17, 22, 82, 94, 76, 35, 31, 63]
- Agent 2: [12, 55, 96, 25, 16, 78, 23, 67, 8]
- Agent 3: [56, 70, 16, 34, 29, 51, 68, 64, 71]

Using these valuations, we can try to assign items to agents such that the total value of items for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 5] (Total value: 171)
- Agent 1: [1, 4, 8] (Total value: 174)
- Agent 2: [2, 7] (Total value: 163)
- Agent 3: [3, 6] (Total value: 102)

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their own valuation of the items.
