Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79   9  29  58  54  29  41  10  29
1   7  59  70   7  87  19  74  48  28
2  60  89  39  61  39  73  53  73  45
3   1  50  12  29  34  11  52  51  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the concept of envy-freeness and try to maximize overall satisfaction. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Although achieving perfect envy-freeness is complex given the integer constraints, we can attempt to approximate it as best as possible.

One common method to approach fair division is to use a round-robin or a bidding-like procedure where agents pick items based on their highest valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Sort each agent's valuations for the items in descending order.
2. Sequentially allow each agent to pick their most valued available item.

Following this process:

1. **Agent 0** values items as follows: [0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 8, 7, 1]. Agent 0 picks item 0 first.
2. **Agent 1** values items as follows: [4, 2, 6, 7, 8, 1, 5, 0, 3]. Agent 1 picks item 4.
3. **Agent 2** values items as follows: [1, 7, 5, 0, 3, 6, 2, 8, 4]. Agent 2 picks item 1.
4. **Agent 3** values items as follows: [8, 1, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 0, 5]. Agent 3 picks item 8.

Continue the allocation by repeating the process for the remaining items:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 3.
2. **Agent 1** picks item 2.
3. **Agent 2** picks item 5.
4. **Agent 3** picks item 7.

Remaining items (6) are then picked by:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 6.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them their most valued items first.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [8, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item.
