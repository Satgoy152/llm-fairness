Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  28  59  65  18   6  46  67   2
1  33  67  72  61   9  18  71  77  50
2  75  39  23  18  90  66  59  60  30
3  33  83   8  24  99  67  25  53  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among agents, we can use an envy-free mechanism such as the adjusted winner procedure or the maximum Nash welfare solution. These methods aim to balance the utility among all agents. Given the valuations, we will aim to allocate the items to maximize fairness and minimize envy.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most, with a valuation of 65.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most, with a valuation of 77.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most, with a valuation of 90.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most, but since it is already assigned to agent 2, we look at the next highest, which is item 1, valued at 83.

We will proceed by allocating items to agents based on their next highest valued non-conflicting items.

Here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3 (value 65), 0 (value 33)
- Agent 1: Items 7 (value 77), 6 (value 71), 2 (value 72)
- Agent 2: Items 4 (value 90), 5 (value 66)
- Agent 3: Items 1 (value 83), 8 (value 50)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items while considering their highest valuation preferences, minimizing potential envy.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [7, 6, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 8]
}
```
