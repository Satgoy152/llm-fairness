Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  24   3  37  19  16  48   8   8
1  53  98  36  40  97  40  42  89  80
2  72  61  19  30  66  80  45  68   7
3  72  30  55  13  61  26  89  70  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, we'll attempt to distribute the items so that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to the others.

Here's how we can approach the problem:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: Look for items that have particularly high value for any given agent, and try to allocate those items to the respective agents to reduce envy.

2. **Balance Overall Value**: Ensure that the total value of items allocated to each agent is roughly balanced, which might require some trade-offs.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Since we have 9 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We must ensure that all 9 items are allocated.

Using these principles, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 highly, so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly, so we allocate item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly, but since agent 0 already has it and agent 3 also values item 6 highly, we make a trade-off by giving agent 3 item 6.

Continuing this process to ensure balance and completeness, here is one potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 8]
- **Agent 3**: Items [2, 3, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, with an attempt at balancing overall satisfaction. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
