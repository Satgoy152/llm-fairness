Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  73  28  98  45  59   8   9  60
1  25  90   7  25  85  14  71  93   9
2  84  47   9  12  30  27  74  43  17
3  36  64  49   8  41  66  54  92  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents while considering their valuations, we will aim for an allocation that is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's first examine the total valuations for each agent and try to balance the allocations according to their preferences:

1. **Agent 0's total valuation:**
   - 56 + 73 + 28 + 98 + 45 + 59 + 8 + 9 + 60 = 436

2. **Agent 1's total valuation:**
   - 25 + 90 + 7 + 25 + 85 + 14 + 71 + 93 + 9 = 419

3. **Agent 2's total valuation:**
   - 84 + 47 + 9 + 12 + 30 + 27 + 74 + 43 + 17 = 341

4. **Agent 3's total valuation:**
   - 36 + 64 + 49 + 8 + 41 + 66 + 54 + 92 + 89 = 499

Based on these valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items such that the division is as fair as possible. We will try to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** We can allocate items that agent 0 highly values, such as item 3 (98), item 1 (73), and item 8 (60). This gives agent 0 a total valuation of 231.
- **Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 1 (90) and item 7 (93) highly, so we allocate these two items to agent 1. This gives agent 1 a total valuation of 183.
- **Agent 2:** Agent 2 highly values item 0 (84) and item 6 (74), so we allocate these two items to agent 2. This gives agent 2 a total valuation of 158.
- **Agent 3:** We allocate the remaining items (2, 4, 5) to agent 3, who values item 5 (66) and item 4 (41) fairly well. This gives agent 3 a total valuation of 146.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 8],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the preferences of the agents as much as possible and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items.
