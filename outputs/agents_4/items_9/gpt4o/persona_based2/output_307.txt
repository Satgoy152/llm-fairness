Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  74  79  16  30   2  31  22  61
1  88  74  63  44  61  59  54  80  56
2  67  49   7  74  10  79  90  87  50
3  63  14  31  74  44  10  61  39  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the distribution minimizes envy between agents. One common method to achieve a fair division is by using the concept of "envy-freeness", where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. 

Let's consider the valuations and attempt to allocate the items in a way that is as fair as possible:

### Initial Observations:
1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (81).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 even higher (88).
3. Agent 2 has high valuation for item 6 (90).
4. Agent 3 values item 8 the most (96).

### Allocation Strategy:
We will try to allocate each agent at least one item they value highly, then distribute the remaining items to balance the overall allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (88). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 (74), which is already the second highest after item 0. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** highly values item 8 (96). Assign item 8 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 2** values item 6 the most (90). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

5. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 highly (79). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
6. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values item 3 highly (74). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
7. **Item 4**: Agent 1 has a relatively higher valuation (61). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
8. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values this item significantly (79). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
9. **Item 7**: Assign to Agent 3, aligning with a higher overall utility for Agent 3.

### Final Allocation:
1. Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
2. Agent 1: Items [0, 4]
3. Agent 2: Items [3, 5, 6]
4. Agent 3: Items [7, 8]

These allocations ensure that each agent receives at least one highly valued item, and the total number of allocated items is 9, satisfying the conditions of the problem.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 6],
    "3": [7, 8]
}
```
