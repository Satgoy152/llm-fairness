Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  15  55  83  96   2  47  81  76
1  97  11  67  28  96  28   6   4  74
2  35  72  79  69  20  84  84  76   1
3  91   8  79  37  41  28   1   3   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an allocation that is fair, we should consider principles like envy-freeness, which means no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. While it is challenging to achieve perfect envy-freeness with discrete items and varying valuations, a reasonable approach is to attempt maximizing each agent's satisfaction given the constraints.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0 (0):** Has a high valuation for item 4 and relatively high for items 3 and 8.
2. **Agent 1 (1):** Highly values items 0 and 4.
3. **Agent 2 (2):** Highly values items 2, 5, and 6.
4. **Agent 3 (3):** Values item 0 highly and also has moderate valuations for items 2 and 3.

After analyzing these preferences, a fair allocation might look like:

- **Agent 0 (0):** Items [3, 4] to maximize their higher valuations.
- **Agent 1 (1):** Items [0] because of the very high valuation.
- **Agent 2 (2):** Items [2, 5, 6] where they have high valuations.
- **Agent 3 (3):** Items [1, 7, 8] as they have relatively higher valuations for these items compared to others.

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent receives, considering their individual preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5, 6],
    "3": [1, 7, 8]
}
```
