Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  44  48  32  26  58  80  33  65
1  90  47  59  92  42  96  90  88  80
2  56   2  31  85  42   1  24  82  86
3  59  58  18  80  33  65  49  44  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the "envy-free" criterion, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their own share.

Let's examine the values of each item for each agent and attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valued items in descending order are: 6 (80), 5 (58), 2 (48), 1 (44), 8 (65), etc.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valued items in descending order are: 5 (96), 3 (92), 0 (90), 6 (90), 8 (80), etc.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valued items in descending order are: 8 (86), 3 (85), 0 (56), 7 (82), 2 (31), etc.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valued items in descending order are: 3 (80), 0 (59), 1 (58), 5 (65), 7 (44), etc.

We aim to allocate the items such that no agent envies another's allocation:

- **Agent 1** should receive item 5 because it is their highest valued item, with a valuation of 96.
- **Agent 2** should receive item 8, as it is their highest valued item with a valuation of 86.
- **Agent 0** should receive item 6, as it is their highest valued item, with a valuation of 80.
- **Agent 3** should receive item 3, as it is their highest valued item, with a valuation of 80.

Now let's allocate the remaining items considering the next highest valuations:

- **Agent 1** also values item 3 highly, but since it's already allocated, we move to item 0, which they value at 90.
- **Agent 2** values item 7 at 82, so they should receive it.
- **Agent 0** values item 8 but since it's taken, the next is item 5, which is already taken, so we move to item 2, which they value at 48.
- **Agent 3** values item 0, which is already taken, so we move to item 1, which they value at 58.

Finally, distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** should also receive item 1, valued at 44.
- **Agent 2** should receive item 4, valued at 42.

Thus, we have a fair allocation of items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 1],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [8, 7, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated, respecting their preferences as much as possible.
