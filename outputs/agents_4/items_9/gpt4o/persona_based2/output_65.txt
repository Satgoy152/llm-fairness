Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  25  56  95   5   2  23  27  69
1  43   7  87  37  55  10  28  94  94
2  94  15  87  84  94  32  10  41  26
3  18  32  45  59  85   7  71  95  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if each agent believes that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuation.

Here, we will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their share, given the constraint of integer allocations. 

Let's consider each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0: Sum of valuations = 12 + 25 + 56 + 95 + 5 + 2 + 23 + 27 + 69 = 314
- Agent 1: Sum of valuations = 43 + 7 + 87 + 37 + 55 + 10 + 28 + 94 + 94 = 455
- Agent 2: Sum of valuations = 94 + 15 + 87 + 84 + 94 + 32 + 10 + 41 + 26 = 483
- Agent 3: Sum of valuations = 18 + 32 + 45 + 59 + 85 + 7 + 71 + 95 + 55 = 467

Given these total valuations, we can make an allocation that attempts to balance the envy-freeness:

1. Agent 2 has the highest valuation, so we should prioritize giving them items they value highly and can secure a larger share.
2. Agent 1 also has a high valuation, so they should receive items they value highly as well.
3. Agents 0 and 3 have lower total valuations, so they could receive fewer items or items that are less valued by others.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [5, 2] (valuations: 2, 56)
- Agent 1: [8, 1, 4] (valuations: 94, 7, 55)
- Agent 2: [0, 3, 6] (valuations: 94, 84, 10)
- Agent 3: [7] (valuations: 95)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, while attempting to balance the total value each agent perceives.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [8, 1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3, 6],
    "3": [7]
}
```
