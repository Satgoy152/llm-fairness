Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  75  99  18  17  52  28  13  81
1  25  49  97  65  36  17  79  33  60
2  87  39  69  36  50  97   1  48  53
3  31  82  83  60  44  39  27  52  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can use a strategy such as the Envy-Free allocation. This strategy seeks to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy, where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

We have 4 agents and 9 items. Each agent should get approximately 2 items, and one agent will get an additional item to ensure all 9 items are allocated.

Here's a potential allocation strategy based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. **Agent 0**: Total value for items [0, 1, 2] is 252. Items [0, 1] have high values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Total value for items [3, 4, 6] is 180. Items 6 and 3 have good values for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Total value for items [5, 7, 8] is 198. Items 5 and 8 have high values for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Total value for items [2] is 83. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 3.

We will allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]
- Agent 2: [5, 8]
- Agent 3: [2, 6, 7]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their preferences and aims to maintain a fair division.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation respects the requirement that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
