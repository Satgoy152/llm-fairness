Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66   3  86  31  27  31  79  49   0
1  45  49  92  95  16  49  37  65   4
2  55  30  46  16  44  54  14  64  15
3  33  39   0  93  18   3  70  85  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and possibly achieves envy-freeness, given the valuations provided by the agents. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:** Compute the total value that each agent assigns to all items combined.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their total valuation.

3. **Check for Envy:** Adjust allocations if necessary to minimize envy. This might involve swapping items between agents.

4. **Fair Sharing:** Ensure that each agent receives a number of items close to the average, which is 9 items total divided by 4 agents, or about 2.25 items per agent. Since each agent must receive an integer number of items, some agents will receive 2 items, and others will receive 3 items.

**Valuations:**

- Agent 0: [66, 3, 86, 31, 27, 31, 79, 49, 0]
- Agent 1: [45, 49, 92, 95, 16, 49, 37, 65, 4]
- Agent 2: [55, 30, 46, 16, 44, 54, 14, 64, 15]
- Agent 3: [33, 39, 0, 93, 18, 3, 70, 85, 42]

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

1. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0
   - Item 1: Agent 3
   - Item 2: Agent 1
   - Item 3: Agent 3
   - Item 4: Agent 2
   - Item 5: Agent 2
   - Item 6: Agent 0
   - Item 7: Agent 3
   - Item 8: Agent 3

2. **Adjust for Fair Distribution:**
   - Agent 3 has 4 items, while others have fewer. We will make adjustments.

3. **Adjustment:**
   - Move item 4 from Agent 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values item 4 more compared to Agent 2's other items).
   - Move item 8 from Agent 3 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values item 8 more compared to Agent 3's other items).

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [5, 8]
- Agent 3: [1, 3, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent ends up with either 2 or 3 items, minimizing overall envy. 

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
