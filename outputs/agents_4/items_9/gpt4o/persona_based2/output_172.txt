Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3   5  88  58  71  55  90   2  48
1  31  22  95  94  50  75  72  79  99
2  84  19  88   4  53  43  97   5  98
3  54  46   7  49  89  93  14  87  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To create a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-free distribution as much as possible. In practice, achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, but we can strive to minimize envy by ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 3 + 5 + 88 + 58 + 71 + 55 + 90 + 2 + 48 = 420
- Agent 1: 31 + 22 + 95 + 94 + 50 + 75 + 72 + 79 + 99 = 617
- Agent 2: 84 + 19 + 88 + 4 + 53 + 43 + 97 + 5 + 98 = 491
- Agent 3: 54 + 46 + 7 + 49 + 89 + 93 + 14 + 87 + 56 = 495

Now, let's attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items proportional to their total valuation. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, ideally, each agent should get about 2-3 items. Let's allocate items based on maximizing each agent's value for specific items while maintaining an overall balance.

### Allocation Plan

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values for items 6, 2
   - Allocate items: [6, 2]

2. **Agent 1**: Highest values for items 8, 3, 2
   - Allocate items: [8, 3]

3. **Agent 2**: Highest values for items 8, 6, 2
   - Allocate items: [5, 0]

4. **Agent 3**: Highest values for items 5, 4, 7
   - Allocate items: [1, 4, 7]

### Final Allocation

By ensuring each agent receives a portion of items that maximizes their individual values, we aim to reduce envy. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [8, 3],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [1, 4, 7]
}
```
