Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  69  97  90  41  72  18  22   3
1  86  41  86  33  70  40  64  87  67
2  71  53  74  89  33   5  66  46  71
3  25   2  44  47  64  80  31  17  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations provided, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if each agent receives a fair share:

1. First, determine the total valuation for all items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 73 + 69 + 97 + 90 + 41 + 72 + 18 + 22 + 3 = 485
   - Agent 1: 86 + 41 + 86 + 33 + 70 + 40 + 64 + 87 + 67 = 574
   - Agent 2: 71 + 53 + 74 + 89 + 33 + 5 + 66 + 46 + 71 = 508
   - Agent 3: 25 + 2 + 44 + 47 + 64 + 80 + 31 + 17 + 24 = 334

2. The total value of all items is 485 + 574 + 508 + 334 = 1901.
3. Each agent should ideally receive around 1901 / 4 = 475.25 in value, but since we need integer item allocations, we will aim for allocations close to this value.

Now, let's allocate items based on maximizing each agent's value:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 3, 1. Assign these items: [2, 3, 1].
- Agent 1 values item 7 highly. Assign item 7 and the next highest valuation items: [7, 4].
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly, but it's already allocated to Agent 0. Assign next highest valued items: [6, 8].
- Agent 3 has remaining items. Assign remaining items: [5, 0].

Let's check the values for each allocation:
- Agent 0: 97 (item 2) + 90 (item 3) + 69 (item 1) = 256
- Agent 1: 87 (item 7) + 70 (item 4) = 157
- Agent 2: 66 (item 6) + 71 (item 8) = 137
- Agent 3: 80 (item 5) + 25 (item 0) = 105

Now, we present the allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 1],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonably fair share of the total value based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
