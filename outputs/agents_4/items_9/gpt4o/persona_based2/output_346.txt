Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  22  72  23  93  78  71  82  37
1  39  26  72  44  99  67  78  49  87
2  89  76  70  93  44   0  90  26  64
3  85  36  14  49  59  64  54  52  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, it's important to assess the valuations and distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Determine the total value each agent assigns to all the items to gauge their overall valuation perspective.

2. **Determine an Envy-Free Allocation**: An allocation is envy-free if every agent believes they received at least as much value as any other agent. Given the discrete nature of this problem, we aim for a solution that minimizes potential envy.

3. **Use a Greedy Approach with Adjustments**: Start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, then adjust to ensure each agent receives a fair number of items.

4. **Iterate and Adjust**: Since we have 9 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally get about 2 to 3 items. Use iterations to refine the allocation to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with this plan to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations**:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (Value: 89)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (Value: 76)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (Value: 72)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (Value: 93)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (Value: 99)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (Value: 78)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 (Value: 90)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (Value: 82)
   - Item 8: Agent 1 (Value: 87)

2. **Adjust for Fairness**: Check and adjust to ensure each agent receives a reasonable number of items and minimize envy.

3. **Final Allocation**:
    - Agent 0: [2, 5, 7]
    - Agent 1: [4, 8]
    - Agent 2: [0, 1, 6]
    - Agent 3: [3]

This allocation ensures that each agent has received a share of the items, and the distribution aims to minimize envy by considering individual valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 7],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 6],
    "3": [3]
}
```
