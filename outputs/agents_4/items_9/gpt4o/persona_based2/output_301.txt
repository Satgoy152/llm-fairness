Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  95  27  86  87  37  88  96  28
1  93  92  45  39  83  15  12  70  71
2  97  64  23   7  11  87  61   6  80
3  73  15  16  65  79  35  84  84  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we want to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly and that the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

To achieve this, we can use an approximation method to balance each agent's total valuation of their allocated items. We'll aim to distribute the total value of items in such a way that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their own allocation compared to others.

Given the valuations, we can start by considering the highest-valued items for each agent and attempt to distribute them to balance the overall satisfaction. Here's how the allocation process might look:

1. **Identify High Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items 7 and 1 highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 highly.
   - Agent 3 values items 4 and 6 highly.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Preferences:**
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 0 as it has a high value (96).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1 (value 93) and agent 2 (value 97). Here, we need to decide based on a tie-breaker, such as max total value allocation strategy.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 3 (value 79).
   
3. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance:**
   - Since agent 0 has item 7, we can balance the allocation by giving them item 1 (95).
   - Agent 1 could receive item 8 (71).
   - Agent 2 could receive item 5 (87).
   - Agent 3 could receive item 6 (84).
   - Distribute remaining items to equalize valuation scores:
     - Give item 2 to agent 0.
     - Give item 3 to agent 3.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - Ensure each agent receives an approximate equal share of total value by potentially swapping items between agents to minimize envy.

After running through this allocation logic, here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by distributing high-value items and balancing the total values each agent receives. Each agent has been allocated at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated in total.
