Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  88  99  64  20  17  93  32  47
1  55  65   7  74  47  57  96  38  98
2  35  74  40  32  40  61  43  31  15
3  40  18  96  86  84  43  91  86   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" approach. This method involves giving each agent a chance to choose an item based on their preferences in a rotating manner until all items are allocated. 

Given the valuations table, each agent will prioritize the items with the highest valuation to them. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Picks item 2 (value 99).
2. **Agent 1**: Picks item 8 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2**: Picks item 5 (value 61).
4. **Agent 3**: Picks item 2 (value 96, but already taken), so picks item 3 (value 86).
5. **Agent 0**: Picks item 6 (value 93).
6. **Agent 1**: Picks item 6 (value 96, but already taken), so picks item 3 (value 74, but already taken), so picks item 0 (value 55).
7. **Agent 2**: Picks item 1 (value 74).
8. **Agent 3**: Picks item 0 (value 40, but already taken), so picks item 6 (value 91, but already taken), so picks item 7 (value 86).
9. **Agent 0**: Picks item 3 (value 64, but already taken), so picks item 1 (value 88, but already taken), so picks item 0 (value 34, but already taken), so picks item 7 (value 32, but already taken), so picks item 4 (value 20).

Now let's confirm the allocation and format it in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 4],
    "1": [8, 0],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair distribution of items based on their valuations, while also ensuring that all 9 items are allocated.
