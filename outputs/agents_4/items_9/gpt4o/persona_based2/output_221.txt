Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  22  73  61  25  39  97  38  91
1  49  48  93  76  32  85  78  85  65
2  36   4  68  18  57  27  40  42  63
3  99  37  33   4  36  77  38  23  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, I will first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and then attempt to allocate them in a manner that minimizes envy. The goal is to ensure each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their individual valuations.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 477
- Agent 1: 611
- Agent 2: 355
- Agent 3: 376

Given these total valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a proportionate share of their perceived total value.

Here is a possible allocation of the items to ensure a fair division:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 2, 5 (Valuation: 31 + 73 + 39 = 143)
- Agent 1:
  - Items: 3, 7 (Valuation: 76 + 85 = 161)
- Agent 2:
  - Items: 4, 8 (Valuation: 57 + 63 = 120)
- Agent 3:
  - Items: 1, 6 (Valuation: 37 + 38 = 75)

Each agent receives 2 or 3 items, ensuring that all 9 items are allocated. The allocations are constructed to ensure that each agent receives a subset of items that they perceive as valuable, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and that each agent receives at least one item they value significantly, thus aiming to achieve a fair division.
