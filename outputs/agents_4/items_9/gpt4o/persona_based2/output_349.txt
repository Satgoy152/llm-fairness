Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  76  98  90  90  45  61  66  73
1  70  76  65  13  79  78  26  90  13
2  72  96  55  13   7  99  18   4  22
3  91  77  17  57  31  68  44   8  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. A common approach in such problems is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or considering the Nash bargaining solution. Here, I'll provide an allocation using a simple heuristic approach:

1. **Step 1**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items. This helps us understand the relative preference and potential "happiness" of each agent if they were to receive all items.

2. **Step 2**: Sort the items based on their valuations for each agent. This will help us understand which items are more valuable to each agent.

3. **Step 3**: Allocate items to agents one by one, trying to balance the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least two items since there are 9 items and 4 agents.

### Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 613
- Agent 1: 510
- Agent 2: 386
- Agent 3: 430

### Sorted Preferences:
- Agent 0: [2, 3, 4, 8, 1, 7, 6, 5, 0]
- Agent 1: [1, 4, 5, 7, 0, 2, 6, 3, 8]
- Agent 2: [5, 1, 0, 2, 8, 6, 3, 7, 4]
- Agent 3: [0, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4, 8, 2, 7]

### Allocation:
- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [5, 8]
- Agent 3: [0, 6, 7]

The above allocation ensures each agent gets at least two items, and the items are fairly distributed based on the agent's preferences, minimizing envy to the extent possible with the given valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [0, 6, 7]
}
```
