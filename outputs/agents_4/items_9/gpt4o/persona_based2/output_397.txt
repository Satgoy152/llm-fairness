Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  74  32  46  24  67  11  59  62
1  13  29  46  13   6  36  75  41  73
2  89  50   2  28  84  81  93  71  91
3  35  76  25  25  40  21  30  64  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [35 76 25 25 40 21 30 64 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy or achieves fairness criteria such as envy-freeness, proportionality, or equitability. 

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [45, 74, 32, 46, 24, 67, 11, 59, 62]
Agent 1: [13, 29, 46, 13,  6, 36, 75, 41, 73]
Agent 2: [89, 50,  2, 28, 84, 81, 93, 71, 91]
Agent 3: [35, 76, 25, 25, 40, 21, 30, 64, 77]
```

One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns the most valued item to the agent who values it most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 2** values item 6 at 93, the highest single valuation, so assign item 6 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 2** values item 0 at 89, the next highest, so assign item 0 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 2** values item 8 at 91, so assign item 8 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 2** values item 4 at 84, so assign item 4 to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 3** values item 1 at 76, the next highest, so assign item 1 to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 0** values item 5 at 67, so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 0** values item 3 at 46, so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 1** values item 7 at 41, so assign item 7 to Agent 1.
9. **Agent 3** values item 2 at 25, so assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now each agent has received some items and we have allocated all 9 items. Let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 4, 6, 8],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This distribution attempts to respect the highest valuations and ensures that items are distributed in a manner that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
