Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  66  22  93  28   3  54  28  96
1  71  76  12  95  66   0  61  11  28
2   7  75  22  58  92  25  73  45  38
3  56  69  64   7  87  28  59  34  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the problem of fairly allocating the items among the agents, we need to consider methods that ensure fairness, such as envy-freeness or maximizing total valuations. Given the valuation matrix, we can attempt to allocate items to agents such that envy is minimized and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Matches**: Start by identifying which items are most highly valued by each agent.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

3. **Balanced Distribution**: Adjust the allocations to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

4. **Final Adjustments**: Review to ensure no agent envies another significantly, and refine allocations to balance the distribution.

Using this approach, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 8 highly (96) and item 3 (93) next.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly (95) and item 1 next (76).
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly (92) and item 6 next (73).
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly (87) but also values item 1 and item 6.

By distributing items based on these insights and refining, we get:

- Agent 0: [0, 8]
- Agent 1: [3, 1]
- Agent 2: [4, 6]
- Agent 3: [2, 5, 7]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and all 9 items are distributed.
