Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  79  59  13  12   1  27  77  38
1  87  27  81  37  55  60  87  73  95
2  33  39  83  46  90  80  36  89  87
3  98  19  53  77  11  53  86  22  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This can be challenging, but we can attempt to reach a reasonable distribution.

Here is a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest.
   - Agent 1 values item 8 the highest.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest.
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Allocate each agent their highest-valued item first, ensuring that no two agents get the same item.

3. **Remaining Items and Further Allocation:**
   - After the highest value allocation, some items remain unallocated.
   - Allocate these items to agents by considering their next highest valuations and ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Following this method, we allocate the remaining items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and no item is left unallocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on the above analysis:

- **Agent 0:** Start with item 1. Next highest valuation is item 7.
- **Agent 1:** Start with item 8. Next highest valuation is item 6.
- **Agent 2:** Start with item 4. Next highest valuation is item 2.
- **Agent 3:** Start with item 0. Next highest valuation is item 3.

After these allocations, we have the following items left: 5. We will allocate it to the agent who values it the highest among those who have received the fewest items, ensuring a balanced distribution.

Let's summarize the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [8, 6],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences while distributing the items evenly and ensuring no item is left unallocated.
