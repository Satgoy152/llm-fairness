Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  38  68  50  97  39  13  89  16
1  75  30  42  15  98  24  29  95  84
2  45  91  34  39  82  42   3   5  45
3  48   2  32  73  63  59  69  48  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that strives to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives a share of the items proportional to their valuations. Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  38  68  50  97  39  13  89  16
1  75  30  42  15  98  24  29  95  84
2  45  91  34  39  82  42   3   5  45
3  48   2  32  73  63  59  69  48  68
```

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "maximum marginal utility" method, which involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least some items.

Let's begin the allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it the most with 87.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 2 values it the most with 91.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it the most with 68.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 3 values it the most with 73.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it the most with 98.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 3 values it the most with 59.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 3 values it the most with 69.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 1 values it the most with 95.
9. **Item 8:** Agent 1 values it the most with 84.

Now let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and redistribute if necessary:

- Agent 0 has items [0, 2].
- Agent 1 has items [4, 7, 8].
- Agent 2 has item [1].
- Agent 3 has items [3, 5, 6].

This allocation gives each agent some items and aims to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations. The final distribution of items is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 7, 8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
