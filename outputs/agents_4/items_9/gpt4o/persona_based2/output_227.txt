Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  76  88  58  79  98  23   4  32
1  59  81  53  46  76  24  96  60  97
2   9  50  78  22  25  94  49  22  34
3  36  16  73  12  65  80  89  86  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, which means each agent should prefer their own allocation over others. Here, we can use a heuristic approach to achieve a fair division by considering the agents' valuations and attempting to balance them out.

Let's follow a simple approach to allocate items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation Per Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 499
   - Agent 1: 592
   - Agent 2: 383
   - Agent 3: 494

   Each agent views the total value of all items differently. We will aim to distribute items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - We will allocate items one by one, giving each agent the item that maximizes their satisfaction (relative to other unallocated items) until all items are allocated.

3. **Assignment:**
   - Assign items sequentially, considering the highest remaining value for each agent and ensuring that all agents receive some items.

Following this approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Given the highest valuation for items 5, 2, and 4, we allocate these to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Highest valuations for items 8, 0, and 1, allocate these to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Allocate the next highest remaining valued items, 6 and 3, to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Allocate the remaining item, 7, to Agent 3.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 4],
    "1": [1, 0, 8],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the total number of allocated items is 9. Each agent receives items that they value relatively highly compared to the remaining unallocated items during the allocation process.
