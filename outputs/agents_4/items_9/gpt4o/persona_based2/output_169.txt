Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  45  38  89  34  35  41  63  25
1  78  61  98  60  30  78  62  89  88
2  78  21  98  73  38  95  15  78  85
3  87  84  60  61  26  82  32  71  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that no agent envies another based on the total valuation they receive. This may not always be perfectly possible, especially with integer allocations, but we can aim to minimize envy.

Here's an attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values the items at relatively lower valuations compared to some others. So, we should focus on allocating items to them that are least likely to cause envy from others.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 highly (98) and could be a good candidate for this item. Several other items are also highly valued by this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent also values item 2 highly, but we need to balance with other items since item 2 might already be allocated.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has a relatively higher and more uniform valuation across several items.

We will attempt to allocate items in a way that each agent receives a fair share of their total maximum valuation. Here's one way to allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items that maximize their valuation without causing significant envy from others. Suggested items: 0, 1, 4
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 2 and 5, since agent 1 values item 2 highly and item 5 is also highly valued.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 3 and 6, balancing the allocation with other items of value to this agent.
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 7 and 8, as these items have relatively high values for this agent.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and minimize potential envy by considering the unique preferences each agent has for the items.
