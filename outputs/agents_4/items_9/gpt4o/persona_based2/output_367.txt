Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44   3  66  66  91  34  71  91  33
1  16  19  51  28  38  15  37  67  23
2  99  94  64   9  27  85  97  19  44
3  67  68  68  25  13  36  61  11  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim for a distribution that minimizes envy while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We consider each agent's valuation of the items to optimize the allocation process.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: High valuations for items 4 (91), 7 (91), 2 (66), 3 (66)
- Agent 1: High valuations for items 7 (67), 2 (51), 4 (38)
- Agent 2: High valuations for items 0 (99), 6 (97), 1 (94)
- Agent 3: High valuations for items 1 (68), 2 (68), 0 (67), 8 (66)

We aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations, while ensuring no agent receives more than three items and all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0**: Can be allocated items 4, 7, and 2 due to high valuations.
2. **Agent 1**: Can receive item 3, and item 8 (although not the highest, it's fairly valued).
3. **Agent 2**: Can be allocated items 0 and 6 because of the very high valuation.
4. **Agent 3**: Can receive items 1 and 5, which are reasonably valued.

This allocation considers both high valuations and a fair distribution of items, ensuring each agent receives a reasonable number of items based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 2],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and aims to minimize envy by allocating the items each agent values most.
