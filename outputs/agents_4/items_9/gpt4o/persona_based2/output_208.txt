Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40   8  69   3  21  72  95  43  36
1  10  64  91  12  98  74   0  26  88
2  85  30  88  20  77  36  34   2  59
3  93  88  89  60  99  90  45  64  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we'll employ a method to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations. The goal is to allocate the items in a way that maximizes fairness, taking into account each agent's preferences.

Here's a step-by-step outline of the allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: We start by identifying which items are highly valued by each agent. This helps us understand the preferences and potential envy points among the agents.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign the items to agents who have the highest valuation for those items. This helps in reducing potential envy.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: After the initial allocation, adjust assignments to ensure each agent receives a fair share of the total value, as evenly as possible.

4. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: Verify that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Now, let's assign the items based on the valuations given:

- Agent 0 seems to highly value items 6 (95) and 5 (72).
- Agent 1 values items 4 (98) and 2 (91).
- Agent 2 values item 0 (85) and 2 (88).
- Agent 3 values item 4 (99), 3 (60), and 0 (93).

Allocating the items with these preferences in mind:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items [6, 5] for a total value of 167 (95 + 72).
- **Agent 1**: Gets items [4, 2] for a total value of 189 (98 + 91).
- **Agent 2**: Gets items [0, 8] for a total value of 144 (85 + 59).
- **Agent 3**: Gets items [3, 1, 7] for a total value of 212 (60 + 88 + 64).

This allocation is designed to balance the total value received by each agent while respecting their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [3, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to be fair and envy-free given the constraints and preferences indicated by the valuations.
