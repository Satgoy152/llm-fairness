Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  31  88  59  73  35  83  13   8
1  26  86  42  78  84  34  23  95  79
2  81  31  15  97  77   2  99  41  17
3   9  98  42  80  78  70  86   2  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method called "round-robin" allocation or "maximum marginal utility." This method involves distributing the items in a way that maximizes each agent's utility with each allocation step.

Let's calculate the allocations:

1. **Initial Setup**: Each agent evaluates each item differently, and our goal is to make sure every agent gets items such that they do not envy another agent's bundle.

2. **Round-robin Process**:
   - Start by sorting items based on maximum valuation across all agents and allocate iteratively.
   - During each iteration, assign the item to the agent who values it the most among those who have not received an item yet in that round.

3. **Item-by-item Allocation**:
   - **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (81). Assign to Agent 2.
   - **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (98). Assign to Agent 3.
   - **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (88). Assign to Agent 0.
   - **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (97). Assign to Agent 2.
   - **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (84). Assign to Agent 1.
   - **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (70). Assign to Agent 3.
   - **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (99). Assign to Agent 2.
   - **Item 7**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (95). Assign to Agent 1.
   - **Item 8**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (79). Assign to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [2]
   - Agent 1: [4, 7, 8]
   - Agent 2: [0, 3, 6]
   - Agent 3: [1, 5]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 7, 8],
    "2": [0, 3, 6],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and the process attempts to minimize envy by allocating items based on the highest individual valuations in each step.
