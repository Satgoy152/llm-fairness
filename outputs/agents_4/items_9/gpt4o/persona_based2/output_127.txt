Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  93  54  94  23   9  22  83  14
1  46  36  54  34  12  28  46  54  50
2  69   4  71   0  84  16  96  32   5
3  89  80  29  64  31   7  53  68  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own. To achieve this, we will try to assign items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is balanced, while ensuring that every item is distributed.

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We have 4 agents and 9 items.
   - Each agent should ideally receive around 2 items, with one agent possibly receiving 3 to account for all 9 items.

2. **Valuation Matrix:**
   - Agent 0: [60, 93, 54, 94, 23, 9, 22, 83, 14]
   - Agent 1: [46, 36, 54, 34, 12, 28, 46, 54, 50]
   - Agent 2: [69, 4, 71, 0, 84, 16, 96, 32, 5]
   - Agent 3: [89, 80, 29, 64, 31, 7, 53, 68, 99]

3. **Assign Items:**
   - **Agent 0:** Given their high valuation for items 1 and 3, assign these to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 1:** Assign items 2 and 8, which have higher valuations for Agent 1 compared to others.
   - **Agent 2:** Assign items 4 and 6, where Agent 2 has a strong preference.
   - **Agent 3:** Assign items 0, 5, and 7, ensuring that Agent 3's high preference items are included.

4. **Check Balance:**
   - Each agent receives an allocation such that their individual valuation is maximized relative to others, aiming for as close an envy-free distribution as possible.

5. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent, ensuring no agent has a strong preference for another's allocation, while also distributing all items.
