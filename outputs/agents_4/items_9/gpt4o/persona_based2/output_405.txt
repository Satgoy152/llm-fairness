Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  86  10  45  66  50  37  40  13
1  37   0  10  69  79  50  57  80  65
2  49  86  73  11  73  36  58  38  55
3  26  62  45  18  59  41  83  55  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent receives an integer number of items, we'll aim to minimize envy among agents, i.e., each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. Given the constraints and the valuation table, we'll work through a possible allocation.

First, we notice there are 9 items and 4 agents. Each agent should ideally receive around \( \frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \) items, which suggests a distribution of 2 or 3 items per agent. 

Let's consider the valuations and attempt to distribute the items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (86), 4 (66)
   - Allocate items [1, 4]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items not already allocated: 7 (80), 4 (79)
   - Item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we consider next highest available: 3 (69)
   - Allocate items [3, 7]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items not already allocated: 0 (49), 6 (58)
   - Allocate items [0, 6]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Remaining items: 2, 5, 8
   - Allocate these items [2, 5, 8] to Agent 3

Now, let's verify that all items are allocated and that we have 9 items total:

- Agent 0: [1, 4] (2 items)
- Agent 1: [3, 7] (2 items)
- Agent 2: [0, 6] (2 items)
- Agent 3: [2, 5, 8] (3 items)

This allocation satisfies the condition of integer distribution and utilizes all 9 items. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the items based on the agents' preferences while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.
