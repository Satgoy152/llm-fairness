Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  84  82  28  73  60  71  41  14
1  72  75  84  88  69  28  97  33  18
2  79   8   2  71   6  31  95  74  79
3  36  50  50  67  12  33  25  29  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To approach the problem of fairly allocating the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

First, we'll analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values items 1 and 2 highly.
- **Agent 1** values item 6 the most, followed by item 3.
- **Agent 2** values item 6 highly, with item 0 and 8 also valued.
- **Agent 3** values item 8 the most.

A possible strategy to achieve a fair allocation involves prioritizing the highest-valued items for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items 1 and 2. These are among the highest values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 3 and 6. Item 6 is the highest-valued for Agent 1, and item 3 is also highly valued.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 0 and 8. Item 8 is highly valued by Agent 3 as well, but Agent 2 also values it considerably and they have a good valuation for item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items 4, 5, and 7. These items have reasonable valuations for Agent 3 compared to the other options.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable portion of items according to their preferences, and we have allocated all 9 items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [4, 5, 7]
}
```
