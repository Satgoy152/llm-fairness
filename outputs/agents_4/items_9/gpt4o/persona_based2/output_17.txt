Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  58   1  64  65   2  18  42  62
1  62  61  84  11  79  54  34  57  81
2  40  39  24  93  17   0  90  87  57
3  96  29  37   1  40  14  42  66  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a method that attempts to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuations and distributing the items in such a way that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their individual utility given their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [10, 58, 1, 64, 65, 2, 18, 42, 62]
Agent 1: [62, 61, 84, 11, 79, 54, 34, 57, 81]
Agent 2: [40, 39, 24, 93, 17, 0, 90, 87, 57]
Agent 3: [96, 29, 37, 1, 40, 14, 42, 66, 81]
```

A balanced approach is to assign items such that each agent's total valuation is as equal as possible. This can help minimize envy. Let's allocate items one by one, trying to make sure the valuation totals are balanced:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 0 (96), so assign item 0 to agent 3.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 (84), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 3 (93), so assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 0** has a relatively high valuation for item 4 (65), so assign item 4 to agent 0.
5. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6 (90), so assign item 6 to agent 2.
6. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 7 (66), so assign item 7 to agent 3.
7. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 8 (81), so assign item 8 to agent 1.
8. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 (58), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
9. **Agent 3** has a higher valuation for item 5 (14) compared to others, so assign item 5 to agent 3.

Now, let's look at the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 8
- Agent 2: Items 3, 6
- Agent 3: Items 0, 5, 7

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, thus minimizing envy among the agents. Let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0, 5, 7]
}
```

This is the final allocation of items to agents.
