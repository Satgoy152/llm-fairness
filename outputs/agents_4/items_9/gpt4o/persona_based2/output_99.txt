Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  68  20  31  68  58  32  95  59
1  59  20  21  65   6  99  75  28  70
2  60   9  53  94   3  85  68  86  73
3  17  65  24  18  43  93  20  89  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations.

One approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where each agent takes turns selecting their most valued item that is still available. This method tends to lead to a fairer distribution, especially when there are a limited number of items and we want to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items using a round-robin approach based on the highest value each agent assigns to the remaining available items:

1. First round of picks:
   - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value: 95)
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value: 99)
   - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value: 94)
   - Agent 3 picks item 5 (value: 93) — already taken, so next best is item 7 (value: 89) — already taken, so next best is item 1 (value: 65)

2. Second round of picks:
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value: 68)
   - Agent 1 picks item 8 (value: 70)
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value: 85)
   - Agent 3 picks item 6 (value: 20)

3. Third round of picks:
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value: 68) — already taken, next best is item 0 (value: 65)
   - Agent 1 picks item 6 (value: 75) — already taken, next best is item 6 (value: 75) — already taken, next best is item 2 (value: 21)
   - Agent 2 picks item 8 (value: 73) — already taken, next best is item 6 (value: 68) — already taken, next best is item 0 (value: 60)
   - Agent 3 picks item 2 (value: 24)

Now, let's check if all items are allocated. We have allocated 9 items, but let's ensure the allocations are final:

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [7, 4, 0]
- Agent 1: [5, 8, 3]
- Agent 2: [3, 5, 2]
- Agent 3: [1, 6]

Upon reviewing the allocations, there are some overlaps. Adjust the allocations to ensure 9 unique items are distributed:

Final adjusted allocations:
- Agent 0: [7, 4, 0]
- Agent 1: [5, 8]
- Agent 2: [3, 2]
- Agent 3: [1, 6]

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4, 0],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
