Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  23  88  14  97  28  44  85   9
1  52  95  15  64  46  64  71  15  96
2   0  26  35  10  89  92  46  65  76
3   9  40  75  71  14  77  53  17  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible, ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations provided, we can use an algorithmic approach to approximate this goal. However, it's important to note that envy-freeness might not be perfectly achievable, but we will strive for a balanced allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Highest valuations: Item 4 (97), Item 2 (88), Item 0 (77)

Agent 1:
- Highest valuations: Item 1 (95), Item 8 (96), Item 6 (71)

Agent 2:
- Highest valuations: Item 5 (92), Item 4 (89), Item 8 (76)

Agent 3:
- Highest valuations: Item 5 (77), Item 3 (71), Item 2 (75)

Now, let's allocate the items with the goal of maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least some valuable items:

1. **Agent 0**: Given high valuations for Item 4 and Item 2, let's allocate these to Agent 0. Additionally, we can give Item 0.
   - Items: [4, 2, 0]

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values Item 1 and Item 8. Let's allocate these to Agent 1.
   - Items: [1, 8]

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values Item 5 and Item 8, but since Item 8 is already allocated, we give Item 5. To balance, allocate Item 6.
   - Items: [5, 6]

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values Item 3 and Item 2, but Item 2 is already allocated, so allocate Item 3. Allocate the remaining items to Agent 3.
   - Items: [3, 7]

With this, we ensure that all items are allocated, and we aim to achieve a balanced distribution based on the agents' preferences.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 0],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy the agents by maximizing their most valued items under the constraint of distributing all items.
