Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  17  62  77  74  40  54   0  82
1  64  95  51  70  22  89  60  33  77
2  84  54  25  30  90  70  72  85  34
3  46  90  48   5  66  81  64  73  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the fair division problem, we aim to allocate items to agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we can use a simple approach to achieve an equitable distribution by maximizing the total valuation each agent receives.

The valuation table is:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  17  62  77  74  40  54   0  82
1  64  95  51  70  22  89  60  33  77
2  84  54  25  30  90  70  72  85  34
3  46  90  48   5  66  81  64  73  31
```

To proceed with the allocation, we follow these steps:
1. Evaluate each item's highest valuation and allocate it to the respective agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least two items, as there are four agents and nine items, making it necessary to have one agent with only one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most (84).
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most (95).
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (62).
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (77).
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most (90).
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (89).
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most (72).
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most (85).
- **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it the most (82).

However, to ensure every agent receives at least one item, we need to adjust the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3, 8
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 5
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 4, 7
- **Agent 3**: Item 6

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing the total items fairly. The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 8],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 4, 7],
    "3": [6]
}
```
