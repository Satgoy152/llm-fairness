Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  92  53  34  51  96  82   5  57
1  79  82  55  96  34  55  82   9  87
2  12  23  26  28  75  47  84   0  99
3  81  34   1  36  94  22  38  64   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the constraints and the valuations provided, we'll attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while maintaining fairness.

Here's one way to approach this allocation problem:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** 
   - For each agent, identify the items that they value highly compared to others.

2. **Balance the Allocation:** 
   - Ensure that each agent receives a comparable total value based on their preferences.

3. **Minimize Envy:** 
   - Try to allocate items such that agents do not feel that another agent has received a significantly better allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations and decide on the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Values items 1 and 5 highly (92 and 96).
- **Agent 1**: Values items 0 and 3 highly (79 and 96).
- **Agent 2**: Values items 4 and 8 highly (75 and 99).
- **Agent 3**: Values items 0 and 4 highly (81 and 94).

Based on these observations, we can make the following allocations:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 since it's their second highest valued and Agent 3 can be compensated elsewhere.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2 as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 as it is one of their highest valued items.

Now let's further distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 5, add items 1 and 2 to balance their total value.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 0, add item 3 to increase their total value.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 8, add item 6 for additional value.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 4, add items 7 for additional value.

This allocation maintains fairness by ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share of their most valued items and balances the total value among agents.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [8, 6],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation should provide a fair distribution of items based on the given valuations.
