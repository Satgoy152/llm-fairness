Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51   8  56  30  17  61  79  10  57
1  21  72   3  43  20  28  58  78  84
2  30  12  90  46  52  95  14  77  93
3  94  22  29  74   9  33  84  36  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives approximately the same total value according to their valuations. This problem may not have a perfect solution, but we can approach it using an algorithmic strategy such as the envy-free allocation or the maximin share approach.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 51 + 8 + 56 + 30 + 17 + 61 + 79 + 10 + 57 = 369
- Agent 1: 21 + 72 + 3 + 43 + 20 + 28 + 58 + 78 + 84 = 407
- Agent 2: 30 + 12 + 90 + 46 + 52 + 95 + 14 + 77 + 93 = 509
- Agent 3: 94 + 22 + 29 + 74 + 9 + 33 + 84 + 36 + 40 = 421

The goal is to distribute items such that the perceived value to each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's proceed with a potential allocation strategy.

We'll try to allocate items to maximize each agent's total perceived value without exceeding the total number of items.

### Allocation Proposal

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 5
   - Total Value: 51 + 61 = 112

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1, 7
   - Total Value: 72 + 78 = 150

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 2, 8
   - Total Value: 90 + 93 = 183

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: 3, 4, 6
   - Total Value: 74 + 9 + 84 = 167

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives, given their respective valuations. The total values are not perfectly equal, but this is a challenging problem due to the disparity in valuations.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 4 agents, attempting to achieve fairness based on the given valuations.
