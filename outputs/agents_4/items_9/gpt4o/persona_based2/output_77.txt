Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  61  14  75  51  71  58  75  81
1   0  10   0  66  48   3  41  93  95
2  83  44  42  58  67  55  78  30  43
3  72  82  90  21  75  26  36  46   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, one common approach is to use the "maximum Nash welfare" method, which attempts to maximize the product of the agents' utilities. This method often leads to allocations that are envy-free or close to envy-free when valuations are additive.

Here are the valuations provided for each agent and item:

- Agent 0: [84, 61, 14, 75, 51, 71, 58, 75, 81]
- Agent 1: [0, 10, 0, 66, 48, 3, 41, 93, 95]
- Agent 2: [83, 44, 42, 58, 67, 55, 78, 30, 43]
- Agent 3: [72, 82, 90, 21, 75, 26, 36, 46, 9]

We need to allocate all 9 items among the 4 agents.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify the highest value per agent per item**: Start by identifying which agent values each item the most.
2. **Assign items to agents with the highest valuation**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible and adjusting to maintain fairness.
3. **Adjust to balance item counts**: If any agent receives too many items, adjust allocations to ensure every agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

### Item Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 (84)
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 (82)
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 (90)
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 (75)
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 (67)
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 (71)
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 (78)
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 (93)
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 (95)

### Adjustments for Fairness and Balance:

Based on the initial allocation strategy, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [7, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 2]

This allocation satisfies the condition where each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 9. The allocations are fairly balanced given the valuations.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that reflects their highest valuations while maintaining a balance in the number of items each agent receives.
