Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  92   1  61  52  31  26  63  31
1  31  63  39  48  11  32  15  12  27
2  16  97  11  43  21  12  58  36  11
3  79  37  44  45  19  49  32  13  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [79 37 44 45 19 49 32 13 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocated set of items is at least as valuable as any other agent's set according to their own valuation.

Given the valuations, let's attempt to distribute the items to achieve an approximately envy-free allocation:

```
Valuations:
Agent 0: [29, 92, 1, 61, 52, 31, 26, 63, 31]
Agent 1: [31, 63, 39, 48, 11, 32, 15, 12, 27]
Agent 2: [16, 97, 11, 43, 21, 12, 58, 36, 11]
Agent 3: [79, 37, 44, 45, 19, 49, 32, 13, 65]
```

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest at 92. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** could maximize their value by taking item 2 with a value of 39.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the highest at 58. We can allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest at 79. We can allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [0]

Remaining items: [3, 4, 5, 7, 8]

Continuing the allocation:
5. **Agent 0** values item 3 next highest after item 1. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 3** values item 8 highly (65), so we allocate item 8 to Agent 3.
7. **Agent 2** can take item 7, valued at 36.
8. **Agent 1** values item 4 at 11, which is the highest among the remaining items for them.
9. **Agent 0** can take the remaining item, 5, which they value at 31.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [6, 7]
- Agent 3: [0, 8]

This allocation attempts to satisfy each agent by maximizing their individual valuations while ensuring each gets a fair share.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 8]
}
```
