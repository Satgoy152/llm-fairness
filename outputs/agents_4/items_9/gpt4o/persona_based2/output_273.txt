Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  76  35   3  62  25  59  50  68
1  66  19  70  93   1  63  41  63  78
2  88  50  83  32  57  51  88  20  14
3  72  48  25  56  31  26  73  92   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we must consider the preferences of each agent. We will use a method that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations, we will use a variation of the "round-robin" method to assign items:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: [0, 1, 8, 4, 6, 7, 2, 5, 3]
2. **Agent 1's Preferences**: [3, 8, 2, 7, 5, 0, 6, 1, 4]
3. **Agent 2's Preferences**: [0, 6, 2, 4, 1, 5, 3, 7, 8]
4. **Agent 3's Preferences**: [7, 0, 6, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 8]

We will rotate through the agents and allocate their highest-value unallocated item until all items are allocated.

**Round 1:**
- Agent 0 receives item 0 (value 70).
- Agent 1 receives item 3 (value 93).
- Agent 2 receives item 6 (value 88).
- Agent 3 receives item 7 (value 92).

**Round 2:**
- Agent 0 receives item 1 (value 76).
- Agent 1 receives item 8 (value 78).
- Agent 2 receives item 2 (value 83).
- Agent 3 receives item 4 (value 31).

**Round 3:**
- Agent 0 receives item 5 (value 25).

All items have been allocated. Now, let's present the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [7, 4]
}
```
