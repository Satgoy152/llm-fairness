Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  65   8  14   7  31  73  55  87
1  59  99  28  30  53  94  34  67  30
2  75  17  48  78  20  28  93  63  51
3  87  80  17  58  90  41  36  19  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, let's aim for an allocation that minimizes envy by considering each agent's valuations and trying to distribute high-value items fairly.

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items 0, 1, and 8.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 and high valuations for items 5 and 7.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6 and high valuations for items 3 and 0.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 0 and high valuations for items 4 and 3.

We'll start by allocating the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 0**: Highly valued by Agent 0, 2, and 3. Allocate to Agent 0 for balance.
- **Item 1**: Highly valued by Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Least valued, allocate to Agent 0 for balance.
- **Item 3**: Highly valued by Agent 2 and 3, allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Highly valued by Agent 3. Allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 5**: Highly valued by Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Highly valued by Agent 2. Allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 7**: Allocated to Agent 3 for balance.
- **Item 8**: Highly valued by Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

Each agent receives their share based on their valuations while trying to keep the distribution envy-free.
