Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  40  17  89  42  27  15  86  14
1  31  31   0   4  92  25  47  11  82
2  95   7  32   7  26  98  89   3  94
3  30   8  34  22  16   7  38  36  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that no agent envies another based on their own valuations.

Let's start by analyzing the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 total valuation: \(55 + 40 + 17 + 89 + 42 + 27 + 15 + 86 + 14 = 385\)
- Agent 1 total valuation: \(31 + 31 + 0 + 4 + 92 + 25 + 47 + 11 + 82 = 323\)
- Agent 2 total valuation: \(95 + 7 + 32 + 7 + 26 + 98 + 89 + 3 + 94 = 451\)
- Agent 3 total valuation: \(30 + 8 + 34 + 22 + 16 + 7 + 38 + 36 + 92 = 283\)

Next, we'll allocate items with the goal of equalizing the perceived value for each agent as much as possible. Let's focus on maximizing each agent's total value.

First, let's allocate the highest-valued items for each agent:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (89).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (92).
3. Agent 2's highest-valued item is 5 (98).
4. Agent 3 values item 8 the most (92).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0's next highest values are items 7 (86) and 0 (55).
- Agent 1 has high values for items 8 (82) and 0 (31).
- Agent 2 has high values for items 0 (95) and 8 (94).
- Agent 3 has high values for items 6 (38) and 2 (34).

Let's make the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 7
- Agent 1: Items 4 and 8
- Agent 2: Items 5 and 0
- Agent 3: Items 6 and 2

Finally, let's allocate the remaining item 1, which has relatively low value across all agents. We can allocate it to Agent 0, who already perceives value from item 3 and 7.

Here's the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 1],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value among agents and minimize envy.
