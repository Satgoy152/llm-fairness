Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  39  62  63  76  81  20  81  46
1  92  66  95  64  91  17  53  41  84
2  80  71  50  65  12  19  43  57  36
3   8  57  82  98   6  70   5  32  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute them so that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other agent's allocation. Given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and exactly 9 items must be allocated in total, we'll proceed as follows:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1 (Index 0):**
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are 5 (value 81) and 7 (value 81).
   - Allocate items 5 and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 2 (Index 1):**
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are 2 (value 95) and 0 (value 92).
   - Allocate items 2 and 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 3 (Index 2):**
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are 0 (value 80) and 3 (value 65), but item 0 is already allocated.
   - Next highest available item is 1 (value 71).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 4 (Index 3):**
   - Highest value items for Agent 3 are 3 (value 98) and 2 (value 82), but item 2 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items 4, 6, and 8 remain.
   - Distribute remaining items to agents aiming to balance total value:
     - Item 4: Allocate to Agent 1 (value 91).
     - Item 6: Allocate to Agent 0 (value 20).
     - Item 8: Allocate to Agent 1 (value 84).

### Final Allocation:

The final allocation aims to maximize each agent's valuation, given the constraints:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 6],
    "1": [2, 0, 4, 8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents while considering their preferences, aiming for an envy-free distribution.
