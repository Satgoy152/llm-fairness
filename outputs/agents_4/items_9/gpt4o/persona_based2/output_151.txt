Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  66  91  53  95  20   1  85  15
1  24   9  52  72  49  24  62  39  77
2  76  96  22   7  66  77  51   8  70
3  82  64   6  57  70  89  20  21   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as balanced as possible in terms of the total valuation each agent receives. Here, we can use a heuristic approach to assign items to agents based on their preferences and valuations.

We will proceed with the following steps:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, if possible.
3. Ensure each agent gets a fair share of total value, considering their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 479
- Agent 1's total valuation: 408
- Agent 2's total valuation: 473
- Agent 3's total valuation: 418

Now, let's assign items:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest valuation at 95).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest valuation at 96).
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (highest valuation at 89).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (second-highest at 82).
5. Assign item 8 to Agent 2 (second-highest at 70).
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation at 72).
7. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (second-highest at 85).
8. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest valuation at 62).
9. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest remaining valuation at 91).

This allocation gives each agent a reasonably equitable share and attempts to minimize overall envy. Now, we will present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least some items, and all 9 items are distributed among the four agents.
