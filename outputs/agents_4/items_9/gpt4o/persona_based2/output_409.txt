Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  45  20  32   0  36  76  50  82
1  20  39   7  64  17  47   0  13   6
2  49  27  54  37  14  12  50  82   8
3  32  14  33  42  35  66  13  92  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. We'll consider the valuations provided and distribute the items to balance the perceived value for each agent. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their satisfaction (value received) while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   Total Valuation: 81 + 45 + 20 + 32 + 0 + 36 + 76 + 50 + 82 = 422  
   Agent 0 values items 0, 8, 6, 1, 7, and 5 highly.

2. **Agent 1:**  
   Total Valuation: 20 + 39 + 7 + 64 + 17 + 47 + 0 + 13 + 6 = 213  
   Agent 1 values item 3 the most.

3. **Agent 2:**  
   Total Valuation: 49 + 27 + 54 + 37 + 14 + 12 + 50 + 82 + 8 = 333  
   Agent 2 values items 7, 2, and 6 highly.

4. **Agent 3:**  
   Total Valuation: 32 + 14 + 33 + 42 + 35 + 66 + 13 + 92 + 67 = 394  
   Agent 3 values items 7, 8, and 5 highly.

### Proposed Allocation:

- Assign item 0 and 8 to Agent 0, as they value these items highly.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 2 and 7 to Agent 2, as they highly value these items.
- Assign items 5 and 8 to Agent 3, as they value these highly.

This distribution attempts to balance the total perceived value among the agents.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [1, 4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

Note: The proposed allocation may not ensure absolute envy-freeness due to the discrete nature of the items and the varying valuations. However, it tries to achieve a fair distribution in terms of perceived value.
