Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  12  85  36  45  82  25  75  14
1   7   8  87  30  21  47  19  88  20
2  95  52  28  98  58  19  73  74  17
3  39  77  53  82  83  58  61  24  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to minimize the envy each agent might feel towards others. A simple heuristic approach is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent's total perceived value of their allocation is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Calculate total valuations for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: 65 + 12 + 85 + 36 + 45 + 82 + 25 + 75 + 14 = 439
   - Agent 1: 7 + 8 + 87 + 30 + 21 + 47 + 19 + 88 + 20 = 327
   - Agent 2: 95 + 52 + 28 + 98 + 58 + 19 + 73 + 74 + 17 = 514
   - Agent 3: 39 + 77 + 53 + 82 + 83 + 58 + 61 + 24 + 30 = 507

2. **Allocate items to agents in a way that balances total value:**
   - Start by assigning each agent one of their highest-valued items.
   - Then distribute the remaining items to balance out the total value for each agent.

Based on this, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [7, 4, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 6]

This allocation seeks to balance the total perceived values among agents, considering their valuations, and ensures that each agent gets a fair share.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [7, 4, 8],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
