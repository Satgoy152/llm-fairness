Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  32  69  50  94  53  66   1  11
1  55  34  15  49  41  15  17  30  48
2  19  31  77  31  85  65  56  91  27
3  18   5  57  73  71  71   6   6  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use an algorithm like the "round-robin" method, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool. This helps approximate fairness but may not achieve perfect envy-freeness due to the discrete nature of the items. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (96), so they pick it first.
2. **Agent 2** values item 7 the highest (91), so they pick it next.
3. **Agent 0** again has the next highest valuation for item 4 (94), so they pick it.
4. **Agent 2** picks item 2 (77), their next highest available valued item.
5. **Agent 3** picks item 5 (71), their highest available valued item.
6. **Agent 3** picks item 4 (71), their next highest available valued item.
7. **Agent 0** picks item 6 (66), their next highest available valued item.
8. **Agent 1** picks item 8 (48), their highest available valued item.
9. **Agent 1** picks item 3 (49), their next highest available valued item.

Now let's allocate the items to each agent.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [8, 3],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items among the agents based on their individual preferences. Each agent gets a reasonable share of their high-valued items, thus aiming for a fair division that minimizes envy.
