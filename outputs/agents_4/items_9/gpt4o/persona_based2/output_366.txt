Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  36  25  49  91  44  95  40  30
1  14  49  25  81  51  55  28  16  70
2  45  14  95  92   3  29  14  78  72
3  13  73  41   6   7  80  86  34  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we can use a simple approach that aims to balance the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations. This approach involves iterating through the agents and items, attempting to maximize the minimum satisfaction for each agent.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent places on all items to get a sense of their overall valuation:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 421
- Agent 1's total valuation: 389
- Agent 2's total valuation: 442
- Agent 3's total valuation: 377

Now, we will allocate items to agents in such a way that the total valuation of items they receive is as balanced as possible, given the valuations.

### Allocation

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: 6 (95), 4 (91) -> Total valuation: 186
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 3 (81), 8 (70), 5 (55) -> Total valuation: 206
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 2 (95), 1 (14) -> Total valuation: 109
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: 7 (34), 0 (13) -> Total valuation: 47

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [3, 8, 5],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [7, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items based on agents' valuations in a way that minimizes envy, although perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable due to the discrete nature of the items and the differing valuations.
