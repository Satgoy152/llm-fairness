Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  66  83  45  52  59  93  62  31
1  90  43  12  76  26  87  99  24  59
2  98  62  99   4  79  76  29  38  76
3  19  54   7  49   7  10  97  69   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, considering the sum of each agent's individual valuations for the items they receive. Given the constraints and the differences in valuations, we will try to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Values: [40, 66, 83, 45, 52, 59, 93, 62, 31]
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0: 6 (93), 2 (83), 1 (66)
   - Allocation: Item 6

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Values: [90, 43, 12, 76, 26, 87, 99, 24, 59]
   - Highest valued items for Agent 1: 6 (99), 0 (90), 5 (87)
   - Allocation: Item 0, 5

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Values: [98, 62, 99, 4, 79, 76, 29, 38, 76]
   - Highest valued items for Agent 2: 2 (99), 0 (98), 4 (79)
   - Allocation: Item 2, 4

4. **Agent 3:**  
   - Values: [19, 54, 7, 49, 7, 10, 97, 69, 1]
   - Highest valued items for Agent 3: 6 (97), 7 (69), 1 (54)
   - Allocation: Item 1, 3, 7, 8

This allocation gives each agent a set of items that maximizes their individual satisfaction based on the given valuations. Note that the allocation considers the highest values for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
