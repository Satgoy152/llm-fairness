Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  77  60   7  35  38   1  23  23
1  91  72  52   3  79  77  86  40   8
2   5  13  83  71  74  41  46  23  44
3  23  75  52  42  24  18  16  76  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that the division is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we can consider the valuations each agent places on each item. The goal is to maximize the perceived fairness by ensuring that each agent believes they have received a fair share.

Let's summarize the total valuation each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 324
- Agent 1: 508
- Agent 2: 400
- Agent 3: 386

A simple approach is to allocate items to maximize the total perceived value for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal share according to their total valuation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify key items for each agent based on their highest valuations.**

   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (77).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (91).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (83).
   - Agent 3 values item 7 the most (76).

2. **Initial allocation of these high-value items:**

   - Agent 0: item 1
   - Agent 1: item 0
   - Agent 2: item 2
   - Agent 3: item 7

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance total perceived value:**

   After allocating the key items, we need to distribute the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives.

   - Agent 0 receives item 4 (35) and item 6 (1).
   - Agent 1 receives item 5 (77).
   - Agent 2 receives item 3 (71) and item 8 (44).
   - Agent 3 receives no additional items.

### Final Allocations:

Let's verify that each agent receives the same number of items and the total number of items allocated is 9.

- **Agent 0:** 1, 4, 6
- **Agent 1:** 0, 5
- **Agent 2:** 2, 3, 8
- **Agent 3:** 7

This allocation is such that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items is 9.

### JSON Format Output

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 8],
    "3": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with a fair share of their perceived value, within the constraints given.
