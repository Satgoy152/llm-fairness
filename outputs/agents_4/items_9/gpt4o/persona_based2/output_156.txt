Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  33  51  26  10  76  73  35  95
1   0  75  44  70   9  35  44   6  19
2  34   6  78  74  31  89  69  53  69
3   6  31  26  31  76  10  21  65  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair compared to others. One method to achieve this is the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" method, where agents take turns selecting their most valued unallocated item. This approach helps in achieving a fair and envy-free distribution of items.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Turn 1: Agent 0 picks first.**  
   Agent 0's highest value is item 8 (value 95). So, agent 0 picks item 8.

2. **Turn 2: Agent 1 picks next.**  
   Agent 1's highest remaining value is item 1 (value 75). So, agent 1 picks item 1.

3. **Turn 3: Agent 2 picks next.**  
   Agent 2's highest remaining value is item 5 (value 89). So, agent 2 picks item 5.

4. **Turn 4: Agent 3 picks next.**  
   Agent 3's highest remaining value is item 4 (value 76). So, agent 3 picks item 4.

5. **Turn 5: Agent 0 picks again.**  
   Agent 0's next highest remaining value is item 0 (value 76). So, agent 0 picks item 0.

6. **Turn 6: Agent 1 picks again.**  
   Agent 1's next highest remaining value is item 3 (value 70). So, agent 1 picks item 3.

7. **Turn 7: Agent 2 picks again.**  
   Agent 2's next highest remaining value is item 2 (value 78). So, agent 2 picks item 2.

8. **Turn 8: Agent 3 picks again.**  
   Agent 3's next highest remaining value is item 7 (value 65). So, agent 3 picks item 7.

9. **Turn 9: Agent 0 picks again.**  
   Agent 0's next highest remaining value is item 6 (value 73). So, agent 0 picks item 6.

This method results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

Each agent has received items based on their highest valuations in a turn-based manner, which helps ensure a fair distribution and minimizes envy among agents.
