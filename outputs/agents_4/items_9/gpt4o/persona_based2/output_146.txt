Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  13  94  23   1  81  27  11  29
1  29   6   9  74  15  53   0  43  85
2  56  22  43  83  90  92  49  93  88
3  68  75  32  94  72  26  10  22  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and attempt to ensure envy-freeness, we should allocate items in a way that considers each agent's valuation of the items. One approach is to use the "maximum marginal utility" method, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and we try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 49, which is the highest among all agents. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it at 75, which is the highest. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 94, which is the highest. Assign item 2 to agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it at 94, which is the highest. Assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it at 90, which is the highest. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it at 92, which is the highest. Assign item 5 to agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it at 49, which is the highest. Assign item 6 to agent 2.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it at 93, which is the highest. Assign item 7 to agent 2.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it at 85, which is the highest. Assign item 8 to agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items: [0, 2]
- Agent 1 has item: [8]
- Agent 2 has items: [4, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 3 has items: [1, 3]

All 9 items are allocated. While this method aims to be fair by maximizing the value each agent receives according to their preferences, it doesn't guarantee complete envy-freeness because the number of items is limited and discrete.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4, 5, 6, 7],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
