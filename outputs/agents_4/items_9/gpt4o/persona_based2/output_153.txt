Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  15  19  84  37  32  73  21  52
1  26  39  34  98  94  55  10  50  56
2  94  73  81  66   7  45   3  30  70
3  45  79  63  60  10  60  43  27   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the 9 items among the 4 agents, we will aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle based on their individual valuations.

Given the valuations, our task is to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, especially with indivisible items, we can attempt to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent Preferences:**
   - Identify the highest-valued items for each agent to get a starting point for allocations.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign each agent the item they value the most, if possible, without duplication.

3. **Balancing Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate the rest of the items based on the remaining highest values for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if feasible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation

- **Agent 0:** Highest value is for item 3 (value 84).
- **Agent 1:** Highest value is for item 3 (value 98), but since item 3 is already allocated, next highest is item 4 (value 94).
- **Agent 2:** Highest value is for item 0 (value 94).
- **Agent 3:** Highest value is for item 1 (value 79).

**Initial Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [1]

**Allocate Remaining Items:**

- **Remaining Items:** 2, 5, 6, 7, 8

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Next highest is item 6 (value 73).
  - Allocation: [3, 6]

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Next highest is item 8 (value 56).
  - Allocation: [4, 8]

- **Agent 2:** 
  - Next highest is item 2 (value 81).
  - Allocation: [0, 2]

- **Agent 3:** 
  - Next highest is item 5 (value 60).
  - Allocation: [1, 5]

- **Remaining Item:** 7
  - This item can be given to the agent who benefits most relative to their current allocation.
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 7 (value 50).
  - Final Allocation for Agent 1: [4, 8, 7]

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 8, 7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy based on their valuations.
