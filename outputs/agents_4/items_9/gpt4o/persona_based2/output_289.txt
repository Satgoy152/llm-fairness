Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  77  89  90  78  11  26  47  22
1  49  35  66  56   7  59  18  14  50
2  88   0  51   5  87  32   9  24  49
3  66  30  37  50  65  25  70  57   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the allocation to any other agent. However, given the constraint of integer allocations and the limited number of items, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible. Instead, we can aim for a fair division that minimizes envy.

One common method to achieve a fair division is the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method. In this approach, agents take turns picking the most valued item that is still available. The order of picking can be randomized or based on some criterion like lexicographic order.

Let's proceed with a round-robin allocation based on the agent numbers (0, 1, 2, 3) for simplicity:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0 picks first:** The most valued item for Agent 0 is item 3 (value 90).
2. **Agent 1 picks next:** The most valued item for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 66).
3. **Agent 2 picks next:** The most valued item for Agent 2 is item 0 (value 88).
4. **Agent 3 picks next:** The most valued item for Agent 3 is item 6 (value 70).
5. **Agent 0 picks again:** The next most valued item for Agent 0 is item 2, which is taken. Choose item 1 (value 77).
6. **Agent 1 picks again:** The next most valued item for Agent 1 is item 5 (value 59).
7. **Agent 2 picks again:** The next most valued item for Agent 2 is item 4 (value 87).
8. **Agent 3 picks again:** The next most valued item for Agent 3 is item 4, which is taken. Choose item 7 (value 57).
9. **Agent 0 picks again:** The next most valued item for Agent 0 is item 0, which is taken. Choose item 8 (value 22).

### Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items: 3, 1, 8
- Agent 1 gets items: 2, 5
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 4
- Agent 3 gets items: 6, 7

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 8],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they highly value, considering the constraints.
