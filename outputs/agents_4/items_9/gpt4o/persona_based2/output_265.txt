Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  34  50   0  25  11  48   1  26
1  52  26  46  56  24  79  49  38  12
2  79   1  30  15  73  61  19  96  48
3  74  45  26  41  60  43  65  47  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to allocate resources such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations of the items from each agent's perspective, we need to allocate the 9 items to the 4 agents.

Let's start by examining the values each agent assigns to the items and try to distribute them to maximize each agent's satisfaction while maintaining fairness.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has an extremely high valuation for item 7 (96) and item 0 (79), which are significantly higher than other agents' valuations for these items. Allocating these items to Agent 2 reduces potential envy.
   - Assign items 0 and 7 to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (79), and no other agent values this item as much. This item should go to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 8 (62), which is the highest for this item across all agents. Assigning item 8 to Agent 3 will reduce potential envy.
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 3.

4. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 2 (50), which is not as highly valued by other agents. This item should go to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

5. Remaining items: 1, 3, 4, 6.

6. **Agent 0** also values item 1 highly (34), more than others. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

7. **Agent 3** values item 3 (41) the most after allocating item 8. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

8. **Agent 2** can still benefit from item 4 (73), which is highly valued by them compared to others.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

9. Finally, item 6 is best allocated to **Agent 3** to balance the distribution and because Agent 3 values it (65) more than the remaining unallocated items for fairness.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 7, 4],
    "3": [8, 3, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. This distribution aims to reduce envy by considering each agent's highest valuations and distributing items accordingly.
