Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  29  88  30  53  54  18  98  13
1  89   9  86  31  48  25  48  16  20
2  88  90  87  84  26  54  37  74  74
3  84  69  25  67  61  45  29  74  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness and considering the valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items. A simple approach in this scenario is to use a greedy method where each agent picks their most valued available item in turns until all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations table:

```
      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0:   58  29  88  30  53  54  18  98  13
1:   89   9  86  31  48  25  48  16  20
2:   88  90  87  84  26  54  37  74  74
3:   84  69  25  67  61  45  29  74  78
```

1. **Agent 0** values item 7 the most, so they get item 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most, so they get item 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most, so they get item 1.
4. **Agent 3** values item 8 the most, so they get item 8.

Next, iterate again as some items are still available:

5. **Agent 0** values item 2 the next most, so they get item 2.
6. **Agent 1** values item 3 the next most, so they get item 3.
7. **Agent 2** values item 6 the next most, so they get item 6.
8. **Agent 3** values item 4 the next most, so they get item 4.

Finally, one item remains:

9. **Agent 0** values item 5 the next most, so they get item 5.

Now all items have been allocated. Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [8, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction and aims for fairness by considering each agent's preferences in a round-robin order.
