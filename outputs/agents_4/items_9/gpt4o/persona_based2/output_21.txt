Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  40  57  16  47  55  49  52  61
1  35  52  49  71  44  49  10  26  25
2   7  85  28  73  43  87  10   8  46
3   1  18  24  18  40  62  60  63  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we can aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle. This is challenging with indivisible goods, but we can strive for an allocation that minimizes envy.

Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values for items: [3, 40, 57, 16, 47, 55, 49, 52, 61]
   - Prioritize items with the highest value: Items 8, 2, 5 (values: 61, 57, 55)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values for items: [35, 52, 49, 71, 44, 49, 10, 26, 25]
   - Prioritize items with the highest value: Items 3, 1 (values: 71, 52)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values for items: [7, 85, 28, 73, 43, 87, 10, 8, 46]
   - Prioritize items with the highest value: Items 5, 1 (values: 87, 85)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values for items: [1, 18, 24, 18, 40, 62, 60, 63, 58]
   - Prioritize items with the highest value: Items 7, 6, 5 (values: 63, 60, 62)

Given the constraints of integer allocations and ensuring all items are allocated, here is one possible distribution that seeks to balance these priorities:

- **Agent 0**: Items with high relative value for them - [8, 2]
- **Agent 1**: Items with high relative value for them - [3]
- **Agent 2**: Items with high relative value for them - [5, 1]
- **Agent 3**: Items with high relative value for them - [7, 6, 4, 0]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively high compared to others, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [7, 6, 4, 0]
}
```

This allocation respects the requirement to distribute all 9 items while aiming to minimize envy among agents based on their valuations.
