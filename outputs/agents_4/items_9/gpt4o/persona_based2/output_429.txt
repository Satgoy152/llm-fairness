Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  14  67   0   1  20  94  90  56
1   1  48  61   2  93  92  41  78  49
2  26  43  40  73  86  79  83  31  13
3  75   9  18  83  22  77  58  69  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we will aim for an allocation that reduces envy among the agents. A common approach in fair division is to attempt to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as much as possible, given the constraints.

Here is a proposed allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Calculate the total valuation each agent has across all items to understand their preferences.
   
2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign items to agents in a way that attempts to balance their total perceived value from the items they receive.

Let's proceed with this allocation strategy:

### Total Valuations by Agent:

- **Agent 0:** 59 + 14 + 67 + 0 + 1 + 20 + 94 + 90 + 56 = 401
- **Agent 1:** 1 + 48 + 61 + 2 + 93 + 92 + 41 + 78 + 49 = 465
- **Agent 2:** 26 + 43 + 40 + 73 + 86 + 79 + 83 + 31 + 13 = 474
- **Agent 3:** 75 + 9 + 18 + 83 + 22 + 77 + 58 + 69 + 88 = 499

### Allocating Items:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0, 6 (High valuation: 59, 94)
2. **Agent 1**: Items 4, 5, 7 (High valuation: 93, 92, 78)
3. **Agent 2**: Items 1, 3 (High valuation: 43, 73)
4. **Agent 3**: Items 2, 8 (High valuation: 18, 88)

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with a bundle that has significant value to them, based on their individual valuations. Note that agent preferences and item values can lead to multiple fair allocations, and this is one proposed solution.
