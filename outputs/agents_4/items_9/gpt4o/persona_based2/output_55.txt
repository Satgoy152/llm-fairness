Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  60  64   0  27  69   8  32  27
1  81  74  34  68  27  85   5  49  34
2  87   8  85  22  92  49  62  23  47
3  21   0  69  25  44  79  38  81   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation Per Item**: Each item should ideally be allocated to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 87.
   - **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 60.
   - **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 64.
   - **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 68.
   - **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 92.
   - **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most at 85.
   - **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most at 62.
   - **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most at 81.
   - **Item 8**: Agent 2 values it the most at 47.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**:
   - Agent 2 has been allocated too many items. We aim to redistribute some items to achieve a more balanced allocation.
   - Reassign items to ensure each agent gets at least one item and balance the number of items as evenly as possible.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
   - Agent 1: Items [3, 5]
   - Agent 2: Items [0, 6, 8]
   - Agent 3: Items [4, 7]

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent has a relatively fair share based on their valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 6, 8],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
