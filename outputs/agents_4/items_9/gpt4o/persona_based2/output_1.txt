Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  47   7  20  96  45  40  18  80
1  97  43  46  29  46  80  29  81  87
2  29   5   5  30  92  56  35  37   9
3  12  11  62   9  26  16  56  83  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an envy-free division. An envy-free division ensures that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as they would have received with any other agent's allocation.

First, let's calculate the total perceived value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 79 + 47 + 7 + 20 + 96 + 45 + 40 + 18 + 80 = 432
- Agent 1: 97 + 43 + 46 + 29 + 46 + 80 + 29 + 81 + 87 = 538
- Agent 2: 29 + 5 + 5 + 30 + 92 + 56 + 35 + 37 + 9 = 298
- Agent 3: 12 + 11 + 62 + 9 + 26 + 16 + 56 + 83 + 51 = 326

Now, let's find an allocation that attempts to minimize envy. We will try to allocate high-value items to agents who value them most:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 because they value it highest (value 96).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 because they value it highest (value 97).
3. Allocate item 8 to Agent 1 because they also value it highly (value 87).
4. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 because they value it highest (value 83).
5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 because they value it highly (value 80).
6. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 because they value it high (value 47).
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 because they value it high (value 56).
8. Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 because they value it highest (value 62).
9. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 because they value it the most (value 30).

Here's the allocation based on the above decisions:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 8, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [3]
- Agent 3: Items [7, 6, 2]

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 8, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7, 6, 2]
}
```
