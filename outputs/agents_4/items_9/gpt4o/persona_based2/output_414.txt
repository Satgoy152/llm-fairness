Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  79  35  77  60   6  84  20  54
1  93  50  50  17  65  37   4  26  38
2  18  11  98  87  29  55  88  74  56
3  51  48  82  89   1  83  66  94  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to allocate items such that the distribution is envy-free or at least as fair as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own given their valuations.

Here is a possible allocation strategy using a round-robin approach, considering each agent's highest valued items and ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 6 (value 84).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0 (value 93).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 2 (value 98).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 7 (value 94).

After allocating one item to each agent, we have:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [7]

Now, continue allocating the remaining items to balance the total value as much as possible across agents.

5. **Agent 0**: Second highest value is for item 3 (value 77).
6. **Agent 1**: Second highest value is for item 4 (value 65).
7. **Agent 2**: Second highest value is for item 3, but it's taken, next is item 6 but it's taken too, so item 8 (value 56).
8. **Agent 3**: Second highest value is for item 5 (value 83).

Now, the updated allocations are:

- Agent 0: [6, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 8]
- Agent 3: [7, 5]

There is one item left, item 1. Given the remaining values:

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 79.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 50.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 11.
- Agent 3 values item 1 at 48.

Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1, so Agent 0 receives item 1.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [6, 3, 1]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 8]
- Agent 3: [7, 5]

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives according to their valuations.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [7, 5]
}
```
