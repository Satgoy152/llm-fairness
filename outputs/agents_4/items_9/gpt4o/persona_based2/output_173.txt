Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  83  67  33  36  65  38  57  61
1  72  90  33  47  77  59  67   7  87
2  14  53  77  61  80   8  81  74  80
3   4  89   3  54  26  55  59  99  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the four agents, we aim to consider the preferences of each agent as indicated by their valuation of each item. An ideal allocation is one where no agent envies another agent's allocation, given their own valuations. This is often challenging but can be approached by maximizing the total value each agent perceives they receive from their allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to finding a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Preferences:** Each agent values items differently. We should start by identifying the most preferred items for each agent based on their valuations.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Assign items to agents starting with the highest valuations and try to ensure that each agent gets some of their most valued items.

3. **Iterate and Adjust:** Check for envy-freeness and adjust allocations if necessary. If an agent envies another, consider potential swaps or reallocations to reduce envy.

4. **Final Allocation:** Ensure each agent receives at least some items (if possible), and all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 values item 1 and 4 the most.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4, 6, and 8.
- Agent 3 values item 7 highly.

Given these preferences, let's allocate items to minimize envy and maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations.

### Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 6, 8],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

- **Agent 0**: Gets items 0 and 1, which they value highly.
- **Agent 1**: Gets items 3 and 4, balancing their preferences.
- **Agent 2**: Gets items 2, 6, and 8, which are among their top preferences.
- **Agent 3**: Gets items 5 and 7, which they value highly.

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that each agent is satisfied with their own allocation, given the constraints and the need to allocate all items.
