Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  71  54  26  82  55  22  74  79
1  99  87  83  38   7  42  91  12  99
2  36  57  35  52  79  66  68  69  67
3  52  19  46  12  41  35  43  81  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness to the extent possible, we can use a method such as the Round Robin or the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. Since each agent has different valuations for the items, we aim to allocate the items in a way that maximizes individual satisfaction while minimizing envy.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process based on the valuations:

1. **Round Robin Allocation**: Each agent takes turns selecting their most preferred available item. This method can ensure an initial fair division.

2. **Iterative Selection**: In each round, each agent selects their most valued item among the remaining unallocated ones.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step allocation:

**Round 1:**
- Agent 0 selects item 0 (value: 97).
- Agent 1 selects item 8 (value: 99).
- Agent 2 selects item 4 (value: 79).
- Agent 3 selects item 7 (value: 81).

**Round 2:**
- Agent 0 selects item 1 (value: 71).
- Agent 1 selects item 2 (value: 83).
- Agent 2 selects item 5 (value: 66).
- Agent 3 selects item 6 (value: 43).

**Final Item:**
- Agent 0 selects item 3 (value: 26).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least 2 items, with Agent 0 getting the extra item to balance the allocation.

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [8, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [7, 6]
}
```

This allocation method attempts to balance the distribution of items based on individual valuations and ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.
