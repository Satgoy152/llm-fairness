Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  90  26  18  39  41  78  16  36
1  77  25  27  68  28  93  37  85  34
2  53  91  19  94  92  47  91  49  46
3  68   5  24  38  35  94  76  72  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is envy-free, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This approach balances the product of the utilities of the agents, aiming to achieve an allocation where no agent envies another.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the items and their valuations for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: [25, 90, 26, 18, 39, 41, 78, 16, 36]
   - Agent 1: [77, 25, 27, 68, 28, 93, 37, 85, 34]
   - Agent 2: [53, 91, 19, 94, 92, 47, 91, 49, 46]
   - Agent 3: [68, 5, 24, 38, 35, 94, 76, 72, 96]

2. **Determine initial allocation based on highest valuations**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, aiming to maximize the product of utilities.

3. **Adjust to minimize envy and ensure integer allocation**:
   - Swap items between agents if it increases the overall fairness without causing envy.

Let's go ahead with the allocation based on the valuations while trying to balance the allocations:

- **Item 0**: Highest value for agent 1 (77)
- **Item 1**: Highest value for agent 2 (91)
- **Item 2**: Highest value for agent 0 (26)
- **Item 3**: Highest value for agent 2 (94)
- **Item 4**: Highest value for agent 2 (92)
- **Item 5**: Highest value for agent 3 (94)
- **Item 6**: Highest value for agent 0 (78)
- **Item 7**: Highest value for agent 1 (85)
- **Item 8**: Highest value for agent 3 (96)

Now, let's ensure each agent receives an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 3: Items [5, 8]

This allocation is balanced and attempts to minimize envy, given the constraints of the problem. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 3, 4],
    "3": [5, 8]
}
```
