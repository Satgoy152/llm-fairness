Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  87  14  62   3  45   0  55  59
1  65  16  76  55  21  45  37  32  87
2  91  28  57  94  31  44  95  97  61
3  49  41  31  74  72  18  72  93  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value, while trying to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible given the constraints. The goal is to distribute all 9 items among the 4 agents.

First, let's consider the preferences and valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (87) and item 3 next (62).
- Agent 1 values item 8 the most (87) and item 2 next (76).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (95) and item 7 next (97).
- Agent 3 values item 7 the most (93) and item 3 next (74).

Given these preferences, we will allocate items to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while attempting to prevent envy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1, 3, and 4.
   - Total value: 87 (item 1) + 62 (item 3) + 3 (item 4) = 152

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2 and 8.
   - Total value: 76 (item 2) + 87 (item 8) = 163

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items 5 and 6.
   - Total value: 44 (item 5) + 95 (item 6) = 139

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 0 and item 7.
   - Total value: 49 (item 0) + 93 (item 7) = 142

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and it distributes the items in a way that attempts to balance the perceived total value among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```
