Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  33  36  60  15  22  81   8  93
1  55  36  61  62  93  25  37  56  86
2   6  34  97  34  94   2  78  54   8
3  18  83  56  77  14  72  93   6  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly, while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. Given the table of valuations, we can use a method like maximizing the Nash social welfare or using an algorithm like the round-robin to get as close to envy-freeness as possible.

Let's start by reviewing each agent's preferences and then proceed to allocate items step by step.

### Valuation Table Recap
- **Agent 0** values item 8 the most (93), followed by item 6 (81).
- **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (93), followed by item 8 (86).
- **Agent 2** values item 2 the most (97), followed by item 4 (94).
- **Agent 3** values item 6 the most (93), followed by item 3 (77).

### Allocation Process
1. **Agent 0**: We start by assigning item 8 to Agent 0 as it is their highest valued item.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 to Agent 1 since it is their most valued item.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 to Agent 2, which they value the highest.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 6 to Agent 3, their most valued item.

Now, each agent has received one item. We continue assigning the remaining items, taking into account the next highest preferences and ensuring as little envy as possible.

5. **Agent 0**: Next highest valued item is 6 (already allocated), so we assign item 3 (60).
6. **Agent 1**: Next highest valued item is 8 (already allocated), so we assign item 3 (already allocated), then item 7 (56).
7. **Agent 2**: Agent 2's next highest is item 4 (already allocated), then item 6 (already allocated), so we assign item 7 (54).
8. **Agent 3**: Agent 3's next highest is item 5 (72).

Finally, we allocate the remaining items based on remaining preferences:

9. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (44).
10. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (36).
11. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (2).
12. **Agent 3**: Assign item 1 (already allocated), then item 8 (already allocated), then item 0 (already allocated), assign item 5 instead.

### Final Allocations
The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3, 0],
    "1": [4, 7, 1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6, 5]
}
```

This distribution considers each agent's preferences and aims to minimize envy as much as reasonably possible within the constraints of the problem.
