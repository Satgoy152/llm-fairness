Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  83  30   4  74  72  91  34  10
1  40  80  16  71  10  69  31  61  73
2  76  54  81  48  69   7  25  65   4
3  47  16  10  24  77  35  14  25  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own. A common approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) criterion, which balances efficiency and fairness.

Let's evaluate the allocations:

1. **Calculate Total Value of Items for each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 95 + 83 + 30 + 4 + 74 + 72 + 91 + 34 + 10 = 493
   - Agent 1: 40 + 80 + 16 + 71 + 10 + 69 + 31 + 61 + 73 = 451
   - Agent 2: 76 + 54 + 81 + 48 + 69 + 7 + 25 + 65 + 4 = 429
   - Agent 3: 47 + 16 + 10 + 24 + 77 + 35 + 14 + 25 + 27 = 275

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**

   - Item 0: Highest value by Agent 0 (95)
   - Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (83)
   - Item 2: Highest value by Agent 2 (81)
   - Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (71)
   - Item 4: Highest value by Agent 3 (77)
   - Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (72)
   - Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (91)
   - Item 7: Highest value by Agent 2 (65)
   - Item 8: Highest value by Agent 1 (73)

3. **Final Allocation:**

   Let's aim for a balanced allocation by considering both individual item values and total allocations.

   - Agent 0: [0, 1, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1: [3, 8]
   - Agent 2: [2, 7]
   - Agent 3: [4]

This allocation distributes the items in a way that each agent receives a bundle tailored to their highest preferences while keeping the total number of items allocated equal to 9.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [4]
}
```
