Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  48  91  72  82  43  66  70  13
1  19  48  85  38  73  28  51  31  76
2  71  33  56  55  50  74  92  71  22
3  97  98  49  47   7  72  93   0  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem of fairly allocating items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, one approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, adjusting for any already assigned items to ensure each agent receives at least some items.

Here's how the allocation can be made:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 97.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most at 98.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 72.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 82.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most at 74.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most at 92.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most at 70.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it the most at 76.

By ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and adjusting the allocation to maintain a balance, we can achieve a fair distribution. We make sure each agent is allocated at least one item or adjust accordingly to ensure all items are distributed.

After making sure all items are allocated fairly, the final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and the total number of items distributed is 9, as required.
