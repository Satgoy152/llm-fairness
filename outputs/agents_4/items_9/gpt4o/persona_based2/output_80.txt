Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  33  51  97  48  73  20  92  68
1  43  14  30  76  67  52  72  32  76
2  40  93  69  80   6  83  24  12  33
3  83  97  38  61  57  13  19  40   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints of the problem. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items of another agent over their own allocation.

Here's a simple approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: 37 + 33 + 51 + 97 + 48 + 73 + 20 + 92 + 68 = 519
   - Agent 1: 43 + 14 + 30 + 76 + 67 + 52 + 72 + 32 + 76 = 462
   - Agent 2: 40 + 93 + 69 + 80 + 6 + 83 + 24 + 12 + 33 = 440
   - Agent 3: 83 + 97 + 38 + 61 + 57 + 13 + 19 + 40 + 4  = 412

2. **Determine the fair share for each agent:**
   Each agent should get a fair share of total value, approximated by dividing the total value by the number of agents.

3. **Assign items to agents:**
   Assign items by maximizing each agent's valuation while balancing the number of items each agent receives, aiming for an approximately equal distribution in terms of value.

Given these valuations and constraints, here's a potential allocation where each agent receives at least two items, and the allocation seeks to reduce envy:

- Agent 0 receives items with highest valuations: [3, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items with highest valuations: [4, 8]
- Agent 2 receives items with highest valuations: [1, 5]
- Agent 3 receives items with highest valuations: [0, 2, 6]

This allocation considers the individual valuations and attempts to balance the overall utility each agent receives.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
