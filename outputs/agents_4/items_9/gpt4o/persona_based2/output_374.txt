Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  58  44  75  30  33  78  69  94
1  70  14  74  79  46  36  56  83  35
2  93  22  67  71  15  77  21  78  85
3  58  53  15  86  20  57   4  94  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible. This often involves considering each agent's valuation of the items and attempting to maximize overall satisfaction, minimizing potential envy between agents. 

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [46, 58, 44, 75, 30, 33, 78, 69, 94]
Agent 1: [70, 14, 74, 79, 46, 36, 56, 83, 35]
Agent 2: [93, 22, 67, 71, 15, 77, 21, 78, 85]
Agent 3: [58, 53, 15, 86, 20, 57, 4, 94, 52]
```

We aim to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation is as valuable to them as possible while ensuring each item is allocated once. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items 8 (value 94) and 6 (value 78)
   - Total value = 172
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items 3 (value 79) and 7 (value 83)
   - Total value = 162

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items 0 (value 93) and 5 (value 77)
   - Total value = 170

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items 4 (value 20), 1 (value 53), and 2 (value 15)
   - Total value = 88

This distribution aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least 2 items, except for agent 3 who receives more due to their lower valuation scores overall.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items while striving to keep the distribution as fair as possible based on the given valuations.
