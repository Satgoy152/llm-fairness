Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  31  87  58  36  66  39  17  70
1  32  41  98  76  70  62  90  82  12
2  42  82  23  70  64   5  63  95  25
3  53  60  62  62  96  16  43  20  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and tries to balance the total value each agent receives. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

### Valuation Matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 | Item 8 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 94     | 31     | 87     | 58     | 36     | 66     | 39     | 17     | 70     |
| 1     | 32     | 41     | 98     | 76     | 70     | 62     | 90     | 82     | 12     |
| 2     | 42     | 82     | 23     | 70     | 64     | 5      | 63     | 95     | 25     |
| 3     | 53     | 60     | 62     | 62     | 96     | 16     | 43     | 20     | 94     |

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with the highest value for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with the highest value for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with the highest value for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Prioritize items with the highest value for Agent 3.

By examining the highest values for each agent, we can attempt to distribute the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (94), Item 2 (87) - Total Value: 181
- **Agent 1**: Item 6 (90), Item 3 (76) - Total Value: 166
- **Agent 2**: Item 7 (95), Item 1 (82) - Total Value: 177
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (96), Item 8 (94), Item 5 (16) - Total Value: 206

### Allocations:

Allocating the items based on the above strategy, while ensuring each agent gets the most valued items available to them, we get the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [7, 1],
    "3": [4, 8, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a number of items proportional to their preferences, minimizing potential envy.
