Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  99  71  36  13  23  58  65  94
1  11  27   5  23  57  10  20  49  48
2  86  90  59  28  49  79   6  26  65
3  94  63  61   4  83  65  43  31  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations such that envy-freeness or some approximation of it is achieved. This means that each agent should prefer their own bundle over that of any other agent's, based on their valuations. Given the constraints, we must also ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items:

- **Agent 0** values items 1 and 8 highly (99 and 94, respectively), so it's reasonable to prioritize these for Agent 0 to minimize envy.
- **Agent 1** doesn't have very high valuations, but giving them items they value higher relative to others might help balance. Items 4 and 3 could be a choice here.
- **Agent 2** values item 1 (90) and item 0 (86) highly, but since item 1 is given to Agent 0, we'll give item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 0 (94) the most, but since item 0 is allocated to Agent 2, we should consider other high-valued items like item 4 (83) for Agent 3.

Proceeding with these insights, here is a potential allocation plan:

1. Allocate item 1 and item 8 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate items 0 and 7 to Agent 2.
4. Allocate items 2, 5, and 6 to Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to balance the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures all items are allocated and attempts to respect the agents' preferences as closely as possible given the constraints.
