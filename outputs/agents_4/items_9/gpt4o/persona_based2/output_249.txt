Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  56   6   9  63   7  65  71  64
1  34  22  48  52  64  59  72   6  38
2  40  14  82  52  53  39   0  86  74
3  77  86  91  20  97  50  68  74  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we seek to minimize envy and aim for a proportional distribution. The goal is to ensure that no agent feels worse off compared to others based on their own valuation of the items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent has a different set of preferences for the items.
   - The total number of items is 9, and we need to allocate all 9 items.

2. **Valuation Summary:**
   - **Agent 0**: High valuation for item 7.
   - **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 6.
   - **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 2 and 7.
   - **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 4 and 1.

3. **Priority Assignment:**
   - Assign high valued items first to the respective agents who value them the most.

4. **Allocation Process:**
   - **Agent 0**: Assign item 7 (highest valuation for agent 0).
   - **Agent 1**: Assign item 6 (highest valuation for agent 1).
   - **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (highest valuation for agent 2).
   - **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 (highest valuation for agent 3).

5. **Distributing Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8
   - Allocate items based on remaining needs and reducing envy.
   - **Agent 0**: Assign items 5 and 8 (next highest valuations among remaining).
   - **Agent 1**: Assign item 3.
   - **Agent 2**: Assign item 1.
   - **Agent 3**: Assign item 0.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure every item is allocated and each agent receives at least one item, with an aim for minimal envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5, 8],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect the valuations of each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.
