Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  17  23  63  42  88  97  23  84
1  96  12  91  48  50  57  76  47  87
2  94  16  54  42  94  40  90  96  25
3  55  56  73  65  76   0  76  76  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation to the extent possible, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach to achieve this is to use a modified version of the "round-robin" method based on the agents' valuations for the items. We will allocate items one by one to the agent who values the unallocated item the most, iterating through the items until all are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 96, so allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most at 56, so allocate to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 91, so allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 63, so allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 42, but Agent 2 also values it at 94 (highest value), so allocate to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 88, so allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most at 97, so allocate to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most at 96, so allocate to Agent 2.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it the most at 87, so allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's distribute the items in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 8],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
