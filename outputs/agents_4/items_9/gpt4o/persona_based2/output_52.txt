Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  70  23  65  71  91  69  79  68
1  69  55  56   8  53  49  94  23  96
2  53  18   3  53  89  96  21  30   2
3  14  28  32  79  90  15  20  22  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the 9 items among the 4 agents such that envy-freeness is achieved as closely as possible. We consider the valuations given for each item by each agent to guide the allocation.

An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations. While it's not always possible to achieve perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations, we can strive for a fair distribution based on the given preferences.

Let's analyze the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 5 (91) and 1 (70).
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 8 (96) and 6 (94).
3. **Agent 2** values items 5 (96) and 4 (89) the most.
4. **Agent 3** has higher valuations for items 4 (90) and 3 (79).

Given these preferences, let's attempt to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** should receive items that they value relatively higher than others, such as item 5 and item 1.
- **Agent 1** should receive items 8 and 6, which they value very highly.
- **Agent 2** should receive item 4, which is among the highest valued by them.
- **Agent 3** should receive item 3, which they value highly.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated and attempt to balance the allocation further:

1. **Assign Items:**
   - Agent 0: Give items 0, 2, and 5 (values: 50, 23, 91)
   - Agent 1: Give items 6 and 8 (values: 94, 96)
   - Agent 2: Give items 1 and 4 (values: 18, 89)
   - Agent 3: Give items 3 and 7 (values: 79, 22)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, and the distribution of items is balanced among the agents.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
