Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  73  99  47  36  86  27  26  39
1  78  42  68  31  46  17  72  34  79
2  75  40  93  81  83  31  32  62  77
3   2  42  68  96  36  69  49  88  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations. Given the valuations matrix provided, one approach to achieve a fair division is to perform an iterative allocation process considering the maximum valuations for each agent. 

Let's outline the steps and then provide the allocation:

1. **Initial Analysis**: 
   - Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items to see their overall valuation capacity.
   - Analyze which items are most valued by each agent.

2. **Iterative Allocation**:
   - Allocate items by considering each agent's highest preference first, ensuring no agent is envious of another's allocation (as much as possible).
   - Check after each allocation if all items have been distributed and if each agent is getting their fair share based on their valuations.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - If necessary, make slight adjustments to ensure all items are allocated and each agent has a fair chance of getting the items they value most.

Here is the allocation based on the above considerations:

- **Agent 0** gets items [2, 5]
  - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0 (99), and item 5 is also highly valued (86).
- **Agent 1** gets items [0, 8]
  - Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 1 (78), and item 8 has a substantial value (79).
- **Agent 2** gets items [3, 4]
  - Items 3 and 4 are highly valued by Agent 2 (81 and 83, respectively).
- **Agent 3** gets items [1, 6, 7]
  - Items 1, 6, and 7 collectively offer Agent 3 a balanced valuation, with item 7 being the highest (88).

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest priority items for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
