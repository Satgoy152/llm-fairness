Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  40  79  18  91  10  80  72   3
1  14  18  39  44  23  19  61  38  95
2  70   7  82  52  35  30  31   1  62
3  16   0   1  65  93   1  88  85  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, which means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

Agent 0: [50, 40, 79, 18, 91, 10, 80, 72, 3]  
Agent 1: [14, 18, 39, 44, 23, 19, 61, 38, 95]  
Agent 2: [70, 7, 82, 52, 35, 30, 31, 1, 62]  
Agent 3: [16, 0, 1, 65, 93, 1, 88, 85, 29]  

To achieve a fair allocation, we will consider the highest value items for each agent and try to allocate them in a way that balances the total perceived value. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (91) and item 6 (80). Let's allocate them to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 8 (95) the most. Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 (82) and item 0 (70) the most. Allocate them to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 (93) the highest, but it's already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest valued items for Agent 3 are item 6 (88) and item 7 (85). Item 6 is allocated, so allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Now review the unallocated items: 1, 3, 5.

- **Item 1**: Agent 0 has the highest value (40) among unallocated items, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agents 3 (65) and 2 (52) have the highest values. Since Agent 3 has only one item, allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 has the highest value (30), so allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Allocations are now complete. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [2, 0, 5],
    "3": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation should ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuation.
