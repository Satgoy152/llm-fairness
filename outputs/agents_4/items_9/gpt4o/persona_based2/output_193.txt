Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  22  58  18  35  80  94  70  93
1  25  42  50  61  95  10  45  23   7
2  55  24  14  81  55  21  76   9  84
3   7  10  80  22  41  58  59  86  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations, one approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "round-robin" method or a similar heuristic where agents take turns picking their most valued item that is still available. This ensures that each agent gets a chance to receive items they value highly.

Let's go through the process:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the most (value 94). Allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (value 95). Allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 8 the most (value 84). Allocate item 8 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the most (value 86). Allocate item 7 to agent 3.

After the first round, the remaining items are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5.

5. Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 8, but it is already taken. The next available is item 5 (value 80). Allocate item 5 to agent 0.
6. Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 2 (value 50). Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
7. Agent 2's next highest valued item is item 6, but it is taken. The next available is item 0 (value 55). Allocate item 0 to agent 2.
8. Agent 3's next highest valued item is item 2, but it is taken. The next available is item 3 (value 22). Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

The remaining items are 1 and 4.

9. Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 2, but it is taken. The next available is item 1 (value 22). Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

10. Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 0, but it is taken. The next available is item 4 (value 95), but it is taken. No remaining items for agent 1.

Now all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [8, 0],
    "3": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations.
