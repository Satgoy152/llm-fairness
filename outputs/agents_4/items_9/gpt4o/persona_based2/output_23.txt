Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  56  26  56  88  30  95  81  64
1  89  92  17  47  23   5  64  78  14
2  11  53  11  98  62   9  24  26  40
3  28  64   3  90  85  48  18  55  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. This is an NP-hard problem, so finding an absolutely perfect solution is often impractical for larger sets, but we can attempt a best-effort approach. Given the valuation matrix, here's a suggested allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Start by giving agents their most valued items.
2. **Balance Remaining Items:** Distribute remaining items to balance the total value for each agent, ensuring no agent is envious of another's allocation.

Let's proceed with this heuristic approach:

- **Agent 0**: Highly values items 0, 6, 4, and 1. Let's allocate items 0 and 6 to Agent 0 (value 98 + 95 = 193).
- **Agent 1**: Highly values item 1 and 7. Let's allocate items 1 and 7 to Agent 1 (value 92 + 78 = 170).
- **Agent 2**: Highly values item 3. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 98).
- **Agent 3**: Highly values items 3 and 4, but item 3 is already taken, so allocate item 4. Allocate also item 5 to add some value (value 85 + 48 = 133).

Now we have allocated items: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The remaining items (2 and 8) need to be distributed to balance values.

- **Remaining Items**: 
  - **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 26), total value now 219.
  - **Item 8**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 40), total value now 138.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 6, 2] with total value 219.
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 7] with total value 170.
- **Agent 2**: Items [3, 8] with total value 138.
- **Agent 3**: Items [4, 5] with total value 133.

Now, providing this allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 2],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving agents their most valued items while balancing the total perceived value they each receive.
