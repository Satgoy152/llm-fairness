Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  74   1  14  64  43  31  56  95
1  43  57  61  27  90  81  33  48  49
2   5  18  23  60  38   3  81  25  98
3  84  30  31  64  14  24   9  42  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in such a way that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, let's try to distribute the items as fairly as possible.

To achieve this, we can use a round-robin allocation based on each agent's highest valuation for the remaining items. This method is not guaranteed to be envy-free, but it provides a practical approach to dividing items fairly.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value for item 8 (95).
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for item 4 (90).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for item 8 (98), but it's taken.
   - Next highest for item 6 (81).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value for item 0 (84).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Continue the process for the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value for item 1 (74).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for item 5 (81).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for item 2 (23).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value for item 3 (64).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

9. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining item 7 (25) is left.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 2.

Now all items are allocated, and the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6, 2, 7],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has an integer number of items, and all 9 items have been assigned.
