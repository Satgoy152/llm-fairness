Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  72  61  25  18  27  37  86  91
1  61  76  79  79  84  91  96  65   1
2  83  10  93  42  88   3  90  91  94
3  84  86  74  20  35  45  50  28  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an approach that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their individual valuations.

Let's implement a simple allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuations**: For each item, identify which agent values it the most. This will provide a starting point for a fair allocation.
2. **Allocate Items**: Begin by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If any agent ends up with no items, or if adjustments are needed to ensure each agent feels they have a fair share, reallocate items to balance the perceived fairness.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 84.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 72.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 93.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 79.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 88.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
- **Item 8**: Agent 3 values it the most at 98.

Initial allocation based on maximum valuations:
- Agent 0: [1, 7]
- Agent 1: [3, 5, 6]
- Agent 2: [2, 4]
- Agent 3: [0, 8]

Now, let's ensure that the allocations are balanced and consider any potential adjustments:

- All agents have received items, and the total number of items allocated is 9, satisfying the condition.
- The allocation gives two items to Agent 0 and Agent 3, three items to Agent 1, and two items to Agent 2.

This allocation aims to provide a fair distribution based on the initial maximum valuation approach. Since each agent has received items they value highly, this allocation is a reasonable attempt to achieve envy-freeness.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0, 8]
}
```
