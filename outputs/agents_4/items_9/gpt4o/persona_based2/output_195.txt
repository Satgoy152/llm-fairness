Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  66   0   9  77  34  51  12  46
1  14  74  71  81   5  22  31  44  40
2  32  11  76  63   6  65  68  75  92
3  53   2  96  45  48  27  18  41  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to balance the valuation each agent places on their assigned items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:** Determine the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their preferences.
2. **Initial Allocation:** Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation each agent has for an item that hasn't been allocated yet.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Adjust allocations to ensure that each agent has a fair share relative to others, trying to minimize envy.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation

- **Agent 0:** 49 + 66 + 0 + 9 + 77 + 34 + 51 + 12 + 46 = 344
- **Agent 1:** 14 + 74 + 71 + 81 + 5 + 22 + 31 + 44 + 40 = 382
- **Agent 2:** 32 + 11 + 76 + 63 + 6 + 65 + 68 + 75 + 92 = 488
- **Agent 3:** 53 + 2 + 96 + 45 + 48 + 27 + 18 + 41 + 27 = 357

### Step 2: Initial Allocation

Allocate items based on highest preference:

- **Agent 0:** Item 4 (77)
- **Agent 1:** Item 3 (81)
- **Agent 2:** Item 8 (92)
- **Agent 3:** Item 2 (96)

### Step 3: Adjust for Fairness

Next, we assign the remaining items by considering each agent's remaining top preferences:

- **Agent 0:** Already has item 4. Next highest: Item 1 (66), Item 6 (51)
- **Agent 1:** Already has item 3. Next highest: Item 1 (74)
- **Agent 2:** Already has item 8. Next highest: Item 7 (75), Item 6 (68)
- **Agent 3:** Already has item 2. Next highest: Item 0 (53)

Allocate remaining items:
- **Agent 0:** Item 1 (66), Item 6 (51)
- **Agent 1:** Item 5 (22)
- **Agent 2:** Item 7 (75)
- **Agent 3:** Item 0 (53)

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [8, 7],
    "3": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their preferences.
