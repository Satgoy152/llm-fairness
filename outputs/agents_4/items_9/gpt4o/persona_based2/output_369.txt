Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  66  49   7  74  34  51  17  56
1  57  95  91  90  82  47  72  86  59
2   3  66  10  80  33   2  45  31  18
3  53  21  16  98  12  94  56  49  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a greedy allocation method. We start by giving each agent their most valued item, and then proceed by allocating remaining items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Allocation (Most Valued Items for Each Agent):**

   - Agent 0: Values item 0 the highest at 95.
   - Agent 1: Values item 1 the highest at 95.
   - Agent 2: Values item 3 the highest at 80.
   - Agent 3: Values item 3 the highest at 98 (but item 3 is already allocated to Agent 2, so we consider the next highest which is item 5 at 94).

2. **Remaining Items Allocation:**

   After the initial allocation, we have allocated items: 0, 1, 3, and 5. The remaining items are: 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest among remaining items at 91.
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest among remaining items at 74.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the highest among remaining items at 86.
   - Agent 3 values item 6 the highest among remaining items at 56.
   - Agent 0 values item 8 the highest among remaining items at 56.

3. **Final Allocation:**

   We will ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9 by assigning leftover items to agents with the least total value so far, ensuring each agent ends up with a fair share. 

   - Agent 0: Items [0, 4, 8]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 7]
   - Agent 2: Items [3]
   - Agent 3: Items [5, 6]

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
