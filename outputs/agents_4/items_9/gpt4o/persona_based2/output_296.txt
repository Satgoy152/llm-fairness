Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  79  40  18  32  61  96  62   2
1  13  84  85  43   9  15  89  42  27
2  99  80  56  43  21  25  56  52  43
3  31  86  95  73  10  88  97  50   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility (or valuations) for each agent. This approach aims to ensure that each agent receives a fair share and minimizes envy among them. Given the valuations in the table, we will attempt to allocate items to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's first look at the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 91 + 79 + 40 + 18 + 32 + 61 + 96 + 62 + 2 = 481
- Agent 1: 13 + 84 + 85 + 43 + 9 + 15 + 89 + 42 + 27 = 407
- Agent 2: 99 + 80 + 56 + 43 + 21 + 25 + 56 + 52 + 43 = 475
- Agent 3: 31 + 86 + 95 + 73 + 10 + 88 + 97 + 50 + 3 = 533

Given these total valuations, we need to allocate the items such that the distribution is as fair as possible. A common approach is to use an algorithm like round-robin or divide-and-choose, but here we will attempt a heuristic approach to balance the allocations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Allocate the highest-valued items to agents who value them the most while ensuring overall fairness.
2. **Consider Total Value**: Ensure that the total value each agent receives is balanced.
3. **Iterate for Balance**: Adjust the allocation iteratively to minimize envy and increase fairness.

### Proposed Allocation:

After considering the valuations and ensuring that each agent receives a fair share, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [6, 0] → Values: 96, 91 (Total: 187)
- Agent 1: [2, 1] → Values: 85, 84 (Total: 169)
- Agent 2: [8, 3, 4] → Values: 43, 43, 21 (Total: 107)
- Agent 3: [5, 7] → Values: 88, 50 (Total: 138)

Each agent receives a balanced distribution based on their preferences, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [8, 3, 4],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives according to their preferences while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.
