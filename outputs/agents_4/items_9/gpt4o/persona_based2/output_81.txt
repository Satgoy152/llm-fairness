Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  89  50  72  37  81   5  69  29
1  15  68  17  86  53  44   1  21  70
2  88  81  35  27  41  72   9  47  73
3  43  97  34  28  33  49  81  40  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of another agent to their own, based on their valuations. Given the constraints of integer item allocations, perfect envy-freeness may not be possible, but we can strive for a fair and balanced distribution.

We first need to calculate the total value that each agent assigns to all items and attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share of total value. The total valuation for each agent is:

- Agent 0: 49 + 89 + 50 + 72 + 37 + 81 + 5 + 69 + 29 = 481
- Agent 1: 15 + 68 + 17 + 86 + 53 + 44 + 1 + 21 + 70 = 375
- Agent 2: 88 + 81 + 35 + 27 + 41 + 72 + 9 + 47 + 73 = 473
- Agent 3: 43 + 97 + 34 + 28 + 33 + 49 + 81 + 40 + 86 = 491

The total value of all items across all agents is the sum of one row (e.g., for agent 0): 481.

The fair share for each agent, assuming perfect divisibility, would be 481/4 = 120.25.

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with highest valuation to Agent 0. Items: [1, 5, 3] with valuations [89, 81, 72]. Total = 242.
2. **Agent 1**: Next, prioritize items with highest valuation for Agent 1. Items: [3, 8, 4] with valuations [86, 70, 53]. Total = 209.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items with highest preferences for Agent 2. Items: [0, 5, 8] with valuations [88, 72, 73]. Total = 233.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items with highest preferences for Agent 3. Items: [1, 7, 8] with valuations [97, 40, 86]. Total = 223.

We observe overlap and need to adjust to ensure each item is allocated only once.

Let's make the final allocations:

- Agent 0: [5, 0] (Total value = 81 + 49 = 130)
- Agent 1: [3, 4] (Total value = 86 + 53 = 139)
- Agent 2: [8, 6] (Total value = 73 + 9 = 82)
- Agent 3: [1, 2, 7] (Total value = 97 + 34 + 40 = 171)

This allocation may not be perfectly envy-free due to the constraints of integer distributions, but it attempts to balance the total valuations as equitably as possible.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [8, 6],
    "3": [1, 2, 7]
}
```
