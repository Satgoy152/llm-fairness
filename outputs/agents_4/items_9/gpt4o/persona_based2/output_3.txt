Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  13  42  30   3  84  39  73  91
1  63   6  88  52  39  78  55  16  68
2  83  86  26  75  13  47  58  55  12
3  18  37  56  14  91  31  59  83   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate these items among the four agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and aim for envy-freeness, if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's evaluate the valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Valuations Table:**
   - Agent 0: [57, 13, 42, 30, 3, 84, 39, 73, 91]
   - Agent 1: [63, 6, 88, 52, 39, 78, 55, 16, 68]
   - Agent 2: [83, 86, 26, 75, 13, 47, 58, 55, 12]
   - Agent 3: [18, 37, 56, 14, 91, 31, 59, 83, 2]

2. **Heuristic Allocation Strategy:**
   - We can try to allocate items by maximizing each agent's satisfaction from their top-valued items while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Assign each agent their top-valued items that haven't been claimed by another agent.
   - If conflicts arise (two agents value an item highly), consider the next best option for one of the agents.

**Allocations:**

- Agent 0 values item 8 the highest (91), so we assign item 8 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (88), so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (86), so we assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (91), so we assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, let's continue allocating the remaining items:

- Agent 0's next highest value is item 5 (84), assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1's next highest value is item 5 (78), but it's already taken by Agent 0. The next highest available is item 3 (52), assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2's next highest available is item 0 (83), assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3's next highest available is item 7 (83), assign item 7 to Agent 3.

Finally, allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 6 (39).
- The only remaining item is item 9, which is not in the list, so we must re-evaluate.

Re-adjusting allocations to include all items properly:

- Agent 0: [8, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 3]
- Agent 2: [1, 0]
- Agent 3: [4, 7]

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [8, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
