Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  92  21  98  93  55  46   1  94
1  92  61  61  55   2  77  96  39  34
2  48  79  84  98  28  74  63  41  51
3  37  84  29  92  77  15  61   9  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents, we will try to allocate items such that each agent gets an equal or nearly equal share of their total valuations. The aim is to make each agent feel that their share is equitable.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 65 + 92 + 21 + 98 + 93 + 55 + 46 + 1 + 94 = 565
- Agent 1: 92 + 61 + 61 + 55 + 2 + 77 + 96 + 39 + 34 = 517
- Agent 2: 48 + 79 + 84 + 98 + 28 + 74 + 63 + 41 + 51 = 566
- Agent 3: 37 + 84 + 29 + 92 + 77 + 15 + 61 + 9 + 78 = 482

Now, we'll distribute the items to try and balance the perceived value for each agent. We'll start by allocating the items that have the highest relative value for each agent compared to other agents.

1. Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (highest for agent 0).
2. Allocate item 0 to agent 1 (highest for agent 1).
3. Allocate item 5 to agent 2 (high value for agent 2).
4. Allocate item 4 to agent 3 (highest for agent 3).
5. Allocate item 1 to agent 0 (second highest relative for agent 0).
6. Allocate item 6 to agent 2 (second highest relative for agent 2).
7. Allocate item 7 to agent 1 (decent value for agent 1).
8. Allocate item 2 to agent 3 (better fit for agent 3).
9. Allocate item 8 to agent 0 (better fit for agent 0).

The allocations are made in a manner to try and balance the total valuation each agent feels they have received. After considering the allocations and checking for fairness, we have:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 8],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```

This assignment attempts to equalize the perceived value distribution among the agents based on their individual valuations of the items.
