Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  43  75  66  17  91  74  86  95
1  65  80  99  79  77   4  79  30  55
2  12  96  51  78  39   8  79  61  42
3  71   2   1  12  95  46  68  64  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair and envy-free allocation of items among the agents, we can apply the concept of maximizing social welfare based on the given valuations. This involves assigning items to agents in such a way that the total valuation for all agents is maximized, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Start by ranking items according to their highest valuation across all agents. This can help ensure that items are assigned to the agents who value them the most.

2. **Assign High-Value Items:** Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuation. This means giving each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Check for Fairness:** Ensure that each agent gets a fair share of items, and try to balance the total value across agents as much as possible.

4. **Reallocate if Necessary:** If an allocation is not balanced or if an agent receives no items, reallocate some items to ensure everyone gets at least one item and the total value is balanced.

Let's perform the allocation step-by-step:

- **Item 0:** Valued highest by Agent 1 (65).
- **Item 1:** Valued highest by Agent 2 (96).
- **Item 2:** Valued highest by Agent 1 (99).
- **Item 3:** Valued highest by Agent 2 (78).
- **Item 4:** Valued highest by Agent 0 (17).
- **Item 5:** Valued highest by Agent 0 (91).
- **Item 6:** Valued highest by Agent 0 (74).
- **Item 7:** Valued highest by Agent 0 (86).
- **Item 8:** Valued highest by Agent 0 (95).

Now, we will adjust the allocation to ensure fairness and that each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Assign items based on the maximum value each agent places on them, ensuring each agent receives a reasonable number of items.
- Ensure each agent gets at least one item.

After performing these steps, we arrive at the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the assignments are made according to the agents' highest valuations for each item.
