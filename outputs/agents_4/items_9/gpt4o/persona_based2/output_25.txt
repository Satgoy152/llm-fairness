Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  69  96  52  96  10  14  75  44
1  94   8   5  41  60  33  39  16  80
2  34  89  33  26  91  27  90  74  44
3  37  75   1  31  87  69  26  65  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among 4 agents with respect to their valuations, we aim to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that they received the best possible allocation given their valuation of the items.

First, let's evaluate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 26 + 69 + 96 + 52 + 96 + 10 + 14 + 75 + 44 = 482
- Agent 1: 94 + 8 + 5 + 41 + 60 + 33 + 39 + 16 + 80 = 376
- Agent 2: 34 + 89 + 33 + 26 + 91 + 27 + 90 + 74 + 44 = 508
- Agent 3: 37 + 75 + 1 + 31 + 87 + 69 + 26 + 65 + 35 = 426

Now, let's consider allocating items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation. We'll aim for allocations that minimize envy and distribute the total valuation fairly.

1. **Agent 0**: High preference for items 2 and 4.
    - Assign items: 2, 4
2. **Agent 1**: High preference for items 0 and 8.
    - Assign items: 0, 8
3. **Agent 2**: High preference for items 1 and 6.
    - Assign items: 1, 6
4. **Agent 3**: High preference for items 3, 5, and 7.
    - Assign items: 3, 5, 7

This allocation strategy aims to give each agent the items they value highly, thereby reducing potential envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 5, 7]
}
```

This ensures that all 9 items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, adhering to the requirements.
