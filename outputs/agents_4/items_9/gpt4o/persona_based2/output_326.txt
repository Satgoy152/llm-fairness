Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  98  18   2  50  10  83  98  66
1  92  51  87  23  17  58  55  86   8
2   8  92   3  28  31  17  34  97  43
3  43  28  24  69  27  72  39  45  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

The strategy involves evaluating each agent's preferences and allocating items in a way that maximizes their perceived value while minimizing envy among agents. We'll proceed by considering each agent's highest-valued items and try to distribute them equitably.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. **Identify each agent's preferences**: We will look at the valuation table and identify the top-valued items for each agent.

2. **Allocate high-value items first**: Start by giving each agent their highest-valued item, and then proceed to allocate subsequent items based on remaining preferences and availability.

3. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item**: Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, but we will aim to distribute items such that no agent feels left out.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0**: Values items 1 (98) and 7 (98) the most. We will allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 (92) the most. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 7 (97) the most. Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 5 (72) the most. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, distribute remaining items based on their next best preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Next best is item 6 (83). Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Next best is item 2 (87). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 8 (60) next. Allocate item 8 to Agent 3.
- **Remaining items**: Items 3 and 4.

Continue allocating based on available items:

- **Agent 2**: Next best available item is item 4 (31). Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 2**: The remaining item 3 is allocated to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4, 7],
    "3": [5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly while distributing the items as fairly as possible across agents.
