Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  59  93  23  58  72  94  64   7
1  17  12  59  46  20  64  87   1  61
2  77  29  36  58  53  12  54  76  24
3  52  85  75  84  41  84  97  82  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 4 agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation. Given the complexity of finding a perfectly envy-free division in all cases, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible.

### Steps to Allocate:

1. **List all items and their valuations for each agent.**
2. **Use a fair division method** such as the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item.
3. **Check the total number of items allocated** and ensure it's exactly 9.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value: 94)
   - Agent 1 picks item 8 (value: 61)
   - Agent 2 picks item 0 (value: 77)
   - Agent 3 picks item 6, but since it's taken, picks item 3 (value: 84)

2. **Round 2:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value: 93)
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value: 64)
   - Agent 2 picks item 7 (value: 76)
   - Agent 3 picks item 1 (value: 85)

3. **Round 3:**
   - Remaining items: 4
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value: 58)

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 4],
    "1": [8, 5],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. This allocation aims to minimize envy by allowing agents to pick items they value highly.
