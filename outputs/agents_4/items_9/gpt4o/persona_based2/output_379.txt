Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  85  79  47  35  32  91  26  22
1  28  77  28  64  76   3   9  12  90
2  58  49  34  74  90  48  46  50  10
3   2  72  93  64   5  66  74  14  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 85 79 47 35 32 91 26 22]
 [28 77 28 64 76  3  9 12 90]
 [58 49 34 74 90 48 46 50 10]
 [ 2 72 93 64  5 66 74 14 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own given their valuations.

### Valuation Analysis:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 and item 6 highly (99 and 91 respectively).
2. **Agent 1** values item 8 the most (90).
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (90).
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the most (93).

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 6, so it makes sense to allocate these items to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** should receive item 8, which they value the highest.
- **Agent 2** should receive item 4, which they value the highest.
- **Agent 3** should receive item 2, which they value the highest.

After allocating these high-value items, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 3, 5, 7) in a way that balances the total perceived value for each agent. We will consider secondary preferences and ensure that no agent is left with an undesirably low total value compared to others.

### Remaining Items Allocation:

- **Agent 0** can receive item 1 (value 85), which is their third-highest value item.
- **Agent 1** can receive item 3 (value 64), which they value reasonably well.
- **Agent 2** can receive item 5 (value 48), which is their next best-valued item.
- **Agent 3** can receive item 7 (value 14) to complete the allocation.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize individual agents' satisfaction based on their valuations and aims to minimize envy among agents. Each agent receives a reasonable allocation corresponding to their highest or near-highest valued items.
