Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  81  94  90  69  98  29  18  41
1  73  19  53  56   3  60  96  76  49
2  35  99  30   7  88  20   0  23  83
3  71  70  49   0  32   9  62  33  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can start by using the method of maximum marginal utility. This involves assigning items one by one to the agent who values them the most and ensuring that each agent gets a fair share. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive three items each.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Maximum Valuations:**
   - Look at each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most.
   
2. **Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 54.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest at 99.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 94.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 90.
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the highest at 88.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest at 98.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it the highest at 96.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it the highest at 76.
   - Item 8: Agent 2 values it the highest at 83.

3. **Adjust Allocation to Ensure Envy-Freeness:**
   - Each agent should ideally receive at least two items to ensure a fair distribution.
   - Reallocate items so that no agent receives more than three items.
   
4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Assign items to ensure a balanced and envy-free distribution.

Considering these guidelines, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 1: [6, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 4, 8]
- Agent 3: [3]

This distribution gives each agent a fair share, ensuring no agent envies another beyond what is reasonably possible given constraints.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 8],
    "3": [3]
}
```
