Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84   3   2  67  32  41  79  36  54
1  78  99   7   3  73  89  33   3  85
2  78  13  88  40  98  61  91   5  18
3  89  96  32  93  83  33  70  80  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly and with the goal of minimizing envy, we can use principles from fair division, such as maximizing each agent's utility based on their valuations. We need to make sure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items**: 0 (84), 6 (79), 3 (67)
2. **Agent 1's highest valued items**: 1 (99), 5 (89), 8 (85)
3. **Agent 2's highest valued items**: 4 (98), 6 (91), 2 (88)
4. **Agent 3's highest valued items**: 3 (93), 1 (96), 0 (89)

We aim to allocate items such that each agent gets the items they value the most, while also ensuring all 9 items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [0, 6] (Values: 84, 79)
2. **Agent 1**: Items [1, 5] (Values: 99, 89)
3. **Agent 2**: Items [4, 2] (Values: 98, 88)
4. **Agent 3**: Items [3, 7, 8] (Values: 93, 80, 43)

This allocation attempts to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [3, 7, 8]
}
```
