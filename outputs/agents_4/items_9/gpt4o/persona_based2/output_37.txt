Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  16  66  26  65  14  10  24  31
1  87  17  24  80  75  86  92  14  93
2  94  78  82  76  74   0  41  97  49
3  72  94  20  13  52  12   8  10  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the nature of these problems and the constraints, achieving perfect envy-freeness might be challenging, but we can strive for a fair allocation based on the total value each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations and make a strategic allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the most (66) and item 4 (65) next.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 8 the most (93) and item 6 (92) next.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most (94) and item 7 (97) next.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the most (94) and item 8 (76) next.

Given these preferences, we should try to allocate high-value items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring no agent strongly envies another's allocation.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 2 and 4 (valuations of 66 and 65).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 6 and 8 (valuations of 92 and 93).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 0 and 7 (valuations of 94 and 97).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 1, 3, and 5 (valuations of 94, 13, and 12).

This allocation ensures that:

- Each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation.
- Each agent gets an integer number of items.
- All items (0 to 8) are allocated.

Now, let's express this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives, reducing potential envy among the agents.
