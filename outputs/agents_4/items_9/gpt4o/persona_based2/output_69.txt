Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  70  29  52  93  64  41   9  41
1  84  13  20  76  89  54  96  20  56
2   8  21  68  60  75  44  74  61  23
3   8  30  65   9  90  66  10  64  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 30 65  9 90 66 10 64 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the adjusted winner procedure or a similar approach to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Given the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  70  29  52  93  64  41   9  41
1  84  13  20  76  89  54  96  20  56
2   8  21  68  60  75  44  74  61  23
3   8  30  65   9  90  66  10  64  87
```

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 4 (value 93) and item 1 (value 70).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 0 (value 84) and item 6 (value 96).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 2 (value 68) and item 6 (value 74), but item 6 is already prioritized by Agent 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 4 (value 90) but it's prioritized by Agent 0, so next best is item 8 (value 87).

Attempting to balance the allocation, we allocate items based on priority and try to maintain fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Allocated items [4, 1]
- **Agent 1**: Allocated items [0, 6]
- **Agent 2**: Allocated items [2, 5]
- **Agent 3**: Allocated items [3, 7, 8]

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences and valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 7, 8]
}
```
