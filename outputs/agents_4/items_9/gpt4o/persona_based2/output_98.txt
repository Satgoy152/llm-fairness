Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  39  48  39   0  86  56  20  96
1  78  14  14   0  42  49  98  14  53
2  75  79   6  86  53  84  45  26  26
3  65  54  76  94  82  34  76  30  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of any other agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations matrix, we will use the following approach:

1. **Initial Distribution**: Aim to give each agent a fair share of the total value based on their valuations.
2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Adjust allocations to minimize envy, ensuring each agent's allocation is as close to their fair share as possible.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 66 + 39 + 48 + 39 + 0 + 86 + 56 + 20 + 96 = 450
- Agent 1: 78 + 14 + 14 + 0 + 42 + 49 + 98 + 14 + 53 = 362
- Agent 2: 75 + 79 + 6 + 86 + 53 + 84 + 45 + 26 + 26 = 480
- Agent 3: 65 + 54 + 76 + 94 + 82 + 34 + 76 + 30 + 78 = 589

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 3** values item 3 highest (94) and no one else values it as highly. Give item 3 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 0** values item 8 highest (96). Give item 8 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 highest (79) and no one else values it as highly. Give item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 1** values item 6 highest (98) and no one else values it as highly. Give item 6 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 3** values item 4 second highest (82) and no one else values it as highly. Give item 4 to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 2** values item 5 second highest (84) and no one else values it as highly. Give item 5 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 0** values item 0 second highest (66) and no one else values it as highly. Give item 0 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 3** values item 2 third highest (76) and no one else values it as highly. Give item 2 to Agent 3.
9. Remaining item 7 is given to Agent 0, though Agent 3 values it, Agent 0 has fewer items.

Finally, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 4, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and distribute items based on agents' highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
