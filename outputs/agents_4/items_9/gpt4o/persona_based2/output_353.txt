Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  36   8  70  82  34   6  19  87
1  95  92  88  83  20   1  79  68  90
2  99  30  80  56  82  86  55  57  77
3  23  42  24  50  72   2  19  85  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the four agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item and try to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints.

Firstly, let's summarize the problem:
- We have 4 agents and 9 items.
- Each agent has a different valuation for each item.
- We aim to allocate all 9 items to the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the complexity of ensuring strict envy-freeness with integer allocations, a common approach is to use a heuristic or algorithmic strategy such as the "round robin" or "maximum envy reduction" method.

Here's a reasonable allocation using a heuristic method:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for items 4 and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 0 and item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 5 and item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent appreciates item 7 and item 3.

Following these considerations, a possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items: 4, 8
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 2
- Agent 2 receives items: 5, 6, 1
- Agent 3 receives items: 7, 3

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5, 6, 1],
    "3": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item based on their preferences. While it may not achieve perfect envy-freeness, it attempts to address the highest preferences of most agents.
