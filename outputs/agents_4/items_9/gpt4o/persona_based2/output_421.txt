Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  56  79  21  54   0  25  80  43
1  35  30  40  11  85  37  49  59  77
2  64  78  26  12  46  94  37  95   5
3  27  38   1  53  26  71  16  93  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we can use a method that seeks to ensure envy-freeness and fairness. One approach is the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item until all items are allocated. This method is simple and can help achieve a fair distribution.

Let's apply this method:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Each agent will take turns picking their highest-valued item that hasn't been taken yet.

2. **Round-Robin Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 56).
   - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 85).
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 94).
   - Agent 3 picks item 7 (value 93).

3. **Second Round**:
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 79).
   - Agent 1 picks item 8 (value 77).
   - Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 64).
   - Agent 3 picks item 6 (value 16).

4. **Third Round**:
   - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 21) since it is the only remaining item.

Now, each agent has received items based on their preferences, and all 9 items have been allocated. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [7, 6]
}
```
