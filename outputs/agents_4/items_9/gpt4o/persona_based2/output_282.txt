Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  41  88  54  23  77  20  81  45
1  23  93  21  45  71  30  73  35  61
2  12  84  55  64  22  92   1  19  87
3  25  55  55  20  57  23  33  22  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we can employ the following strategy. We'll try to allocate items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we aim for a solution that is as close as possible with the provided valuations.

First, let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 459
- Agent 1: 452
- Agent 2: 436
- Agent 3: 302

Given this, we aim to distribute items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their total valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly and that are not highly valued by others.
   - Item 2: 88
   - Item 5: 77
   - Item 7: 81

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly and that are not highly valued by others.
   - Item 1: 93
   - Item 4: 71

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly and that are not highly valued by others.
   - Item 3: 64
   - Item 8: 87

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that Agent 3 values highly and that are not highly valued by others.
   - Item 0: 25
   - Item 6: 33

This results in each agent receiving items that are generally of higher value to them, attempting to minimize envy as much as feasible with the given valuations.

Finally, hereâ€™s the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
