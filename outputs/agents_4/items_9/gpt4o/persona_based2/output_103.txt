Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  22  25  31   1  31  30  84  91
1  68  60  89  58  87  47  90  10  88
2  92  84   2   7  95  38  14  94  86
3  53   2  66  15  34  79  94  65  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can utilize a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation of their allocation.

Given the valuations provided, one common approach is to use the "round-robin" method. This involves agents taking turns selecting their most valued remaining item until all items are allocated. This strategy can help achieve envy-freeness under certain conditions.

Here is the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Chooses item 8 (value 91)
2. **Agent 1**: Chooses item 6 (value 90)
3. **Agent 2**: Chooses item 4 (value 95)
4. **Agent 3**: Chooses item 6 (already taken, chooses item 5 instead, value 79)
5. **Agent 0**: Chooses item 7 (value 84)
6. **Agent 1**: Chooses item 2 (value 89)
7. **Agent 2**: Chooses item 0 (value 92)
8. **Agent 3**: Chooses item 3 (value 15)
9. **Agent 0**: Chooses item 1 (value 22)

Let's finalize the allocations:

- Agent 0: [8, 7, 1]
- Agent 1: [6, 2]
- Agent 2: [4, 0]
- Agent 3: [5, 3]

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 7, 1],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```

Each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their valuation given the constraints, and all 9 items are allocated.
