Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  30  10  77  21  82  86  86  79
1  55  71  70   9  25  97  23  98  80
2  99  78  68  40  92  58  46  85  45
3  75  87  91  93  57  13  69  26  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll employ the concept of envy-freeness. A common approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin or a variant that considers the agents' preferences.

Given the valuations, we can proceed with a draft like approach where each agent picks the most valuable remaining item according to their valuation in a round-robin manner. This does not guarantee envy-freeness or Pareto optimality in all cases but can be a practical starting point for balanced allocations.

Let's follow a draft-style allocation:

1. **Agent 2** starts by selecting their highest-valued item, which is item 0 (value: 99).
2. **Agent 3** selects the next highest available item for them, which is item 3 (value: 93).
3. **Agent 1** selects item 7 (value: 98).
4. **Agent 0** selects item 6 (value: 86).

Now that each agent has picked one item, we continue in the same order:

5. **Agent 2** selects item 4 (value: 92).
6. **Agent 3** selects item 2 (value: 91).
7. **Agent 1** selects item 5 (value: 97).
8. **Agent 0** selects item 8 (value: 79).

Now, one item is left:

9. **Agent 0** selects item 1 (value: 30).

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items: 6, 8, 1
- Agent 1 gets items: 7, 5
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 4
- Agent 3 gets items: 3, 2

This allocation ensures every agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Below is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 1],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```
