Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  66   6  97  91  92  78  25   5
1  57   6  58  76  68  27  49  17  86
2  10  95  72  28  91  13  70   3  63
3   4  15  70  69  39  96   9  48  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider strategies for minimizing envy. One common approach is to use an algorithm that attempts to create an envy-free allocation. While it is not always possible to achieve perfect envy-freeness, we can attempt to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocation.

One such method is to use the "round-robin" procedure, which allows each agent to take turns picking their most preferred available item until all items are allocated. This method doesn't always guarantee envy-freeness but can often result in a reasonably fair division.

Let's go through a round-robin procedure with the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 3 (value 97).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 8 (value 86).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 1 (value 95).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 5 (value 96).
5. **Agent 0** picks item 4 (value 91).
6. **Agent 1** picks item 2 (value 58).
7. **Agent 2** picks item 6 (value 70).
8. **Agent 3** picks item 7 (value 48).
9. **Agent 0** picks item 0 (value 32).

This allocation gives each agent an opportunity to pick the highest-valued remaining item from their perspective in each round.

The allocations in the specified JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 0],
    "1": [8, 2],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item.
