Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  73  64  14  85  51  71  27  47
1  16  13  45  89  58  82  60  74  31
2  40  83  29  77  19  58  22   0  80
3  27  63  70  23  41  66  61  19  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and attempt to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy. Since we're dealing with integer allocations, each agent should ideally receive a comparable total value based on their individual valuations.

Below is one possible allocation that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0, 5, and 8
   - Total Value: 51 (Item 0) + 51 (Item 5) + 47 (Item 8) = 149

2. **Agent 1**: Items 3 and 6
   - Total Value: 89 (Item 3) + 60 (Item 6) = 149

3. **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 4
   - Total Value: 83 (Item 1) + 19 (Item 4) = 102

4. **Agent 3**: Items 2 and 7
   - Total Value: 70 (Item 2) + 19 (Item 7) = 89

This allocation aims to balance the total perceived value across agents, though it may not be perfectly envy-free due to the discrete nature of the problem. The goal is to minimize envy as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 8],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```
