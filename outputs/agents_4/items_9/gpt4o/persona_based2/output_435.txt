Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  19  57   3  56  95  14  25  82
1  61  17  81  40   5  49  41  22  10
2  75  54  28  26  74  89  47  33  74
3  94  83  26  75   9  89  30  56  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total value based on their valuations. One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item until all items are allocated. Let's apply this method here:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 95).
   - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 81).
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 89), but it's already taken, so they pick item 0 (value 75).
   - Agent 3 picks item 0 (value 94), but it's already taken, so they pick item 5 (value 89).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 8 (value 82).
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 61), but it's already taken, so they pick item 3 (value 40).
   - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 74).
   - Agent 3 picks item 1 (value 83).

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 57), but it's already taken, so they pick item 4 (value 56), but it's also taken, so they pick item 1 (value 19).
   - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 22).
   - Agent 2 picks item 8 (value 74), but it's already taken, so they pick item 6 (value 47).
   - Agent 3 picks item 7 (value 56), but it's already taken, so they pick item 3 (value 75), but it's also taken, so they pick item 6 (value 30).

4. **Round 4:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 3).
   - Agent 1 picks item 8 (value 10), but it's already taken, so they pick item 1 (value 17), but it's also taken, so they pick item 6 (value 41), but it's also taken, so they pick item 4 (value 5).
   - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 26), but it's already taken, so they pick item 7 (value 33).
   - Agent 3 picks item 2 (value 26), but it's already taken, so they pick item 4 (value 9), but it's also taken, so they pick item 8 (value 18).

Now, each agent has been assigned items, and all items have been allocated. The allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on the method used. Let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 7, 6, 4],
    "2": [0, 4, 7],
    "3": [1, 3, 6, 8]
}
```

Note: It is possible there are other allocations that are also fair and envy-free. The above solution is one way to distribute the items using a round-robin approach.
