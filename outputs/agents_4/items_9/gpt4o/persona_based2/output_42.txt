Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  24  49  57  36  96  47  89  39
1  10  77  56  30  18   1  95  78  51
2   7  14  54  94  98  88   8  86  61
3  41  61   1  71  31  92  39  16  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where ideally each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given that we have 9 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive around 2 to 3 items. 

We'll use a common approach called the "Round Robin" method, where agents take turns selecting their most valued remaining item. Here's a step-by-step procedure:

1. **Agent 0** chooses item 5 (value 96).
2. **Agent 1** chooses item 6 (value 95).
3. **Agent 2** chooses item 4 (value 98).
4. **Agent 3** chooses item 5 (value 92), but it's already taken, so chooses item 3 (value 71).

After the first round, we have:
- Agent 0: item 5
- Agent 1: item 6
- Agent 2: item 4
- Agent 3: item 3

Continue the allocation:

5. **Agent 0** chooses item 7 (value 89).
6. **Agent 1** chooses item 7 (value 78), but it's already taken, so chooses item 1 (value 77).
7. **Agent 2** chooses item 7 (value 86), but it's already taken, so chooses item 8 (value 61).
8. **Agent 3** chooses item 8 (value 62), but it's already taken, so chooses item 1 (value 61), but it's already taken, so chooses item 0 (value 41).

After the second round, we have:
- Agent 0: items 5, 7
- Agent 1: items 6, 1
- Agent 2: items 4, 8
- Agent 3: items 3, 0

Continue the allocation:

9. **Agent 0** chooses item 2 (value 49).

Final allocations are:
- Agent 0: items 5, 7, 2
- Agent 1: items 6, 1
- Agent 2: items 4, 8
- Agent 3: items 3, 0

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are distributed. 

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 2],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```
