Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  20  44  30  41  60  43  60  75
1  61  13  72   6  27  86  16  11  33
2  23  33  83  96  17  31  49  14  71
3  84  25   7  10  11  22   4  59  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A common approach is to use an algorithm like the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) or the Envy-Free procedure, but given the constraints, we'll aim for a simple allocation that balances the agents' valuations as evenly as possible.

Firstly, let's consider the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 463
- Agent 1: 325
- Agent 2: 417
- Agent 3: 295

To balance the allocations, we will try to distribute items in a way that each agent receives items that maximize their individual utility while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is equal to 9.

We will allocate items based on maximizing the individual agent's valuation for each item:

1. Start by allocating each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
2. Continue the process until all items are allocated and each agent has an integer number of items.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [4, 7]

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuation and all 9 items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
