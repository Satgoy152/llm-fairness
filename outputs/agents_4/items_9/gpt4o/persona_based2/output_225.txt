Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  88  31  68   6  39  23  48  70
1   3  66  58  76  43  70  53   4  16
2  99  87  27  15  74  12  43  52  84
3  60  48   0  61  39  67  65  34  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we can use a method aiming for envy-freeness, where each agent should prefer their own allocation over others. One approach is to use a round-robin selection process based on each agent's valuations. 

First, let's compute the total valuation each agent has for all items to prioritize their turns in the round-robin process:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 38 + 88 + 31 + 68 + 6 + 39 + 23 + 48 + 70 = 411
- Agent 1's total valuation: 3 + 66 + 58 + 76 + 43 + 70 + 53 + 4 + 16 = 389
- Agent 2's total valuation: 99 + 87 + 27 + 15 + 74 + 12 + 43 + 52 + 84 = 493
- Agent 3's total valuation: 60 + 48 + 0 + 61 + 39 + 67 + 65 + 34 + 70 = 444

Let's allocate the items using a round-robin selection with priority given to agents with the highest total valuation. We will start with Agent 2, then Agent 3, followed by Agent 0, and finally Agent 1.

**Round 1:**
1. Agent 2 picks item 0 (value = 99)
2. Agent 3 picks item 5 (value = 67)
3. Agent 0 picks item 1 (value = 88)
4. Agent 1 picks item 3 (value = 76)

**Round 2:**
1. Agent 2 picks item 8 (value = 84)
2. Agent 3 picks item 6 (value = 65)
3. Agent 0 picks item 7 (value = 48)
4. Agent 1 picks item 2 (value = 58)

**Round 3:**
1. Agent 2 picks item 4 (value = 74)

Now all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0, 8, 4],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
