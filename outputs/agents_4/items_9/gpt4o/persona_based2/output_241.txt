Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  40  25  46  73  71  50  89  57
1  10   6  97  75  11  80  55  78   7
2   1  84  15  93  47  55  10  67  63
3  37  87  20  24  81  91  59  30  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations. One method to achieve this is to use the "round-robin" approach, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 3** picks item 5 (value 91).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 2 (value 97).
3. **Agent 0** picks item 7 (value 89).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 4 (value 81).
5. **Agent 2** picks item 3 (value 93).
6. **Agent 0** picks item 8 (value 57).
7. **Agent 1** picks item 6 (value 55).
8. **Agent 3** picks item 1 (value 87).
9. **Agent 2** picks item 0 (value 1).

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [5, 4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while considering each agent's preferences to the extent possible within a simple framework.
