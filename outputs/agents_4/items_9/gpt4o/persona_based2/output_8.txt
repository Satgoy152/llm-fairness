Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  35  36  57  53   1  54  27  82
1  42  95  71  79  83  37  11  54  67
2  33  94   1  54  87  78  13  47  11
3  10  67  30  15  86  16  45  52   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can utilize a method that seeks to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. One such approach is to use the "Envy-Free Matching" method, which ensures each agent is as satisfied as possible given their preferences and the constraints.

Below is a strategy to allocate the items:

1. Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items to understand the relative preferences.
2. Use a heuristic to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring the division is fair.
3. Since we have only 9 items and 4 agents, some agents might receive fewer items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 8 (82) and also values items 6 (54) and 3 (57).
- Agent 1 places the highest value on item 1 (95) and also values item 4 (83) and item 3 (79).
- Agent 2 values item 4 (87) and item 5 (78) highly.
- Agent 3 values item 4 (86) and item 1 (67) highly.

We will attempt to assign items to agents such that their preferences are respected, and each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their satisfaction:

**Proposed Allocation:**
- Assign item 8 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 also values item 3 highly).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

This allocation tries to balance the values each agent places on the items while ensuring all 9 items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [8, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [7, 0]
}
```

This configuration ensures that each agent receives at least some of the items they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is precisely 9.
