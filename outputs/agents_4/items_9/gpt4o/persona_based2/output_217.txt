Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  26  67  74   7   2  64  24  71
1  52  32  96  21  92   3  54  60  52
2  26   6  74  53  25  10  41  37  90
3  34  25  74  51  66  37  23  11  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and an integer number of items per agent, we can utilize the method known as "round-robin" or "sequential allocation." This ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences in a manner that aims to minimize envy.

Here is a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Ranking the Items by Value**: Each agent ranks the items based on their valuations. For example, agent 0's ranking order of items based on descending valuations would be: [0, 3, 8, 2, 6, 1, 7, 4, 5].

2. **Round-robin Allocation**: We go in a round-robin manner, allowing each agent to pick their highest-valued available item in each round, until all items are allocated.

Let's execute this:

- **Round 1**:
  - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 75).
  - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 96).
  - Agent 2 picks item 8 (value 90).
  - Agent 3 picks item 4 (value 66).

- **Round 2**:
  - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 74).
  - Agent 1 picks item 4, but it's already taken, so picks item 1 (value 32).
  - Agent 2 picks item 2, but it's already taken, so picks item 6 (value 41).
  - Agent 3 picks item 3, but it's already taken, so picks item 0, but it's already taken, so picks item 5 (value 37).

- **Round 3**:
  - Agent 0 picks item 8, but it's already taken, so picks item 2, but it's already taken, so picks item 6 (value 64).
  - Agent 1 picks item 6, but it's already taken, so picks item 8, but it's already taken, so picks item 0, but it's already taken, so picks item 7 (value 60).
  - Agent 2 picks item 0, but it's already taken, so picks item 3, but it's already taken, so picks item 7, but it's already taken, so picks item 1 (value 6).
  - Agent 3 picks item 2, but it's already taken, so picks item 7, but it's already taken, so picks item 8, but it's already taken, so picks item 1, but it's already taken, so picks item 6, but it's already taken, so finally picks item 5, but it's already taken, so picks item 7, but already taken, finally picks item 1 (value 25).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 1, 7]
- Agent 2: [8, 6, 1]
- Agent 3: [4, 5]

Please note that this allocation method is heuristic and might not result in perfect envy-freeness, but it tries to minimize envy by allowing agents to pick their most valued available item in each round.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 1, 7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
