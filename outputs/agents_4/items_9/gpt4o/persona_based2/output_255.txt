Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  65   3   9  64  86  57  22  47
1  88  87  75  21   4  96  10  92  54
2  51  38  46   3  81   9  95  85  59
3  83  30   3  82  85   5  63  60  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. One approach to achieve this is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued available item.

First, we need to identify the most valued items for each agent and allocate them in such a way that the allocations are as balanced as possible. Since there are 9 items and 4 agents, each agent will get either 2 or 3 items.

Here's how the round-robin method can be applied to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1** starts by picking item 5 (value 96).
2. **Agent 0** picks item 5 (value 86).
3. **Agent 3** picks item 4 (value 85).
4. **Agent 2** picks item 4 (value 81).
5. **Agent 1** picks item 7 (value 92).
6. **Agent 0** picks item 1 (value 65).
7. **Agent 3** picks item 0 (value 83).
8. **Agent 2** picks item 6 (value 95).
9. **Agent 0** picks item 8 (value 47).

After these selections, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [1, 8]
- Agent 1: [5, 7]
- Agent 2: [4, 6]
- Agent 3: [0]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0]
}
```
