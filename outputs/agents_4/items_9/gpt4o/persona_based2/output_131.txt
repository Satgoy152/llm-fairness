Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  93  26  79  47  86  73  69   7
1  61  58  11  82   5   3  52  14  54
2  54  75  76  12  34  17   1  10  65
3  81  59  75  40  68  32  86   2  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness and integer allocations, we can use a simple round-robin method or a method like the maximum marginal utility approach. For simplicity, we can use a heuristic approach where we allocate items sequentially to maximize each agent's marginal utility at every step, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share.

Let's proceed with the maximum marginal utility approach:

1. **Initialize**: Start with no items allocated to any agent.

2. **Allocate Items**: Allocate each item to the agent for whom the item provides the highest marginal utility (i.e., the highest value).

3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's detail the allocation:

Initial setup:
- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: []

**Item allocations step-by-step:**

- **Item 0**: Values are [19, 61, 54, 81]. Highest value is 81 for Agent 3. Allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 1**: Values are [93, 58, 75, 59]. Highest value is 93 for Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Values are [26, 11, 76, 75]. Highest value is 76 for Agent 2. Allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Values are [79, 82, 12, 40]. Highest value is 82 for Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Values are [47, 5, 34, 68]. Highest value is 68 for Agent 3. Allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 5**: Values are [86, 3, 17, 32]. Highest value is 86 for Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Values are [73, 52, 1, 86]. Highest value is 86 for Agent 3. Allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 7**: Values are [69, 14, 10, 2]. Highest value is 69 for Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 8**: Values are [7, 54, 65, 62]. Highest value is 65 for Agent 2. Allocate to Agent 2.

After allocation, the distribution is:

- Agent 0: [1, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [2, 8]
- Agent 3: [0, 4, 6]

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
