Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  35  89   1  22  87  18  89  47
1  75  50  75  65  33  61  30   2  20
2  10  90  89  99  72  15  11  43  35
3  99   8  31  22  76   4  76  88  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the principle of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent to their own. Given the valuations provided, let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance fairness and envy-freeness.

First, let's consider each agent's valuation of the items:

- **Agent 0** values items highly at indices 2, 7, 5.
- **Agent 1** values items highly at indices 0, 2, 3.
- **Agent 2** values items highly at indices 3, 1, 2.
- **Agent 3** values items highly at indices 0, 8, 6.

We aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets an equitable share based on their preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Item 2 (89), Item 7 (89)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0 (75), Item 3 (65)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 1 (90), Item 4 (72)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 6 (76), Item 8 (49), Item 5 (4)

### Explanation:

- **Agent 0** receives items they value highly (2 and 7), which are among their top preferences.
- **Agent 1** receives item 0, which they value the most, and item 3, which is also highly valued by them.
- **Agent 2** receives item 1, which they value the most, and item 4, which they value highly.
- **Agent 3** receives items that maximize their total valuation given the remaining options.

This allocation attempts to give each agent their most valued items where possible, while ensuring all items are distributed and no agent envies the allocation of another, as each receives items they highly value.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [6, 8, 5]
}
```
