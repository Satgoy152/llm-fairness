Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  29  33  44  66   2  66   9  47
1  52  27  97  65  71  21  10  39  88
2  15  69  11  45  36  40  47  24   2
3  77  70  13  83  91  14  25  10  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents while considering fair division and attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we will use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's total perceived value of the items they receive. This strategy is akin to the "Maximum Nash Welfare" approach, which balances both efficiency and fairness.

### Valuations Matrix:
- Agent 0: [82, 29, 33, 44, 66, 2, 66, 9, 47]
- Agent 1: [52, 27, 97, 65, 71, 21, 10, 39, 88]
- Agent 2: [15, 69, 11, 45, 36, 40, 47, 24, 2]
- Agent 3: [77, 70, 13, 83, 91, 14, 25, 10, 42]

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Item 2** (Highest value for Agent 1, 97): Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 4** (Highest value for Agent 3, 91): Allocate to Agent 3.
3. **Item 3** (Next highest for Agent 3, 83): Allocate to Agent 3.
4. **Item 0** (Highest value for Agent 0, 82): Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 1** (Highest value for Agent 3, 70): Allocate to Agent 3.
6. **Item 8** (Highest value for Agent 1, 88): Allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6** (Highest value for Agent 0, 66): Allocate to Agent 0.
8. **Item 5** (Next highest for Agent 2, 40): Allocate to Agent 2.
9. **Item 7** (Next highest for Agent 1, 39): Allocate to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 8, 7
- Agent 2 receives items: 5
- Agent 3 receives items: 4, 3, 1

This allocation attempts to maximize the perceived value for each agent while still ensuring that every item is allocated.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 8, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 3, 1]
}
```

This allocation approach aims to provide a fair distribution of items, balancing the interests of each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
