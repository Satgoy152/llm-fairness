Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  73  97  78  94  78  42  88   0
1  63  91   7  57  30  67  68  55  53
2  61  68  72  99  43   5   8   9   2
3  59  90  79  13  47  46  92   6  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free, or as close as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

First, let's summarize the valuation matrix for each agent:

- Agent 0: [25, 73, 97, 78, 94, 78, 42, 88, 0]
- Agent 1: [63, 91, 7, 57, 30, 67, 68, 55, 53]
- Agent 2: [61, 68, 72, 99, 43, 5, 8, 9, 2]
- Agent 3: [59, 90, 79, 13, 47, 46, 92, 6, 30]

We'll attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring every item is allocated.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuation on items 2, 4, and 1. Assign items 2 and 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 and 0 very highly. Since item 1 is already taken, allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest. Assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the highest, so assign item 6 to agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items are 5, 7, and 8.
- Agent 1 and Agent 3 have received only one item each so far, while Agent 2 has received one.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (since they value it next highest after item 0).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 values it second highest after the already allocated items).
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 3 (as it maximizes their remaining value).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and we are trying to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences, given the constraints.
