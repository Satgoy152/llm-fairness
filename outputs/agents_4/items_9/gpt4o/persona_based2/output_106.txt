Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  37   8  10  72  34  29  23   6
1   2   8  36  77  58  56  58  25  15
2  84  88  18  74  58  16  61  58   3
3  75   7  35  69  64   2  39  87  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while achieving envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for their allocated items. We'll proceed by trying to assign items in a way that balances the total valuation across agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and then try to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

2. Assign items to agents based on their individual valuations, ensuring that we don't leave any agent with zero items unless necessary.

Based on the given valuations, here's an allocation that aims for fairness:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 7.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 8 and 2.

Here's an allocation that tries to balance the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 7
- Agent 3: Items 8, 2, 5

Let's see the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [8, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and we have distributed all 9 items fairly among the agents.
