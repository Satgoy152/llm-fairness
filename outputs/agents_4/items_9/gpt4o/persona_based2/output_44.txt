Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  18  15  54  26  99  89  55  82
1  40  35  65  85  85  31  85  99  24
2  81  10  28  99  43  20  71   9  95
3  81   2  53   0  26  20  34  34  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to achieve envy-freeness, ensuring each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation, or as close to this ideal as possible. We'll also ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the strategy used to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:** Each agent has preferences over the items, and we'll try to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly.

2. **Ensure all items are allocated:** We'll ensure that each item is assigned to one of the agents.

3. **Balance the allocations:** Try to balance the total value each agent receives in their allocation, keeping the envy-free criterion in mind.

Let's look at the table with the agents and their valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  18  15  54  26  99  89  55  82
1  40  35  65  85  85  31  85  99  24
2  81  10  28  99  43  20  71   9  95
3  81   2  53   0  26  20  34  34  60
```

**Allocation Strategy:**

- Start by allocating the highest valued items to agents who value them the most.
- Balance the number of items received by each agent, ensuring all items are allocated.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [5, 6] (values: 99, 89)
- Agent 1: Items [3, 7] (values: 85, 99)
- Agent 2: Items [0, 8] (values: 81, 95)
- Agent 3: Items [1, 2, 4] (values: 2, 53, 26)

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives a fair share:

- Agent 0 receives items with a total value of 188.
- Agent 1 receives items with a total value of 184.
- Agent 2 receives items with a total value of 176.
- Agent 3 receives items with a total value of 81.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
