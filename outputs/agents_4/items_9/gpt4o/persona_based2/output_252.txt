Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  19  25  59  89  11  65  53  15
1  96  77  23  74   6  98  38  36  98
2  87   4  62  93  75  24  39  99  34
3   4  20  38  20  70   7  27  78  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to strategically assign items based on their valuations. The goal is to minimize envy among agents by maximizing the sum of the assigned values to each agent.

We first look for combinations where an agent highly values certain items, aiming to balance the total value each agent receives as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by identifying which items have the highest valuations for each agent.

2. **Assign High-Value Items:** Prioritize assigning items to agents who value them the most.

3. **Balance Total Value:** Ensure that each agent's total valuation is balanced as per their preferences.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values item 0 (97).
- Agent 1 highly values items 5 (98) and 8 (98).
- Agent 2 highly values items 3 (93) and 7 (99).
- Agent 3 highly values items 8 (83) and 4 (70).

Keeping these preferences in mind, let's allocate the items:

1. **Assign to Agent 0:** Since Agent 0 highly values item 0, we assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Assign to Agent 1:** Assign items 5 and 8 to Agent 1. These items are highly valued at 98 each.

3. **Assign to Agent 2:** Assign items 3 and 7 to Agent 2. These items have high values of 93 and 99.

4. **Assign to Agent 3:** Assign items 4 to Agent 3, which is valued at 70.

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items 1, 2, and 6 remain unassigned. We need to allocate these while balancing values:
     - Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
     - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
     - Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

Now we have allocated all 9 items. Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [4, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets a reasonably fair share based on their preferences.
