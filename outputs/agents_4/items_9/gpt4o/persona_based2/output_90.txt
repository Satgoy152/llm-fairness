Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  42  27  96  42  70  87  57  50
1  36  71  73  29  22  36  29  47  72
2  50  65  68  23  52  76  53  31  96
3  10  68  63  40  26  45  57  50  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that aims to minimize envy, we can use a method such as the envy-free matching. However, given the constraints of integer allocations and the limited number of total items, perfect envy-freeness may not be achievable. Hence, we will focus on a solution that balances allocations based on the given valuations as best as possible.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve a reasonable allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuations:** Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations to ensure each agent gets the items they value most.

2. **Balance the allocations:** Ensure that each agent receives a similar number of items and that the allocations are as fair as possible in terms of total value received.

Based on the valuations provided, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (96) and item 6 (87).
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 (73) and item 8 (72).
- Agent 2 highly values item 8 (96) and item 5 (76).
- Agent 3 highly values item 8 (97) and item 1 (68).

Considering these preferences, we can make the following allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives items: 3, 6
2. Agent 1 receives items: 2, 8
3. Agent 2 receives items: 5, 7
4. Agent 3 receives items: 0, 1, 4

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Each agent receives a reasonable share of their valued items.
