Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  99  52  94   3  38  26
1  13  75  86  38  17  81  52
2  47  25  57  76  42  38  76
3  64  93  30  23  59  66  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations given and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their preferences. One approach is to use a greedy method where we assign items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's analyze the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 24     | 99     | 52     | 94     | 3      | 38     | 26     |
| 1     | 13     | 75     | 86     | 38     | 17     | 81     | 52     |
| 2     | 47     | 25     | 57     | 76     | 42     | 38     | 76     |
| 3     | 64     | 93     | 30     | 23     | 59     | 66     | 91     |

We can follow these steps to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item by reassigning items if necessary.
3. Ensure all 7 items are allocated.

Following these rules, here's how the allocation could be done:

- Item 0: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (64).
- Item 1: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (99).
- Item 2: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (86).
- Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (94).
- Item 4: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (59).
- Item 5: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (81).
- Item 6: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (91).

Now, let's make sure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 0, 4, 6

We'll reassign one item to Agent 2 from Agent 3 to ensure all agents get at least one item. Let's give Item 0 to Agent 2 since Agent 2 has the second-highest valuation for it (47).

Revised allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 4, 6

Now, all agents have at least one item. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
