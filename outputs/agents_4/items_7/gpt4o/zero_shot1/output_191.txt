Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  45  84  40   6  80  45
1  86  96  38  47  90  90  96
2  36  12  64  24  84  64   8
3  24  70   0  57   2  32  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 70  0 57  2 32 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy such as maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (91)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 6 (96)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (84)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (70)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 5) such that valuations are maximized and each agent gets at least one item, if possible:

5. **Agent 1** (Already has Item 6, potential high value items left):
   - Next highest value item: Item 5 (90)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 0** (Already has Item 0):
   - Next highest value item: Item 2 (84)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

7. **Agent 3** (Already has Item 1):
   - Allocate Item 3 (57) to Agent 3 (highest remaining value for Agent 3)

Now, all items are allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
