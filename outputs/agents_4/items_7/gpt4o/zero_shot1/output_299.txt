Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  42  95   4   4  54  64
1  64  82  55  92  17  13  89
2  27  95  95  74  12  33  70
3  22  80  66  15  68  58  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent could gain for each item and assign the items based on maximizing the overall utility for each agent. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the highest at 95.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the highest at 95.
3. Assign item 3 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it the highest at 92.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it at 54, and this is the highest remaining valuation.
5. Assign item 0 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it at 64, and this is the highest remaining valuation.
6. Assign item 6 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it at 89, and this is the highest remaining valuation.
7. Assign item 4 to agent 3 because agent 3 values it at 68, and this is the highest remaining valuation.

After this allocation, the items are distributed as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 3, and 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent has an integer number of items.
