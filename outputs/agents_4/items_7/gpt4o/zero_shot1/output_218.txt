Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  58  30   6   6  95  19
1   9  81  31  77  43  12  70
2   6  29  87  21  25  20  41
3  45  58   4  73  25   5  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a heuristic approach to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of value based on their preferences. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 5 (95)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (58)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (81)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (77)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (87)
   - Next highest: Item 6 (41)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: Item 3 (73)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (45)

Considering these preferences, we should try to allocate items starting with each agent's highest valued items, then adjust to ensure all items are allocated:

- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3

Now, allocate the remaining items (0, 4, and 6):

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 3 (second highest value)
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value)
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest value)

This distribution ensures each agent gets at least one item, and items are allocated based on the highest preferences possible.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
