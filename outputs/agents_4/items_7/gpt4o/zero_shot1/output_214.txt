Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  43  19  68   2  27  97
1  25  83  52  62  69  43  75
2  58  77  64  46   1  36  67
3  19  92  37  10  91  37  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent is considered.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 (68) and 6 (97).
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 (83) the most.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (77) and item 0 (58).
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 (91) and item 1 (92) the most.

Considering the above valuations and aiming for a balanced allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 6, which has the highest valuation for this agent.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 1, which is highly valued by this agent.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 0, which is the highest valued item for this agent that hasn't been taken.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 4, which is highly valued and unique to this agent.

After assigning these items, we still have items 2, 3, and 5 remaining. We need to distribute these remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 3, the next highest available value for this agent.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 2, which is the next best available valuation for this agent.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 5, which is the next best available valuation for this agent.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
