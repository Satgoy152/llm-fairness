Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21   4  81  21  36  75  43
1  20  14  60  72  32  12  34
2   5  53  62  60  30  11  20
3  12  26  87  73  88  56  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High Value Items for Individual Agents:**
    - Agent 0 has a high value for item 2 (81).
    - Agent 3 has high values for items 2 (87), 3 (73), 4 (88), and 6 (86).
    - Agent 1 has a high value for item 3 (72).
    - Agent 2 has a high value for items 1 (53) and 2 (62).

2. **Assign High Value Items to Agents:**
    - Assign item 2 to Agent 3, since Agent 3 values it the most at 87, which is higher than Agent 0’s 81.
    - Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it is the highest value (72) for Agent 1.
    - Assign item 4 to Agent 3, since it has the highest value (88) for any agent.

3. **Continue Allocation by Prioritizing Remaining High Values:**
    - Assign item 1 to Agent 2, because it is the highest value for Agent 2 (53).
    - Assign item 6 to Agent 3, as it highly values it (86).

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
    - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, since it’s the highest value (21) for Agent 0.
    - Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has a relatively high value for it (75).

5. **Finalize the Allocation:**
    - All items are allocated, ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and no agent receives more than necessary.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
