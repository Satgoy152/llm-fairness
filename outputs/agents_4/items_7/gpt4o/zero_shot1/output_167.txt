Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  32  11  62  16  38   3
1  30  45   8  54   8  80  77
2  15   0  45  57  49  73  26
3  63  17   8  57  88  79  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider distributing the items in such a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is item 3 (62).
   - Second-highest is item 5 (38).
   - Third-highest is item 1 (32).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is item 5 (80).
   - Second-highest is item 6 (77).
   - Third-highest is item 3 (54).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is item 5 (73).
   - Second-highest is item 3 (57).
   - Third-highest is item 2 (45).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation is item 4 (88).
   - Second-highest is item 5 (79).
   - Third-highest is item 0 (63).

To allocate fairly while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 62).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (value 79).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 45).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 88).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 77).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 63).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 45).

This allocation tries to give each agent some of their higher-valued items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4, 5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
