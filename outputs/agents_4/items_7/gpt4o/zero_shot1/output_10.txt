Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  50   8  22  70  68  38
1  78  88  78  49  60  93  50
2  53  36  85  56  60  51  49
3  74  66  33  91   3  98  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 88 78 49 60 93 50]

 [74 66 33 91  3 98 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will use a simple greedy approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most**: This is a straightforward greedy method where each item is given to the agent who values it the most.

Let's evaluate each item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 at 78, Agent 2 at 53, and Agent 3 at 74. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 at 88, Agent 2 at 36, and Agent 3 at 66. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 at 78, Agent 2 at 85, and Agent 3 at 33. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 49, Agent 2 at 56, and Agent 3 at 91. Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 at 60, Agent 2 at 60, and Agent 3 at 3. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 at 93, Agent 2 at 51, and Agent 3 at 98. Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 at 50, Agent 2 at 49, and Agent 3 at 97. Assign to Agent 3.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3, 5, 6]

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
