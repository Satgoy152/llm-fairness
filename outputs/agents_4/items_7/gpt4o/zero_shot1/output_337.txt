Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  30  27  90  53  60  21
1  81  79  36  93   8  11  96
2  18  96  44  43   2  36  98
3  73  37  68  21  10  29  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56 30 27 90 53 60 21]
 [81 79 36 93  8 11 96]
 [18 96 44 43  2 36 98]
 [73 37 68 21 10 29 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations in the table, here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5. We can assign item 3 to Agent 0 to maximize their valuation.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0 and 3. Since item 3 is already taken, we can assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values items 1 and 6 the most. We can assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the most. We can assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 4, and 5) while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it more than the others.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, based on their relatively higher valuation for item 5 compared to the remaining options.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
