Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  29  80  21   3  26  55
1  38  51  42  42  12  92  23
2  21  58  15  25  79  37  41
3  20  54  76  27  71  55  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately the same total value of items, while ensuring all items are assigned and each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are four agents and seven items, this means that one agent will receive two items and the others will receive one item each.

To achieve this, we can follow a greedy approach, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that no agent receives more than two items and all items are distributed. Letâ€™s go through the allocation:

1. **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 1 with a value of 38.
2. **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 2 with a value of 58.
3. **Item 2** is most valued by Agent 0 with a value of 80.
4. **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 1 with a value of 42.
5. **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 2 with a value of 79.
6. **Item 5** is most valued by Agent 1 with a value of 92.
7. **Item 6** is most valued by Agent 3 with a value of 92.

After this initial assignment, we find that Agent 1 has been assigned three items (0, 3, 5), which exceeds the limit. To correct this, we need to reallocate one of these items to ensure fairness. We'll reallocate Item 3, since it's valued less by Agent 1 compared to Item 5.

Here's an allocation that ensures each agent gets a fair share:
- Agent 0 receives Item 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives Items 1 and 4.
- Agent 3 receives Items 3 and 6.

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has been assigned an integer number of items, with Agent 1 receiving two items and other agents receiving one item each.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
