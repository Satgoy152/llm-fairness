Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  76  97  88  45  88  42
1  71  94  69   1  57   7  91
2  35  19  31   5  77  57  92
3  57  12  55  75  72  39  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[14 76 97 88 45 88 42]
 [71 94 69  1 57  7 91]
 [35 19 31  5 77 57 92]
 [57 12 55 75 72 39 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations to maximize fairness or total utility. One way to approach this is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total value while ensuring every item is allocated.

Let's examine the table and allocate items:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 2, 3, and 5.
2. Agent 1 has high values for items 0, 1, and 6.
3. Agent 2 has high values for items 4, 5, and 6.
4. Agent 3 has high values for items 3 and 4.

Using these observations, we'll try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0: Allocate items [2, 5]. Total Value = 97 + 88 = 185
- Agent 1: Allocate items [0, 6]. Total Value = 71 + 91 = 162
- Agent 2: Allocate items [4]. Total Value = 77
- Agent 3: Allocate items [1, 3]. Total Value = 12 + 75 = 87

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all 7 items are allocated without exceeding the total number of items available.
