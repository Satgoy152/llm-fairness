Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  92  81  18  15  13  76
1  52  90  74  67   1  86  71
2  45  41  84   7  17  90  67
3  97  10  84  98  36  71  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 90 74 67  1 86 71]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent has for the items they receive. We will attempt to distribute the items while considering each agent's preferences and ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. We can allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highly. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highly. We can allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 0**: Since item 0 is allocated, we can allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as they also have a high valuation for it.
6. **Agent 1**: Since item 1 is allocated, we can allocate item 6 to Agent 1 as they also have a high valuation for it.
7. **Agent 3**: Has a relatively high valuation for item 4, and since item 3 is already allocated to them, we can allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

The allocation could look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed, respecting each agent's preferences as much as possible.
