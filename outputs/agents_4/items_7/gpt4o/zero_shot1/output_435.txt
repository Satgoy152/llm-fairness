Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  88  36  91  89  47  33
1  73  12  80  95  35  98  50
2  13  71  56  39  50   0   9
3  74  21  38  53   2  94  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[16 88 36 91 89 47 33]
 [73 12 80 95 35 98 50]
 [13 71 56 39 50  0  9]
 [74 21 38 53  2 94 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 4 agents and 7 items, at least three agents will receive 2 items each, and one agent will receive 1 item.

Let's examine the valuations to make a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (91), Item 4 (89)
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (98), Item 3 (95)
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (71), Item 4 (50)
4. **Agent 3's Valuations**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (99), Item 5 (94)

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 0**: Allocate Item 3 (91) and Item 4 (89) for maximum value.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate Item 5 (98) for maximum value. Then, considering remaining high values, allocate Item 2 (80).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate Item 1 (71) for maximum value. 
- **Agent 3**: Allocate Item 6 (99) and Item 0 (74) for maximum value.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items for which they have the highest valuation, and all items are distributed.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
