Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  87  94  72  10  75  25
1  20  18   0  12  47  35  80
2  43  89  11   0  56  79  13
3  94  21  39  72  11  20  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20 18  0 12 47 35 80]
 [43 89 11  0 56 79 13]
 [94 21 39 72 11 20 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We have 4 agents and 7 items, so we need to make sure each agent gets at least some items if possible, but not necessarily all agents will get an item due to the limited number.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (94), item 1 second-highest (87), and item 3 (72).
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (80), and item 4 next (47).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (89), and item 5 next (79).
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (94), and item 3 next (72).

A fair allocation based on maximizing the value for each agent could be:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 94).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 80).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 79).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 94).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 89).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 47).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 72).

Now let's represent this allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items based on their highest preferences while ensuring all 7 items are distributed.
