Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  57  86  48  93  33   9
1  62  58  52  84  53  69  41
2  83  79  98  92  75  38  54
3  72  94  96  20  26  35  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 57 86 48 93 33  9]
 [62 58 52 84 53 69 41]
 [83 79 98 92 75 38 54]
 [72 94 96 20 26 35 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (value: 93).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (value: 84).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (value: 98).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (value: 94).

After allocating the highest valued items for each agent, we distribute the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 0, 5, 6
- We continue by allocating the next highest preference of agents who haven't received a second item.

5. **Agent 0**: 
   - Second highest available valuation is for item 0 (value: 63).

6. **Agent 3**: 
   - Second highest available valuation is for item 5 (value: 35).

7. **Agent 2**: 
   - Third highest available valuation is for item 6 (value: 54).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes their total valuation based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
