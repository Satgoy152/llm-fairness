Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  24  21  75  34  67  86
1  45  92  15  48  56   0  30
2  61  66  26  75  68  90  85
3   3  10  48   4  79  25   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to find an allocation:

1. **Initial Considerations**: Each agent should receive at least one item if possible, and we must allocate all 7 items.

2. **Identify High Value Items**: Look at the highest value items for each agent to maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Iterative Assignment**: Allocate items based on the highest available value for each agent, adjusting if necessary to ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item where possible.

Let's go through the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 3, 6, and 5.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 5 and 3.
- Agent 3 has a high value for item 4.

Let's attempt to allocate based on these observations:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest available value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest available value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest available value for Agent 3).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest remaining value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest remaining value for Agent 1).

Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.
