Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  91  99  34  94   3  47
1   7  71  46  66  84  33  27
2  39  56  29  64  17  73   6
3  60   6  17  11  78  35  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that considers each agent's valuations and attempts to maximize the total satisfaction. We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and the allocations are balanced among the agents. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values are: [43, 91, 99, 34, 94, 3, 47]
   - Highest value is for item 2 (99).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values are: [7, 71, 46, 66, 84, 33, 27]
   - Highest value is for item 4 (84), but item 4 could also be valuable to other agents. Let's check next highest.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 since it has the highest value for this agent.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values are: [39, 56, 29, 64, 17, 73, 6]
   - Highest value is for item 5 (73).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values are: [60, 6, 17, 11, 78, 35, 73]
   - Highest value is for item 0 (60), but next highest is item 6 (73).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 0, 1, 3
- Agent 0 could benefit from item 1 (91).
- Agent 1 could benefit from item 3 (66).
- Agent 2 can take item 0 (39).

With these allocations in mind, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items, aims to optimize agent satisfaction, and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items.
