Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  63  32  86  46   0  21
1  52  47  89  38   6  25  74
2  46  69  95   4  81  94  68
3   0  22  52  87  68   5   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, as there are 7 items and 4 agents. Let's consider maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 3 (value 86)
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 2 (value 89)
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 5 (value 94)
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 2

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value: Item 3 (value 87), but it's already allocated
   - Next highest value: Item 2 (value 52), but it's already allocated
   - Next highest value: Item 4 (value 68)
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 3

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (0, 1, 6):

5. **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest available value: Item 1 (value 63)
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0

6. **Agent 1**: 
   - Next highest available value: Item 6 (value 74)
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 1

7. **Agent 2**: 
   - Next highest available value: Item 0 (value 46)
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
