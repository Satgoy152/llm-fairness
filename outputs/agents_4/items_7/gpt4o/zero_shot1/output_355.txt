Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  50  91  33  46  47  45
1  19  19  33  42  35  89  91
2   6   3  46  29   1  13  40
3   8  82  60  21  17  36   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44 50 91 33 46 47 45]
 [19 19 33 42 35 89 91]
 [ 6  3 46 29  1 13 40]
 [ 8 82 60 21 17 36  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. This can be done by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, but trying to balance it so that each agent gets a fair share.

Let's follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (91), Item 1 (50), Item 5 (47)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (91), Item 5 (89), Item 3 (42)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (46), Item 6 (40), Item 3 (29)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (82), Item 2 (60), Item 5 (36)

Now allocate based on these valuations:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, since they value it the most (91).
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1, as they have the highest value for it (91).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3, who values it highly (82).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1, who values it second highest (42).
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0, who has the next highest valuation for it (47).
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the next best option for them (44).
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1, who values it more than the others available for allocation (35).

Given these allocations, each agent will have a balanced allocation based on their preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1]
}
```
