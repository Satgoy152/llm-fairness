Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  40  58  15  68  31  95
1  62  41  39  92  45  34  14
2  76  58  83  61  84   3   1
3  30  60  64  93  50  11  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's happiness by focusing on their highest-valued items, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. We need to ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Let's go through the process to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (95). Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 3 (93). Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (84). Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 2** also has a high valuation for item 2 (83). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 (92), but it is already taken. Next, they value item 0 (62). Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 0 (85), but it is already taken by Agent 1. Their next highest is item 2 (58), but it is taken by Agent 2. Next, they value item 1 (40). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 3** has the next highest valuation for item 2 (64), but it is already taken by Agent 2. Next, they value item 1 (60), which is taken by Agent 0. Next, they value item 4 (50). Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest available valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
