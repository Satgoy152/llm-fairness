Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53   3  22  50  24  87  69
1  99  92  17  78  79  59  72
2  22  37  19  32  13  33  97
3  91  17  92  29  60  18  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53  3 22 50 24 87 69]
 [99 92 17 78 79 59 72]
 [22 37 19 32 13 33 97]
 [91 17 92 29 60 18 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive 1 item, and others will receive 2 items.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 3, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 0, 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 has high values for item 6.
- Agent 3 has high values for items 0, 2, and 4.

We can try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. Agent 0: Allocate items 5 and 6.
   - Values: 87 and 69 (total = 156)

2. Agent 1: Allocate items 0 and 4.
   - Values: 99 and 79 (total = 178)

3. Agent 2: Allocate item 3.
   - Value: 32

4. Agent 3: Allocate items 1 and 2.
   - Values: 17 and 92 (total = 109)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable total value from their assigned items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
