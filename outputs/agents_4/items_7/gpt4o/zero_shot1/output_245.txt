Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  81  95  30  98  84  60
1   2  71  62  21  39  63  74
2  49  27   7  52  74  65   3
3  96  13   0  37  18  31  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 81 95 30 98 84 60]
 [ 2 71 62 21 39 63 74]
 [49 27  7 52 74 65  3]
 [96 13  0 37 18 31 85]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a simple strategy that aims to maximize the total valuations for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the allocations are spread reasonably.

First, let's examine the highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Highest valuations are 99 (Item 0), 98 (Item 4), 95 (Item 2)
- Agent 1: Highest valuations are 74 (Item 6), 71 (Item 1), 63 (Item 5)
- Agent 2: Highest valuations are 74 (Item 4), 65 (Item 5), 52 (Item 3)
- Agent 3: Highest valuations are 96 (Item 0), 85 (Item 6), 37 (Item 3)

Now, let's try to allocate items to maximize each agent's value while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent and that all items are allocated.

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 99) as it's their highest valued item.
2. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 74) as it's their highest valued item.
3. Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3 (value 85) as it's their second highest valued item.
4. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (value 71) as it's their second highest valued item.
5. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 95) to maximize their value.
6. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 63) as it's their third highest valued item.
7. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 (value 52) to balance the allocation.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while maximizing the total value for each agent.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [6]
}
```
