Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  52  34  16  78   4  36
1   9  21  31   2  11  12  85
2  49  42  32  49  96  29  63
3  12   0  26   0  56  42   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Valuations: [0, 52, 34, 16, 78, 4, 36]
   - Highest valuations are for item 4 (78) and item 1 (52).

2. Agent 1:
   - Valuations: [9, 21, 31, 2, 11, 12, 85]
   - Highest valuation is for item 6 (85).

3. Agent 2:
   - Valuations: [49, 42, 32, 49, 96, 29, 63]
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (96), but it conflicts with agent 0's choice, so the next highest is item 3 (49).

4. Agent 3:
   - Valuations: [12, 0, 26, 0, 56, 42, 3]
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (56), but it conflicts with agent 0's choice, so the next highest is item 5 (42).

After considering these preferences and potential conflicts, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3
- Agent 3: Items 2, 5

This allocation gives each agent items that they have relatively high valuations for, while ensuring that all items are allocated and no item is given to more than one agent.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
