Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  84  55  56  16  81  96
1  21  24  40  72  76  84  71
2  78  47  78  17   5  83  45
3  21  79  96  26   6  68  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 6 (96), 1 (84), 5 (81), 0 (80)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 5 (84), 4 (76), 3 (72), 2 (40)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 0 (78), 2 (78), 5 (83), 1 (47)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (96), 6 (86), 1 (79), 5 (68)

Given these preferences and the goal to allocate all items while maximizing satisfaction, a possible allocation can be:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items that maximize their value without heavily impacting others' opportunity for high-value items.
- **Agent 1**: Focus on items that are not highly valued by other agents.
- **Agent 2**: Choose items that are not critical for others.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items that provide high value but are less contested.

After analyzing the table and attempting to balance the allocation based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction, we can make the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that offer them significant value while keeping the total number of items allocated to 7.
