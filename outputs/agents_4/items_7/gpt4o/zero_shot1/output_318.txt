Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  46  56  43  34  83  23
1  47   8  87  23  92  95  62
2  27  28  50  39  67  14  97
3  96  25  69  96  12   6  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of the items. We can approach this by ensuring each agent receives at least one item they highly value, if possible, while distributing the items as evenly as possible among the agents.

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are [53, 46, 56, 43, 34, 83, 23]. The highest value is 83 for item 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are [47, 8, 87, 23, 92, 95, 62]. The highest value is 95 for item 5, but it's already allocated. Next highest is 92 for item 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are [27, 28, 50, 39, 67, 14, 97]. The highest value is 97 for item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are [96, 25, 69, 96, 12, 6, 69]. The highest value is 96 for items 0 and 3.

Let's allocate based on these preferences while ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 5 (value 83).
- **Agent 1**: Allocated item 4 (value 92).
- **Agent 2**: Allocated item 6 (value 97).
- **Agent 3**: Allocated item 0 (value 96).

Now, four items (5, 4, 6, 0) are allocated. We still have items 1, 2, and 3 left. Let's allocate these remaining items to ensure each agent receives at least one item and balance the distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Also allocate item 2 (value 56).
- **Agent 1**: Also allocate item 3 (value 23).
- **Agent 2**: Also allocate item 1 (value 28).

This allocation ensures each agent gets some items, and the distribution is balanced.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [0]
}
```
