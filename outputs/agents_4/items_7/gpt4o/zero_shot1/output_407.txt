Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  92  57  11  18  87  18
1  49  29  12   1  82   4   9
2  22  95  32  64  43  44  60
3  36  27  61  25  39  90  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items so that each agent is reasonably satisfied based on their preferences. One approach is to look for allocations that maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 highly (68), item 1 very highly (92), and item 5 highly (87).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 due to its highest value.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (82).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 1 highly (95), but it is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is item 6 (60).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 5 highly (90).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

At this point, items 0, 2, and 3 remain to be allocated. We need to assign these to agents without exceeding 7 items in total.

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (as it is their next highest preference).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (as it is their next highest preference).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (as it is their next highest preference).

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair amount based on their preferences.
