Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  68  75  69  56   0  10
1   1  58  92  82  32  93  58
2  99   8  42  53  29  22  46
3  39  76  18   0  18  58  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent based on their valuations. We should also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 0, 2, and 3. However, Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 0 (value 88).
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 the most (value 93), followed by item 2 (value 92).
3. **Agent 2**: This agent's highest valuation is for item 0 (value 99). Since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0, we consider the next highest value, which is item 6 (value 46).
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 1 the most (value 76), followed by item 6 (value 82).

Considering these preferences and ensuring each agent gets a fair allocation, here is one possible allocation:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a share of the total items, and each item is allocated based on maximizing agent satisfaction:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
