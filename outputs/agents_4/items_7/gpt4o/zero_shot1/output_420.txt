Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  28  99  48  54  19  10
1  15  77  16  56  43  86  93
2  96  39  56  49  53  45   5
3   4  32  15  75  98  56  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers both the preferences and the total number of items each agent should receive. Given there are 7 items and 4 agents, ideally, each agent should receive approximately 1 or 2 items. We'll aim to maximize the total satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest value each agent places on them while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (99), Item 0 (63)
   - Assign item 2.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (93), Item 5 (86)
   - Assign item 6.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 2 (56)
   - Item 0 is available, assign it.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 3 (75)
   - Assign item 4.

Now, allocate the remaining items (1, 3, and 5):

- **Item 1**:
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation (77). Assign item 1 to agent 1.

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 3 has a high valuation (75). Assign item 3 to agent 3.

- **Item 5**:
  - Agent 1 has a high valuation (86). Assign item 5 to agent 1.

Now, each agent has been allocated items, and all items are assigned:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
