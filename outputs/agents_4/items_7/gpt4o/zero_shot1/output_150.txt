Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  61  74  14  69  45  82
1  11  67  90  64  57  37  82
2  65  74  82  72  76  84  41
3  21   3  23   2   8   1  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we'll aim to fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents by maximizing the total value each agent receives. We'll do this by considering the valuation matrix and trying to assign items where they are valued the most by each agent.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Start by identifying which items are highly valued by each agent.

2. **Allocate Items**: Assign items to agents based on highest individual valuations, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

3. **Ensure Full Allocation**: As there are 7 items and 4 agents, some agents may receive more items than others. We should ensure all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- **Agent 0** shows high valuations for items 2 (74) and 6 (82).
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 2 (90) and 6 (82).
- **Agent 2** values items 5 (84) and 2 (82) highly.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 6 (96).

To maximize fairness while also considering the individual high valuations, we can make the following allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (32) and item 1 (61).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 2 (90).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (84) and item 4 (76).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 6 (96) and item 3 (2).

This way, we ensure each agent receives items they value and all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their respective valuations, with a total of 7 items distributed among the 4 agents.
