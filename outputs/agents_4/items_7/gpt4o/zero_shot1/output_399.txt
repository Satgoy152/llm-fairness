Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  54  87  66  33  97  92
1  29  44  23  71   3   4  58
2  19  99  89  51  85  67  45
3   9  57  62  74  63   7  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 57 62 74 63  7 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent according to their valuations. We'll evaluate each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items so that each agent receives items that they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's assess the agents' highest individual item valuations:

- Agent 0: Highest valuations are item 5 (97) and item 6 (92).
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is item 3 (71).
- Agent 2: Highest valuations are item 1 (99) and item 2 (89).
- Agent 3: Highest valuation is item 3 (74).

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Allocate item 5 (value 97) and item 6 (value 92).
2. **Agent 1:** Allocate item 3 (value 71).
3. **Agent 2:** Allocate item 1 (value 99) and item 2 (value 89).
4. **Agent 3:** Allocate item 4 (value 63) and item 0 (value 9).

Now, let's verify the allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2
- Agent 3: Items 4, 0

This utilizes all 7 items and each agent receives at least one item, ensuring a fair distribution based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4, 0]
}
```
