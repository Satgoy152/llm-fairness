Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  94  35  10  16  12  24
1  73  89  84  35  28  77  11
2  86  94  59  56  55  22  48
3  39  86  28  38  66  25  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 5 94 35 10 16 12 24]
 [73 89 84 35 28 77 11]
 [86 94 59 56 55 22 48]
 [39 86 28 38 66 25 23]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic to maximize the overall valuation. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This may not guarantee perfect fairness, but it will ensure that each item is appreciated the most by the agent receiving it.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is 86 by agent 2.
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is 94 by both agent 0 and agent 2. We can allocate it to agent 0 to balance the items initially.
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is 84 by agent 1.
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is 56 by agent 2.
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is 66 by agent 3.
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is 77 by agent 1.
7. Item 6: The highest valuation is 48 by agent 2.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 3, 6],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while also distributing the items among the agents.
