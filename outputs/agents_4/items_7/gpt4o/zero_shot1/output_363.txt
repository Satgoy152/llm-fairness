Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  95  80  42  59   9   6
1  15  20  51  69   1  29  92
2  29  82  16  69  44  39  28
3  77  88  69  55  12   6  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. A common approach is to use a method like the "maximal total valuation" or "envy-free" allocation if possible. Here, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring a fair distribution.

Let's proceed with an allocation that seeks to balance these considerations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most at 95.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the most at 92.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the second most after Agent 0 at 82. However, they also value item 3 significantly at 69.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most at 88, but since item 1 is already allocated, we consider their next highest value, which is item 0 at 77.

Given these preferences, here is a potential allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (second-highest after item 1, which is already taken).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest remaining valuation).

Now, for the unallocated items:

- Items 2, 4, and 5 remain unallocated:
  - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest preference after item 1).
  - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest preference after item 6).
  - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (next highest preference after item 3).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items they have relatively high valuations for, and all items are distributed among the agents.
