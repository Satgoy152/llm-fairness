Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  69  37  34  95  96  45
1  84  86  98  44  39  50   5
2  31  88  14  17  28  93  68
3  59  56  90  78  35  46  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on the valuations, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest valuations:**
   - Agent 0: The highest valuations are for items 4 (95) and 5 (96).
   - Agent 1: The highest valuation is for item 2 (98).
   - Agent 2: The highest valuation is for item 5 (93) and item 1 (88).
   - Agent 3: The highest valuation is for item 2 (90).

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 since it has the highest valuation for Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 since it has the highest valuation for Agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 since it's the second highest for Agent 2 and item 5 is already allocated.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3 since it's the next best available for Agent 3.

3. **Assign remaining items to balance allocation:**
   - Agent 0 has one item (5), Agent 1 has one (2), Agent 2 has one (1), Agent 3 has one (0).
   - The remaining items 3, 4, and 6 need to be allocated.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (second-highest remaining valuation for Agent 2).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (next available for Agent 3).

With this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
