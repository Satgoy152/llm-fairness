Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  53  49   0  44  94  41
1  71  20  74  97   0  20  28
2  83  87   2   5  94  82  23
3  33  18  98  51  50  12  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 53 49  0 44 94 41]
 [71 20 74 97  0 20 28]
 [83 87  2  5 94 82 23]
 [33 18 98 51 50 12 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will also ensure that all items are allocated and no agent is left without consideration.

Let's consider the following approach:

1. Calculate the maximum valuation each agent has for any item.
2. Allocate the item with the highest value to the corresponding agent.
3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Agent 3 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 98.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 97.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most with a valuation of 94.
4. Agent 0 values item 5 the most with a valuation of 94.
5. Agent 2 values item 1 the second most with a valuation of 87.
6. Agent 2 values item 0 the third most with a valuation of 83.
7. Agent 1 values item 6 the second most with a valuation of 28.

After these allocations, all items have been assigned. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 4, 0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations.
