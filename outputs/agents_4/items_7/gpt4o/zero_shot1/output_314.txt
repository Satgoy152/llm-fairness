Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  19  73  54  43  69  56
1  99  74   1  25  34  11  93
2  76  37  38  85  43  65  75
3  93  25  83  38  46  85  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 19 73 54 43 69 56]
 [99 74  1 25 34 11 93]
 [76 37 38 85 43 65 75]
 [93 25 83 38 46 85 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6.

Let's consider an allocation that tries to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 99), as Agent 1 values it the most.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 19), as Agent 0 values it the most among what remains.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 73), as Agent 0 values it the most.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 85), as Agent 2 values it the most.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 46), as Agent 3 values it decently and needs an item.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 65), as Agent 2 values it the most among what remains.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value 95), as Agent 3 values it the most.

Based on this allocation, the final distribution is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents.
