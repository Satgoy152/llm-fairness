Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  68  68  21  29  97  24
1  56  92  20   9  42  97  78
2  20   1  44  80  61  74  76
3  97  88  49  83   2  81  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring every item is allocated. Let's analyze the given valuations and attempt to distribute the items optimally:

- First, look at the highest value each agent has for any item, as it might give a good starting point for allocation.
- Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no agent receives more items than necessary.

Here's a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it at 97, which is the highest.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 92, which is the highest.
- **Item 2**: Both Agents 0 and 1 value it at 68, but Agent 0 has fewer high-value items, so assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it at 83, which is the highest.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it at 61, which is higher than the other agents.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it at 97. Assign it to Agent 1, who has fewer items at this stage.
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it at 76, which is the highest.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most and distributes the items in a balanced way.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

Each agent has been assigned items based on their highest valuations, and all items have been allocated without any conflicts.
