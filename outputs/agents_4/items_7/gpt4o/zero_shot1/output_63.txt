Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  35  36  64  70  61  95
1   8  59  28   9  16  50   2
2  12  44  39  73  66  92  54
3  90  94  44   4  20   3  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that all 7 items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item.

Let's evaluate the allocation step-by-step to ensure fairness:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 the highest at 95. We will assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest at 59. We will assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the highest at 92. We will assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest at 94. We will assign item 3 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated items 1, 3, 5, and 6. We need to allocate items 0, 2, and 4.

5. **For item 0:** 
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 90. We will assign item 0 to agent 3.

6. **For item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 36, agent 1 at 28, agent 2 at 39, and agent 3 at 44. We will assign item 2 to agent 3 (the highest value).

7. **For item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 70. We will assign item 4 to agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and the highest possible value is received by each agent. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
