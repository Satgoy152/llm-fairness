Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  96  60  49  36  15  83
1  57  47  38  25   0  48  25
2  98  54   9   4  97  24  85
3  56  79  59  82  16  82  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total value while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 6. 
2. **Agent 1**: Has a moderate valuation for item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 3 and 5.

Allocating based on the highest preferences while ensuring every item is distributed, we can propose the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 6]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]
- Agent 3: [3, 5]

This distribution ensures that each item is allocated, and each agent receives at least one item. We can now present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
