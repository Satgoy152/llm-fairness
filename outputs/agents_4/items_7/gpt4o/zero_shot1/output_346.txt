Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  86  44   9  38  10  44
1  49  57  33  66  76  39  95
2  52  21  75  31  89  53  16
3  98   5  36   1  99  32  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. Here, we have four agents and seven items. To achieve a reasonable distribution, we can look for an allocation where each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and the total value is balanced across agents.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for items 0, 1, and 2. Let's assign item 0 (value 91) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 6. Let's assign item 6 (value 95) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4. Let's assign item 4 (value 89) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** has a very high valuation for item 3. Let's assign item 3 (value 1) to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and 3 items remain to be allocated. Let's ensure each agent has at least one item and try to maximize the remaining values:

5. **Agent 0** can take another item, so we assign item 1 (value 86) to Agent 0.

6. From the remaining items (2 and 5), let's consider the highest value allocation:
   - Agent 2 can take item 2 (value 75).
   - Agent 3 can take item 5 (value 32).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the values are reasonably distributed.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
