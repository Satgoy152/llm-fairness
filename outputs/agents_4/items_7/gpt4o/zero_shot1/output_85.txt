Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74   6  75  75  15  46  41
1  11  53  50  25  97  94  63
2  85  44   0  42  60  24  20
3  30  76  16  69  67  25  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to allocate all 7 items among the 4 agents, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: prefers items 2, 3, and 0 (highest values).
- Agent 1: prefers items 4, 5, and 6.
- Agent 2: prefers item 0 the most.
- Agent 3: prefers items 1 and 6.

Considering these preferences, we can attempt to allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 because of the high value.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest value.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their highest value.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 3, as it is one of their highest values.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it highly and we need to balance allocations.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is their second-highest value.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 3, as this balances the allocations and is valued by them.

Now, let's confirm the allocations ensure each agent is getting at least one item and that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [4, 5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [1, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all items are distributed. The allocations seem to respect the agents' preferences as closely as possible while keeping the allocation fair.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
