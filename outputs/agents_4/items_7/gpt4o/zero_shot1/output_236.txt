Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  92  99  12  61  14  68
1  53  50  38  46  98  79  28
2  67  45  48  39  30  21   7
3  67  21   0  98  59   2  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List each agent's highest-valued items:** Start by identifying the highest-valued items for each agent. This helps in making decisions about allocations that maximize each agent's satisfaction.

2. **Assign items based on highest value and availability:** Allocate items one by one based on the highest value for each agent while ensuring that no item is double-allocated.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated:** After making allocations based on high values, we will ensure that all items are assigned to agents.

Let's work through the table:

- **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (99), followed by item 1 (92), then item 6 (68).
- **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (98), followed by item 5 (79), then item 0 (53).
- **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (67), followed by item 2 (48), then item 1 (45).
- **Agent 3** values item 3 the most (98), followed by item 6 (96), then item 0 (67).

Following these preferences and ensuring a fair distribution with all items allocated, we come up with the following allocation:

1. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0** (highest value for Agent 0).
2. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1** (highest value for Agent 1).
3. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 3** (highest value for Agent 3).
4. **Allocate item 6 to Agent 3** (second-highest value for Agent 3).
5. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 2** (highest value for Agent 2).
6. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0** (second-highest value for Agent 0).
7. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 1** (second-highest value for Agent 1).

This ensures each agent has a fair share, and all items are distributed. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation respects the preferences as much as possible while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
