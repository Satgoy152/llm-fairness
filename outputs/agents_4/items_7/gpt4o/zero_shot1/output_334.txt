Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  35  13  36  87  69  29
1  31  50  91  59  46  81  98
2  79  67  18  86  77  89  18
3  76  30  35  93  95  11  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible and all items are distributed. We must ensure that exactly 7 items are allocated in total.

Let's approach this by attempting to maximize the value each agent receives based on their valuations.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (87).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 6 (98).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 5 (89).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 4 (95).

We can start by allocating items based on the highest value each agent has for a unique item. If conflicts arise, we will try to balance the overall allocation.

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1: 98 (Agent 1's highest)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2: 89 (Agent 2's highest)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3: 95 (Agent 3's highest)
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2: 79 (Agent 2's second-highest)
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3: 93 (Agent 3's second-highest)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1: 50 (Agent 1's second-highest)
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0: 13 (Agent 0's highest remaining after conflicts)

With this allocation, each agent receives items that maximize their value, and all items are distributed. 

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
