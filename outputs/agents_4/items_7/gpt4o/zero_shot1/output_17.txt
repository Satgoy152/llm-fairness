Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  61  42  72  33  49  25
1  97  35  99  14  35  42  54
2   8   7  62  90  95  95  17
3  64  79  15  38  79  26  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 61 42 72 33 49 25]
 [97 35 99 14 35 42 54]
 [ 8  7 62 90 95 95 17]
 [64 79 15 38 79 26 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their individual valuations, we need to consider the preferences of each agent and try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a share that reflects their preferences as much as possible. Let's analyze the given valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  61  42  72  33  49  25
1  97  35  99  14  35  42  54
2   8   7  62  90  95  95  17
3  64  79  15  38  79  26  64
```

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1 Priority**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (99), so we allocate item 2 to agent 1.

2. **Agent 2 Priority**: Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 and 5 (95 each). We can allocate item 4 to agent 2.

3. **Agent 3 Priority**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 (79), so we allocate item 1 to agent 3.

4. **Agent 0 Priority**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (72), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.

5. **Remaining Items**: Items 0, 5, and 6 remain unallocated. 

6. **Re-evaluate Remaining Items**:
    - Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0 (97), so we allocate item 0 to agent 1.
    - Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5 (95), so we allocate item 5 to agent 2.
    - Agent 3 and item 6: Agent 3 has a valuation of 64 for item 6 which is relatively high compared to others' valuations, so we allocate item 6 to agent 3.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

Each agent has been considered for their highest priority items, and all items have been allocated.
