Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  53  77  81  71  17  36
1  43  48  75  33  58  32  14
2  33   0  64  98  51  80  53
3  73  50  89  48  54  52  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable allocation of items. There are several strategies to approach this, such as maximizing each agent's total value, ensuring no agent receives an empty allocation, or distributing items based on specific needs or valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the highest (81). Allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the highest (75). Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the highest, but since it's already taken, consider item 5 (80). Allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the highest, but it's already taken. Consider item 0 (73). Allocate item 0 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items among the agents while considering their next highest preferences:

5. Allocate item 1 to agent 0 (53).
6. Allocate item 4 to agent 3 (54).
7. Allocate item 6 to agent 2 (53).

This results in a fair distribution where each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation maximizes their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a share of the items, and the total number of items allocated is 7.
