Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37   2  67  53  78   9  78
1  24  16  17  28  50  48  46
2  94  93  54  86  44  16  40
3   6  39  52   5  82  28  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents fairly, we can use the "max-min fairness" principle, which tries to maximize the minimum satisfaction among the agents. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their minimum satisfaction.

Given the valuations of the items by each agent, we can start by allocating items to agents in a way that increases their minimum satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 highly (78), so we assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 highly (48), so we assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 highly (94), so we assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 highly (59), so we assign item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (1, 2, 3).

5. **Agent 2**: Also values item 1 highly (93), assign item 1 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 3**: Also values item 2 highly (52), assign item 2 to Agent 3.
7. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 relatively higher (28), assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Now each agent has been allocated items such that their overall satisfaction is maximized based on their highest valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value the most, given the constraint of distributing all 7 items.
