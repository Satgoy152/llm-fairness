Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  18  24  23  56  30  75
1   7  48  27  13  76  38  98
2  74  51  74  72  90   7  38
3  13  11  75  23  53  94  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given the valuations provided, let's attempt to allocate the items to maximize fairness and satisfaction for each agent.

We can start by identifying which agent values each item the most and ensure that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the most (75) compared to other agents, so we assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (76) compared to other agents, so we assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most (74) compared to other agents, so we assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most (94) compared to other agents, so we assign item 5 to agent 3.

Now, each agent has one item. We have 3 items left to allocate (0, 1, and 3).

5. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (74), so we assign item 0 to agent 2.
6. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (48), so we assign item 1 to agent 1.
7. Agent 3 values item 3 the most (23), so we assign item 3 to agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```
