Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  65  58  17  92  46  40
1   1  19  24  19  17  42  53
2  63  61  70  15  18   9  26
3  23  69  79  95  51  55  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve that:

1. **Identify the highest values for each item**: 
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 90.
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it at 69.
   - Item 2: Agent 3 values it at 79.
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values it at 95.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 92.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 42.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 53.

2. **Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most**:
   - Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Item 2 to Agent 3.
   - Item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible**:
   - Agents 0, 1, and 3 receive items, but Agent 2 does not in this allocation.

4. **Present the allocations in the specified JSON format**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed based on the highest valuations, maximizing the total satisfaction for each agent.
