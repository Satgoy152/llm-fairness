Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  46  52   5  69  98  90
1  86  65  66  71  36  27  62
2  64  63  71  60  10  32  32
3  81  13  50   6  40  76  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 13 50  6 40 76 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items they are assigned. One way to approach this is by using a greedy method where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 86. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
   
2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 46. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
   
3. Item 2:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 71. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
   
4. Item 3:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 71. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
   
5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 69. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
   
6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 98. Assign item 5 to agent 0.
   
7. Item 6:
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 97. Assign item 6 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated all 7 items. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6]
}
```
