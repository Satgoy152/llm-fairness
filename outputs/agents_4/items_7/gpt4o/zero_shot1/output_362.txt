Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  88  17  51  25  25  85
1  29  24  50  74  86  88  35
2  63  69  34  96  34  54  24
3  75  75  46  95  41  30  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 24 50 74 86 88 35]
 [63 69 34 96 34 54 24]
 [75 75 46 95 41 30 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of their valued items. Given that there are 4 agents and 7 items, one possible approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while also ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 2: Agent 2 values item 3 at 96, which is the highest valuation for any item by any agent.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0: Agent 0 values item 1 at 88, which is the highest value remaining after item 3.
3. Assign item 5 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 5 at 88, which is the highest remaining for agent 1.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 3: Agent 3 values item 0 at 75, which is the highest remaining value for agent 3.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 4 at 86, which is a high remaining value.
6. Assign item 6 to agent 0: Agent 0 values item 6 at 85, which is a high remaining value for agent 0.
7. Assign item 2 to agent 2: Agent 2 values item 2 at 34, which is their next best option.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
