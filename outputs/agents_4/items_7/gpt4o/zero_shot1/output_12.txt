Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  91  47  70  59  70  16
1  32  46  44   9  79  83  56
2  60  93  81   9  32  73  39
3  85  15  83  32  67  98  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets approximately the same total value from the items they receive. One common approach to achieve this is to use a method that maximizes fairness, such as the max-min fairness approach, where we aim to maximize the minimum value any agent receives. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate the total value for each agent if they were to receive each item individually:**

- Agent 0: 52 + 91 + 47 + 70 + 59 + 70 + 16 = 405
- Agent 1: 32 + 46 + 44 + 9 + 79 + 83 + 56 = 349
- Agent 2: 60 + 93 + 81 + 9 + 32 + 73 + 39 = 387
- Agent 3: 85 + 15 + 83 + 32 + 67 + 98 + 21 = 401

2. **Allocate items one by one based on the highest value for each agent:**

Starting with the items that have the highest valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most: 91
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most: 83
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most: 93
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most: 98

To avoid conflicts, assign items by checking the next highest value if there is a conflict:

- Assign item 1 to agent 2 (Agent 2 values it highest and agent 0 also values it highly, but agent 2's total valuation is higher)
- Assign item 5 to agent 3 (Agent 3 values it highest)
- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (next highest valued item for agent 0 not yet taken)
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (next highest valued item for agent 1 not yet taken)

3. **Continue allocating remaining items based on minimizing envy and maximizing value:**

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2 to agent 3 (next highest valued item for agent 3)
- Item 3 to agent 0 (next highest valued item for agent 0)
- Item 6 to agent 1 (next highest valued item for agent 1)

4. **Final Allocation:**

After considering the above steps, here is a proposed fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total values each agent receives, while ensuring each gets at least one item where possible.
