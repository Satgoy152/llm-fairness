Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  78  48  34  94  29  91
1  12   1  28  13  33  10   0
2  57   6  51  78  73  92  28
3   5  45  58  54  85  48  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. In this scenario, we will aim to distribute the items based on the highest value each agent assigns to the items, considering each agent should receive at least one item if possible.

Let's consider the highest valuations each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (94).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (28).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (92).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4 (85).

Given that agent 0 and agent 3 both have high valuations for item 4, we need to prioritize one and allocate another high-value item to the other. We can resolve conflicts by assigning the next highest item to one of the agents.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4 and 6 (valuations: 94 and 91)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (valuation: 28)
- Agent 2: Items 5 and 3 (valuations: 92 and 78)
- Agent 3: Items 0 and 1 (valuations: 5 and 45)

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations.
