Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  35  66  69  55  57  64
1  81  56  86  63  32  76   1
2  42  26  87  51  85  89  80
3  25  36  63  42  38  11  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the allocation tries to maximize the total value received by each agent. We will go through the table and allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each item by any agent, taking care not to allocate more than 7 items in total.

Let's start by examining the valuations for each item:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0: 3
  - Agent 1: 81
  - Agent 2: 42
  - Agent 3: 25
  - Highest valuation: Agent 1

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0: 35
  - Agent 1: 56
  - Agent 2: 26
  - Agent 3: 36
  - Highest valuation: Agent 1

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0: 66
  - Agent 1: 86
  - Agent 2: 87
  - Agent 3: 63
  - Highest valuation: Agent 2

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0: 69
  - Agent 1: 63
  - Agent 2: 51
  - Agent 3: 42
  - Highest valuation: Agent 0

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0: 55
  - Agent 1: 32
  - Agent 2: 85
  - Agent 3: 38
  - Highest valuation: Agent 2

- **Item 5**: 
  - Agent 0: 57
  - Agent 1: 76
  - Agent 2: 89
  - Agent 3: 11
  - Highest valuation: Agent 2

- **Item 6**: 
  - Agent 0: 64
  - Agent 1: 1
  - Agent 2: 80
  - Agent 3: 55
  - Highest valuation: Agent 2

Based on the highest valuation, the initial allocation of items is:

- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [2, 4, 5, 6]
- Agent 0: [3]

This allocation gives Agent 1 two items, Agent 2 four items, Agent 0 one item, and Agent 3 no items. The total number of allocated items is 7, which is correct.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 4, 5, 6],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most, while also distributing exactly 7 items among the agents.
