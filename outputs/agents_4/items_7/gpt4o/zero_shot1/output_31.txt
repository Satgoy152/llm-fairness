Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  59  85  54  37   8  23
1  33  55  63  32  29  88  67
2  71  77  99  95  59  40  16
3  63  38  37  81  90   5  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to assign the items based on each agent's highest valuation for the unassigned items at each step. 

Let's go through this process:

1. Look at the highest value each agent has for the available items and allocate the item to the agent that values it the most.

2. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it at 99, which is the highest valuation among all agents for all items. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
   
2. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it at 95, which is the highest remaining value. Assign item 3 to agent 2.

3. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it at 90. Assign item 4 to agent 3.

4. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 88. Assign item 5 to agent 1.

5. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it at 71, which is the highest among unallocated items. Assign item 0 to agent 2.

6. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 77, which is the highest among unallocated items. Assign item 1 to agent 2.

7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 67, which is the highest among unallocated items. Assign item 6 to agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
