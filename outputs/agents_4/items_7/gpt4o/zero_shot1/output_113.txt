Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  63  23  12  53  63  27
1  27  79   0  50  41  82  72
2  52   9  16  13  41  33  53
3  72   1  37   1  49   6  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 63 23 12 53 63 27]
 [27 79  0 50 41 82 72]
 [52  9 16 13 41 33 53]
 [72  1 37  1 49  6 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent. We will go through the matrix and assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. This method ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Here's the allocation process:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 52
   - Agent 1 values it at 27
   - Agent 2 values it at 52
   - Agent 3 values it at 72 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 3

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 63
   - Agent 1 values it at 79 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 9
   - Agent 3 values it at 1
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 23
   - Agent 1 values it at 0
   - Agent 2 values it at 16
   - Agent 3 values it at 37 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 3

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 12
   - Agent 1 values it at 50 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 13
   - Agent 3 values it at 1
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 53 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 41
   - Agent 2 values it at 41
   - Agent 3 values it at 49
   - Allocate to Agent 0

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 63
   - Agent 1 values it at 82 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 33
   - Agent 3 values it at 6
   - Allocate to Agent 1

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 values it at 27
   - Agent 1 values it at 72 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 53
   - Agent 3 values it at 49
   - Allocate to Agent 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
