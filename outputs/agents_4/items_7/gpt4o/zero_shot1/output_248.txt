Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  54  31  36  90  97  57
1  98  59  25  59  74  79  19
2  77   5   4  96  40  77  66
3  73  31  72  33   5  92  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow a strategy where we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuation of the items. Here is one approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** 
   - Calculate the maximum value each agent places on each item.
   
2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Start by assigning items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.
   
3. **Ensure Fair Distribution:**
   - Balance the number of items each agent receives.

By following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 5 very highly (97), so assign item 5.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 0 (98) the highest among all agents, so assign item 0.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 3 (96) very highly, so assign item 3.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 2 (72) the most, so assign item 2.
- **Remaining Items (1, 4, 6):**
  - Agent 0 values item 4 (90) the most, so assign item 4.
  - Agent 1 values item 1 (59) highly, so assign item 1.
  - Agent 2 values item 6 (66) quite highly, so assign item 6.

Following this allocation strategy:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most while maintaining a balanced distribution of items.
