Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  35  27  32  93  14  96
1  27  27  99  65  27  92  57
2  13  60  11  35  47  73   1
3  52  19  66  43  59  44  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27 27 99 65 27 92 57]
 [13 60 11 35 47 73  1]
 [52 19 66 43 59 44 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Given there are 4 agents and 7 items, we can allocate 1 or 2 items to each agent, with at least one agent receiving 1 item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [45, 35, 27, 32, 93, 14, 96]
- Agent 1: [27, 27, 99, 65, 27, 92, 57]
- Agent 2: [13, 60, 11, 35, 47, 73, 1]
- Agent 3: [52, 19, 66, 43, 59, 44, 11]

Let's assign items to each agent in a way that maximizes their total valuation:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for items 4 (93) and 6 (96).
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 2 (99) and item 5 (92).
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 5 (73) and item 1 (60).
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 0 (52) and item 2 (66).

Let's allocate the items, ensuring no conflicts and maximizing value:

- Agent 0: [4, 6] (93, 96)
- Agent 1: [2] (99)
- Agent 2: [5, 1] (73, 60)
- Agent 3: [0, 3] (52, 43)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with high-value items going to the agents who value them most.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
