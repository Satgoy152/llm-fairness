Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  60  31  76  27  23  75
1  64  41  40  21  70   6  59
2  74  54   7  48  67  28  77
3  43  51   9  43  31  36  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We aim to distribute the items so that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their own valuation.

Let's look at a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the maximum value for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Their highest value is for item 3 (76), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Their highest value is for item 4 (70), so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Their highest value is for item 6 (77), so assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Their highest value is for item 1 (51), so assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated items 1, 3, 4, and 6. We have items 0, 2, and 5 remaining to be allocated.

- Consider the remaining items and allocate them to maximize the total value:
  - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (74), so assign item 0 to Agent 2.
  - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (31), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
  - Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most (36), so assign item 5 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
