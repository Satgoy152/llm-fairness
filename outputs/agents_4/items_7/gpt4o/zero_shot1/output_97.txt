Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  87  29  15  72  15  81
1   2  46  49  33  36   2  88
2  50  48  36  30  29  76  22
3  55  96  47  35  36  91   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach is to iteratively assign items to the agent who values them the most, updating the table until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Initial Matrix of Valuations:**

   ```
   Agent\Item     0   1   2   3   4   5   6
   0             40  87  29  15  72  15  81
   1              2  46  49  33  36   2  88
   2             50  48  36  30  29  76  22
   3             55  96  47  35  36  91   8
   ```

2. **Step-by-Step Allocation:**

   - **Item 1:** Max value is 96 by Agent 3.
   - **Item 6:** Max value is 88 by Agent 1.
   - **Item 5:** Max value is 91 by Agent 3 (Agent 3 already got item 1).
   - **Item 0:** Max value is 55 by Agent 3 (Agent 3 already got items 1 and 5).
   - **Item 4:** Max value is 72 by Agent 0.
   - **Item 2:** Max value is 49 by Agent 1 (Agent 1 already got item 6).
   - **Item 3:** Max value is 35 by Agent 3 (Agent 3 already got items 1, 5, and 0).

3. **Resulting Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Item 4
   - Agent 1: Items 6, 2
   - Agent 2: No items
   - Agent 3: Items 1, 5, 0, 3

4. **Final JSON Allocation:**
  
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 5, 0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 7 items allocated based on maximizing the value to the agents.
