Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  44  66  70  59  49  27
1  16  77  91  91  63  12  58
2  41  38  47  81   3  12  26
3  37  99  76  28  57  33  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Values: [51, 44, 66, 70, 59, 49, 27]

2. Agent 1: 
   - Values: [16, 77, 91, 91, 63, 12, 58]

3. Agent 2: 
   - Values: [41, 38, 47, 81, 3, 12, 26]

4. Agent 3: 
   - Values: [37, 99, 76, 28, 57, 33, 33]

Using a greedy approach, let's assign items based on the highest available value to an agent that hasn't received the maximum number of items yet.

Assignment step-by-step:

- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 3 (99).
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 1 (91).
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 1 (91).
- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0 (51).
- Item 4 is most valued by Agent 1 (63), but Agent 1 has 2 items already, so it goes to Agent 0 (59).
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 0 (49).
- Item 6 is most valued by Agent 1 (58), but Agent 1 has 2 items already, so it goes to Agent 0 (27).

Now each agent has received:
- Agent 0: 4 items
- Agent 1: 2 items
- Agent 2: 0 items
- Agent 3: 1 item

Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1]
}
```
