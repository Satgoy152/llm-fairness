Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  92  71  40  26  89  12
1  55  87  43  92  53  73   5
2  46  13  97  65  27   3  81
3  59  88  70   7  90  23  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We need to consider the valuations carefully and try to distribute items in such a way that no agent feels significantly undervalued.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 0 (95), Item 1 (92), Item 5 (89).
   - Allocation: Items 0, 1, and 5.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 3 (92), Item 1 (87), Item 5 (73).
   - Allocation: Item 3.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 2 (97), Item 6 (81).
   - Allocation: Items 2 and 6.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: Item 4 (90), Item 1 (88).
   - Allocation: Item 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4]
}
```
