Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  50  10   0  42  64   1
1  47  89  47  60  35   6  27
2  25   5  61  21   8  91  74
3  26   4  84  37  57  42  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible, potentially maximizing the minimum value that each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items.

2. Check for any potential improvements or reallocations that could increase fairness.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (47).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (89).
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most (84).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (60).
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (57).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (91).
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (74).

Now we have:
- Agent 0: No items, total value = 0
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 3], total value = 47 + 89 + 60 = 196
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6], total value = 91 + 74 = 165
- Agent 3: Items [2, 4], total value = 84 + 57 = 141

To ensure fairness, we should aim for each agent to get items. Let's attempt a reallocation:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 38 for Agent 0).
- Agent 1 has Items [1, 3] (total value = 89 + 60 = 149).
- Agent 2 keeps Items [5, 6] (total value = 165).
- Agent 3 keeps Items [2, 4] (total value = 141).

This results in:
- Agent 0: Items [0], total value = 38
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3], total value = 149
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6], total value = 165
- Agent 3: Items [2, 4], total value = 141

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
