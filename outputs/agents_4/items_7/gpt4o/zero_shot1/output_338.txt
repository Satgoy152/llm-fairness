Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  62  85  97  77  23  72
1  38  29  62  38  59  16  67
2  15  22  96  43  37  13  96
3   0  86   7  24   9  23   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to optimize the allocation so that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible solution:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

   - Agent 0: 46 + 62 + 85 + 97 + 77 + 23 + 72 = 462
   - Agent 1: 38 + 29 + 62 + 38 + 59 + 16 + 67 = 309
   - Agent 2: 15 + 22 + 96 + 43 + 37 + 13 + 96 = 322
   - Agent 3: 0 + 86 + 7 + 24 + 9 + 23 + 3 = 152

2. Allocate items to agents based on their valuations, trying to maximize their individual satisfaction:

   - Agent 0 receives items: 3, 2 (valuations: 97, 85)
   - Agent 1 receives items: 0, 4 (valuations: 38, 59)
   - Agent 2 receives items: 6, 1 (valuations: 96, 22)
   - Agent 3 receives items: 5 (valuations: 23)

This allocation fairly distributes the items based on each agent's preferences and ensures all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [5]
}
```
