Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67   9  31  74  52  31  79
1  89  76  87  70  71  93  70
2  27  48  51  25  28  53  90
3  41  90  25  79  93  24  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67  9 31 74 52 31 79]
 [89 76 87 70 71 93 70]
 [27 48 51 25 28 53 90]
 [41 90 25 79 93 24 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation or to ensure that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly.

Let's begin by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0's highest values are for items 3 (74) and 6 (79).
- Agent 1's highest values are for items 5 (93), 2 (87), and 0 (89).
- Agent 2's highest values are for items 6 (90) and 5 (53).
- Agent 3's highest values are for items 4 (93) and 1 (90).

To fairly allocate the items, I will attempt to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that no agent receives more items than others, unless unavoidable due to the total number of items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for this item).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for this item).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for this item).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (second highest valuation for this item).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for this item).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation for this item).
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (third highest valuation for this item).

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5, 0, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets at least one item with Agent 1 receiving three items due to their high valuations and the need to allocate all 7 items.
