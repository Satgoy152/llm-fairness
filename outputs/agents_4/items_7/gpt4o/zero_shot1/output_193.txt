Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  50  81  80  41   1  56
1  99  56  82  40  41  29  15
2  59   5  96  71  96  74  58
3  30  62  23  18  19   1  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value received by each agent. This often involves finding an optimal match between agents and items using algorithms like the Hungarian method. However, given the constraints and the small number of items and agents, we can manually allocate items to ensure a fair distribution.

Let's try to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with a similar overall value.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [20, 50, 81, 80, 41, 1, 56]
   - Best item: Item 2 (value 81)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [99, 56, 82, 40, 41, 29, 15]
   - Best item: Item 0 (value 99)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [59, 5, 96, 71, 96, 74, 58]
   - Best item: Item 4 (value 96)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [30, 62, 23, 18, 19, 1, 58]
   - Best item: Item 1 (value 62)

Now let's allocate the remaining items by considering the next best options:

- **Agent 0:** Item 3 (value 80)
- **Agent 2:** Item 5 (value 74)
- **Agent 3:** Item 6 (value 58)

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3 (values 81, 80)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value 99)
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5 (values 96, 74)
- Agent 3: Items 1, 6 (values 62, 58)

This allocation maximizes the value for each agent based on their preferences.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
