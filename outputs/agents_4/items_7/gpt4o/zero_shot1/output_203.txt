Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  15  80  92   3  87   8
1  95  44  56  90  67   2   8
2  93  57  68  80  62  65  47
3  71  53  77  19  47  62  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 15 80 92  3 87  8]
 [95 44 56 90 67  2  8]
 [93 57 68 80 62 65 47]
 [71 53 77 19 47 62 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each.

Based on the given valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Best items for Agent 0: Item 3 (value 92)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Best items for Agent 1: Item 0 (value 95)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Best items for Agent 2: Item 2 (value 68)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Best items for Agent 3: Item 6 (value 91)

Now, one agent needs to receive one more item, and we should allocate the remaining items (1, 4, and 5) by considering their valuations:

- Item 1:
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (value 57)

- Item 4:
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 4 (value 67)

- Item 5:
  - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 5 (value 87)

Let's allocate the remaining items while keeping the balance in mind:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as it gives a relatively high valuation.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [6]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated in a way that maximizes the agents' valuations.
