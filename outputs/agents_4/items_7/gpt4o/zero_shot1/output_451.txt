Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  61  38  48  25  34  47
1  23   1  99  91  98  34  63
2  14  19  77  92  99  15  32
3   1   8  81  59  84  50   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 19 77 92 99 15 32]
 [ 1  8 81 59 84 50  0]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we should aim to distribute the items among the agents in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and no agent receives more than the others if it can be avoided. 

Initially, we can attempt to allocate the highest valued items to each agent, trying to ensure each agent gets a fair share. 

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 with a value of 67.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 with a value of 99.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 with a value of 99.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 with a value of 59.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have assigned 4 items, and 3 more items need to be allocated. Let's continue:

5. **Remaining items**: 1, 5, 6.

6. **Agent 1**: 
   - Second-highest valuation (after the already chosen item 2) is for item 4 (already taken); next highest is item 3 (already taken); then item 6 with a value of 63.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**: 
   - Next highest valuation (after the already chosen item 4) is for item 3 (already taken); then item 6 (already taken); then item 2 (already taken); next is item 5 with a value of 15.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest valuation (after the already chosen item 0) is for item 1 with a value of 61.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

All items have now been allocated. Let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

Each agent has received a fair allocation based on their highest valuations, considering the constraints of the problem.
