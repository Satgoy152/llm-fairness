Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  30  63  65   5  33  51
1  53   3  46  99  52  78  98
2  40  95  80  90  21  25  88
3  47  88  74  20  50  17   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives. We aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction is as high as possible, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. Given that there are 7 items and 4 agents, some agents might receive more items than others.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (76), Item 3 (65), Item 2 (63)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (99), Item 6 (98)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (95), Item 6 (88)
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (88), Item 2 (74)

A possible allocation based on maximizing individual agents' valuations while ensuring each item is allocated once could be:

- Agent 0: Item 0, Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2, Item 4, Item 6

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their preferences, with Agent 3 receiving more items due to specific valuation balances.
