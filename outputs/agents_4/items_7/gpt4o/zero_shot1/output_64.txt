Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  76  89  69  26  13   1
1  25  78  26  91  11  23  39
2  58  93  94  57  82  27  78
3  89  44  38  43   0  69  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes their satisfaction. We will aim to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 (89) and item 0 (81) highly.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 (91) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 2 (94) and 1 (93) very highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 (89) highly.

Given these preferences, we can aim to allocate items based on maximizing value for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (value 89)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 91)
- **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 93) and Item 6 (value 78)
- **Agent 3**: Item 0 (value 89) and Item 5 (value 69)

This allocation leaves items 4 and 5 to be distributed. Agent 3 values item 5 (69) highly, and Agent 2 values item 4 (82) highly. Thus, we'll finalize as follows:

- **Agent 0**: [2]
- **Agent 1**: [3]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 4, 6]
- **Agent 3**: [0, 5]

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4, 6],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
