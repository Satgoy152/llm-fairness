Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67   9  80  77  42  14  11
1  94  50  12  73  91   7  59
2   9  82  68  60  28  73  16
3  62  69   4  17  80  90  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations matrix, one approach is to assign the highest value items to agents who value them the most, checking to ensure each agent gets at least one item where possible, and no agent receives more than necessary at the cost of another.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most with 94.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most with 82.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most with 80.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with 77.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most with 91.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most with 90.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most with 86.

Each agent should ideally receive at least one item. Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Items [5, 6]

This allocation reflects a fair distribution based on the highest valuations and ensures each item is distributed to the agent that values it the most. Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
