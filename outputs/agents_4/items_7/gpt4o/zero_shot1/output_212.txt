Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  65  88  88  50  46  24
1  60  59   1  23  51  53  12
2  40  77  73  62   6  78  93
3  99  41  32  85  72  83  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and attempt to distribute them in a way that maximizes total value or ensures fairness. 

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 places the highest value of 99 on item 0 and reasonably high values on other items.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

2. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 places high values on items 2 and 3, with both valued at 88.
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 places relatively high values on items 4 and 5.
   - Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 1.

4. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 places high values on items 6 and 1.
   - Allocate items 6 and 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation gives each agent a fair number of items according to their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [0]
}
```
