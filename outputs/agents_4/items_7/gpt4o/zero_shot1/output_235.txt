Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  72  27  54  11  51   9
1  38  75   1  42  77  40  47
2  14   6  28   9  48  45  13
3  14  64  63  14  41  11  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can consider maximizing the total value for each agent based on their valuations. The challenge is to distribute all 7 items among the 4 agents.

One possible allocation strategy is to try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible and to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest value for each agent**: Start by giving each agent the item that they value the most, if possible, without overlapping.

2. **Allocate remaining items**: Once each agent has at least one item, allocate the remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 1 (value = 72).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 4 (value = 77).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 5 (value = 45).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 6 (value = 64).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- **Items left**: 0, 2, 3
  - Agent 1 also highly values item 1 and 3, but item 1 is already taken by Agent 0. 
  - Agent 0 has a reasonable value for item 3 (value = 54), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
  - Agent 3 has a good value for item 2 (value = 63), so allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
  - The last remaining item 0 can be given to Agent 1, who values it reasonably (value = 38).

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and attempts to maximize the value for each agent within the given constraints.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with each receiving at least one item.
