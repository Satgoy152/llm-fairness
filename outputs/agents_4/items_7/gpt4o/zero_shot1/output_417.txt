Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  17  49  90  79  65  41
1  87  69  22  65  16  60   4
2  86  85   0  48  60  25  34
3   5  21  55  42  42  21  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. We will consider the valuations and attempt to allocate the items to maximize the overall happiness of the agents.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy based on the highest values each agent has for specific items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 3: Value = 90 (highest for agent 0)
   - Item 0: Value = 89 (second highest for agent 0)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0: Value = 87 (second highest for agent 1, but already taken by agent 0)
   - Item 1: Value = 69 (highest for agent 1)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1: Value = 85 (second highest for agent 2, but already taken by agent 1)
   - Item 4: Value = 60 (highest for agent 2)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 2: Value = 55 (highest for agent 3)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take Item 5: Value = 65
- Agent 1 can take Item 2: Value = 22
- Agent 2 can take Item 6: Value = 34

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and the agents receive items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations.
