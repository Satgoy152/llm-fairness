Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  87  74  53  40  91  27
1  61  65  55  33  30   8  30
2  65  26  10  86  80  65  23
3  99  14  23  75  43  19  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 87 74 53 40 91 27]
 [61 65 55 33 30  8 30]
 [65 26 10 86 80 65 23]
 [99 14 23 75 43 19 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all 7 items are distributed. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate accordingly:

### Step 1: Identify High Valuations
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (91).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (61) and item 1 (65).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 (86) and 4 (80).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 (99).

### Step 2: Allocate Items
- Start by allocating items with the highest valuations:
  - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
  - Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (since 99 is the highest valuation).
  - Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
  - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

### Step 3: Allocate Remaining Items
- Remaining items are 1, 2, and 6.
- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1 (87).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 0 also has a high valuation for item 2 (74).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Item 6 remains:
  - Agent 0: 27
  - Agent 1: 30
  - Agent 2: 23
  - Agent 3: 33
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (highest valuation among remaining).

### Final Allocation
This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items, maximizing their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 1, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 gets items 0 and 6.
