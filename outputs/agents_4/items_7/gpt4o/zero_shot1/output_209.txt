Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  63  50  73  22  72  91
1   4  12  98  13  39  35  68
2  76  92  41  24  82  22  32
3  23  27  78  39  18  30  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that we have 4 agents and 7 items, one of the agents will receive only one item, and the others will receive two items each. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 6. We can allocate items 0 and 6 to this agent.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 highly, so we should allocate item 2 to them. They also have a decent valuation for item 6, but since item 6 is already assigned, we can allocate item 5, which has a good valuation.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 1 and 4. We can allocate these items to this agent.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5, but it is already taken. However, they also have a good valuation for item 3, so we allocate item 3 to them.

After this allocation, every agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with the total number of items allocated being 7.
