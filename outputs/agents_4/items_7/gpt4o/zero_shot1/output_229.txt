Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  50  38  84  90   6  44
1  30  94  97  42  81  92  77
2  40   8  96  56  84  23  47
3  57  82  90  32  66  67  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that considers their valuations. One approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual total valuation while attempting to balance the overall distribution.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Based on their valuations, Agent 0 highly values item 4 (value 90) and item 3 (value 84). Assigning these items to Agent 0 gives them a high total valuation.

2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 (value 94) and 2 (value 97). Assigning these items to Agent 1 aligns with their preferences.

3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2 highly values item 2 (value 96) but since it's already allocated, we look at other options. Item 4 (value 84) is also highly valued by Agent 2, but it's allocated to Agent 0, so we consider the next best options. Assign items 5 (value 23) and 6 (value 47) to Agent 2 as these are some of the remaining items with decent valuations.

4. **Agent 3:** Agent 3 values item 0 (value 57) and item 1 (value 82) highly. Since item 1 is already allocated to Agent 1, assign item 0 to Agent 3. Item 3 (value 32) is another option for Agent 3 given the remaining items.

Now, we need to finalize the allocations ensuring all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 3: Item [0]

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the agents while considering their preferences as much as possible.
