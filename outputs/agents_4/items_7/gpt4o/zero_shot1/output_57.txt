Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  77  95  24  71  71  32
1  70  45  51  88  90  76  81
2   9  13  58  75  14  87  68
3  77  72  58  79  15  34  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to distribute the items among the agents in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. One approach is to assign items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 1 (77) and 2 (95).
2. **Agent 1** values items 4 (90) and 3 (88) highly.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5 (87).
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 (77) highly.

We will allocate items based on the highest value each agent has until all items are fairly distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 2 (77, 95).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 3 and 4 (88, 90).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 (87).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 0 (77).

Items 6 is not yet allocated, and we choose to give it to the agent with the highest remaining valuation:

- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6 (81).

Now, all 7 items are allocated, and each agent has an integer number of items. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
