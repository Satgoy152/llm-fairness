Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  40  24  54  90   3  47
1  85  24  26  48  43   2  53
2   0  66  94  90  32  18  55
3  79  51  84  34  73  92  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll do this while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations given:

Agent 0: [7, 40, 24, 54, 90, 3, 47]
Agent 1: [85, 24, 26, 48, 43, 2, 53]
Agent 2: [0, 66, 94, 90, 32, 18, 55]
Agent 3: [79, 51, 84, 34, 73, 92, 26]

We will try to allocate items to the agents based on the highest value they place on available items, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the total items.

1. Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 4 (90).
2. Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 0 (85).
3. Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 2 (94).
4. Agent 3's highest valuation is for item 5 (92).

After these initial allocations, the items left are 1, 3, and 6.

5. Next, agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 3 (90).
6. Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 6 (47).
7. Agent 3 has the next highest valuation for item 1 (51).

Now, each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```
