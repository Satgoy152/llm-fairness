Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  88  70  46  72  20  77
1  61  44  31  42  75  39  74
2  16  80  98  45  59  77  94
3  90  27  42  11  32  46  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 88 70 46 72 20 77]
 [61 44 31 42 75 39 74]
 [16 80 98 45 59 77 94]
 [90 27 42 11 32 46 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent has for the items. Here's a potential allocation strategy using a greedy approach:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (88)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 6 (77)

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (75)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 6 (74) - Already taken by Agent 0, so skip to the next.
   - Next highest available: Item 0 (61)

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (98)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 6 (94) - Already taken, so skip to the next.
   - Next highest available: Item 5 (77)

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (90) - Already taken, so skip to the next.
   - Next highest available: Item 6 (93) - Already taken, so skip to the next.
   - Next highest available: Item 2 (42) - Already taken, so skip to the next.
   - Next highest available: Item 3 (11)

Reviewing the allocations, Agent 0 has two items, Agent 1 has two items, Agent 2 has two items, and Agent 3 has one item. This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
