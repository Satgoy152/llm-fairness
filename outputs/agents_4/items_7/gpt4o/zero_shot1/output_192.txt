Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  83  87  39  90  42  17
1   9  11   4  76  46  83  77
2  19  13  64  98  85  71  15
3  61  23  53  23  25  74  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 83 87 39 90 42 17]
 [ 9 11  4 76 46 83 77]
 [19 13 64 98 85 71 15]
 [61 23 53 23 25 74 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items with high valuations: 0 (63), 1 (83), 2 (87), 4 (90)
   - Allocate item 4 (highest value for Agent 0, value = 90)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items with high valuations: 3 (76), 5 (83), 6 (77)
   - Allocate item 5 (highest value for Agent 1, value = 83)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items with high valuations: 3 (98), 4 (85), 5 (71)
   - Allocate item 3 (highest value for Agent 2, value = 98)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items with high valuations: 6 (98)
   - Allocate item 6 (highest value for Agent 3, value = 98)

Now we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items.

5. **Back to Agent 0**:
   - Remaining high-valued items: 0 (63), 1 (83), 2 (87)
   - Allocate item 2 (value = 87)

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Remaining high-valued items: 6 (77)
   - Allocate item 6 (already allocated, so choose next)
   - Allocate item 1 (value = 11)

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate item 0 (value = 19)

Let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7.
