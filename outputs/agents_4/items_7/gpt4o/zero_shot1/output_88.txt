Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  42  95  28  11   1  28
1  25  88  33  29  75  81  39
2  39  33  67  23  44  62  38
3  72  42  69  67  17  52  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent's allocation considers their valuations. A feasible approach is to evaluate the highest value each agent has for an item, then allocate items based on maximizing the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (64) and 2 (95). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 1 (88) and 5 (81). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively lower valuations compared to the others, but item 5 (62) is significant for them. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (72) and item 3 (67). Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. For item 3, Agent 3 has a high valuation (67), so let's allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
6. For item 4, Agent 1 has a high valuation (75), so let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
7. Finally, item 6 can be allocated to Agent 2, who has a reasonable valuation (38) for it.

After ensuring all items are allocated, here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize satisfaction based on the given valuations, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are fairly distributed.
