Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  57  55  85  76  83  50
1  19  74  72  16  69  11  32
2  18  37  87  77  14   2  70
3  25  45  79  20  37  67  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation across all agents or distribute items such that each agent gets a relatively fair share based on their preferences. Let's try an approach that maximizes each agent's individual satisfaction by assigning items that each agent values highly, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Determine the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign items to agents based on their highest individual valuations, ensuring each item is only assigned once.
3. **Check for Fairness**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible. If an agent doesn't receive any items, consider reallocating less preferred items from other agents.

Based on the table provided, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 5, and 4.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 6.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 2, 5, and 1.

Starting with the highest valued items for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (value 85).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (value 74).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (value 87).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 5 (value 67).

Now, to allocate the remaining items (0, 4, 6):

- **Remaining Items**: 0, 4, 6
- Prioritize agents who have fewer total items or lower total valuation.
  
5. **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 (value 76) - high value for Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 (value 19) - low value but necessary for fairness.
7. **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 (value 70) - high value for Agent 2.

This ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to maximize their satisfaction based on their preferences.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
