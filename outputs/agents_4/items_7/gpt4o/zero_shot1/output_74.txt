Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  55  69  72  45  56  43
1  31  90   5  97  46  89  59
2  91   8   7  16  43  17  13
3  16  94  14  44  21  76  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple greedy algorithm. This involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can allocate the items:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent can receive an integer number of items.
4. Check that all items are allocated without exceeding the total number of items.

Let's apply this method to the given table:

- Item 0: Highest value is 91 by agent 2.
- Item 1: Highest value is 94 by agent 3.
- Item 2: Highest value is 69 by agent 0.
- Item 3: Highest value is 97 by agent 1.
- Item 4: Highest value is 46 by agent 1.
- Item 5: Highest value is 89 by agent 1.
- Item 6: Highest value is 59 by agent 1.

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```
