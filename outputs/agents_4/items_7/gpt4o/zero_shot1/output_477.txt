Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12   8  17  38  37  33  65
1  47  79  29  45  42  33  42
2  85  76   1  57  64   1  10
3  48   2  14  97  85  39  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [48  2 14 97 85 39 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we need to consider their valuations and distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 7 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring fairness in the distribution.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Agents**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (65).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (79).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (85).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (97).

2. **Allocate High-Value Items to Each Agent**:
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items are 2, 4, and 5.

4. **Continue Allocation Based on Remaining High Values**:
   - Agent 0 has high value for item 3, but it's already taken. Next high is item 5 (33), assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has high values for items 3 and 4. Item 3 is taken; assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 has high value for item 1, but it's taken. Next high is item 4, but it is taken; assign item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 has high value for item 4, but it's taken. Next high is item 0, but it's taken; assign item 2 to Agent 3, but it is taken, so no remaining options for Agent 3.

Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their valuation priorities, maximizing fairness and total valuation.
