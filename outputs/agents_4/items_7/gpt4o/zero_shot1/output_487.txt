Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  83  19   0  45  33  79
1  56  21  37  66  17  94  91
2  15  77  87  31  83  30  98
3  27  32  45  53  52  80  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to allocate 7 items to 4 agents based on their valuation of each item. Each agent should be assigned an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated should be 7.

2. **Identify High Valuations**: Start by identifying the highest valuations for each item across all agents, as this might help in maximizing the total satisfaction.

3. **Greedy Allocation**: Begin by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This is a greedy approach that generally works well for maximizing total valuations.

4. **Adjust for Fairness**: If some agents end up with significantly more items than others, adjust the allocation to ensure a more balanced distribution while trying to keep the total valuation high.

Let's assign the items based on the table:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (78).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (83).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (87).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by agent 1 (66).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (83).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation by agent 1 (94).
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (98).

However, this initial allocation leaves agent 3 without any items. We need to adjust to ensure fairness:

Adjusted allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Item 0, 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 3
- **Agent 2**: Item 2, 4, 6
- **Agent 3**: Item 5

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 7.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
