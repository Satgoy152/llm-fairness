Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  82   6  91  62  40  66
1  57  83  82  78  81  54  78
2  98  49  85  69  41   9  63
3  46  25  87   4   0  85  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, a common approach is to use an algorithm like the "max-min fairness" or "envy-free" allocation. However, given the constraints of this problem with integer items, a simple heuristic can be used.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Observation:**
   - We have 4 agents and 7 items.
   - Each item should be allocated to exactly one agent, and each agent should get an integer number of items.

2. **Allocation Process:**
   - Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it most.
   - If an agent ends up with more than one item, check if any other agent has no items and try to reallocate to balance the distribution.

3. **Allocation Steps:**
   - Item 0: Highest value is 98 by agent 2.
   - Item 1: Highest value is 83 by agent 1.
   - Item 2: Highest value is 87 by agent 3.
   - Item 3: Highest value is 91 by agent 0.
   - Item 4: Highest value is 81 by agent 1.
   - Item 5: Highest value is 85 by agent 3.
   - Item 6: Highest value is 78 by agent 1.

4. **Balancing the Allocation:**
   - Agent 1 has 3 items (1, 4, 6).
   - Agent 3 has 2 items (2, 5).
   - Agent 0 has 1 item (3).
   - Agent 2 has 1 item (0).
   - To balance, let's reallocate item 6 from agent 1 to agent 0, which values it second highest (66).

5. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

Here, the allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their initial valuations while keeping the distribution balanced with integer allocations for each agent.
