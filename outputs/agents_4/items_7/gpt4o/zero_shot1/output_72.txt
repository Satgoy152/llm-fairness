Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  16   3  27  46  12  91
1   3  46  88  64  46  48  75
2  37  51  35  96  95  16  74
3  87  43  68  92  54  99  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 16  3 27 46 12 91]
 [ 3 46 88 64 46 48 75]
 [37 51 35 96 95 16 74]
 [87 43 68 92 54 99 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. One way to approach this is by ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and trying to maximize the total value across all agents. Here is a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing the value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 with a value of 96.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 with a value of 88.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 3 with a value of 96.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 5 with a value of 99.

Now, we have allocated one item to each agent. We have 3 items left to allocate: items 1, 4, and 6.

5. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - **Item 6**: The highest remaining valuation for item 6 is Agent 0 with a value of 91.
   - **Item 4**: The highest remaining valuation for item 4 is Agent 2 with a value of 95.
   - **Item 1**: The highest remaining valuation for item 1 is Agent 2 with a value of 51.

Final allocations are based on maximizing the total valuation each agent can receive. Let's distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 4, and 1
- **Agent 3**: Item 5 

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4, 1],
    "3": [5]
}
```
