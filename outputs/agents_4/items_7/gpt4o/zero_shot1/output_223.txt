Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32   9  57  68  24  31  27
1   8  86  45  38  48  15  52
2  49  96  70  28  71  16  64
3  26  72   9  43  17  90  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total value while ensuring that all items are distributed. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items to agents based on their valuations.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Assign items to the agents who value them the most.
2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item**: If possible, each agent should receive at least one item to ensure fairness.
3. **Distribute Remaining Items**: Continue allocating the remaining items to agents in a way that maximizes their total value.

Here’s how the allocation can be done based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Values item 3 the most (68).
- Agent 1: Values item 1 the most (86).
- Agent 2: Values item 1 the most as well (96, but item 1 goes to agent 1), so we consider the next highest, item 4 (71).
- Agent 3: Values item 5 the most (90).

Now we assign the remaining items, ensuring each agent gets items that maximize their value:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 2 (49).
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (57).
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (27).

After these allocations, let’s present the result in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent is assigned items such that the total value each agent gets is maximized based on their individual valuations.
