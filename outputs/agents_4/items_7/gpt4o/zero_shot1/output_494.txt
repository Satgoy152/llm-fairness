Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  91  85  82  89  96  65
1   0  74  69   6   9   3  24
2  98  31  37  32  56  24  98
3  94   3  89  89  74  93  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56 91 85 82 89 96 65]
 [ 0 74 69  6  9  3 24]
 [98 31 37 32 56 24 98]
 [94  3 89 89 74 93 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring each gets at least one item, if possible. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for multiple items, especially item 5.
- Agent 1 has lower valuations overall, with item 1 being the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 0 and item 6 the most.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for item 0, 3, 5, and 2.

Let's attempt to allocate the items to maximize fairness:

1. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 0**: This is where Agent 0 has the highest valuation (96).

2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**: This is where Agent 1 has the highest valuation (74).

3. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 2**: This is where Agent 2 has the highest valuation (98).

4. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 3**: This matches a high valuation for Agent 3 (89).

5. **Allocate item 6 to Agent 2**: This is another very high valuation for Agent 2 (98).

6. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This is a high valuation (85) and helps balance allocations between Agent 0 and Agent 3.

7. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 3**: This is a decent valuation for Agent 3 (74).

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 5 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 6.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 4.

Now, presenting this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute items based on the valuations and ensures all items are distributed.
