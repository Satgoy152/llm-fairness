Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  93  83  89  79  61  79
1  33   9  48  83  45  85  61
2  84  90  34  69  54  86  75
3  77  13  47  32  87  44  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will take into account the valuations given in the table and try to allocate items in a way that balances the overall satisfaction.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by allocating the highest-valued items to the agents that value them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. Attempt to balance the total value received by each agent across all items.

Let's proceed with these steps:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1 (93), so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 5 (85), so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 as well, but since it's already allocated, we look for their next highest value, which is item 1 (90), but that's taken too. We'll move to their next preference.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (87), so we allocate item 4 to agent 3.
- Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item:
  - Agent 0 already has item 1.
  - Agent 1 already has item 5.
  - Agent 2 can receive item 0 (84).
  - Agent 3 already has item 4.

After ensuring each agent has at least one item, we continue to allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 2 (83) since it's one of their higher preferences.
- Agent 1 can take item 3 (83).
- Agent 2 can take item 6 (75).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and attempts to distribute the items based on the highest preferences while also balancing the overall distribution.
