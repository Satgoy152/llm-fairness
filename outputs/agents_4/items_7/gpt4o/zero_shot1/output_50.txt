Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  28  65  65  79  46  34
1  41  34  63  79  73  94  80
2  46  90  49  52  38   8  44
3   8  30  60  38  39  41  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items, with all 7 items allocated in total. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation for item 0 (81).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations for items 5 (94) and 3 (79).
   - Allocate items 5 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation for item 1 (90).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Remaining items 2, 4, and 6.
   - Allocate items 2, 4, and 6 to Agent 3 because Agent 3 has relatively balanced valuations across these items compared to others.

This allocation ensures a distribution that attempts to give each agent a share of items that they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated. The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This distribution is based on maximizing the sum of valuations for items each agent receives, attempting to balance fairness given the constraints.
