Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  70  49  52   6  10  29
1  40  60  25  26  57  82   2
2  36  12  46  29   9  76  73
3  81  59  69  73  28  23  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[29 70 49 52  6 10 29]
 [40 60 25 26 57 82  2]
 [36 12 46 29  9 76 73]
 [81 59 69 73 28 23 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that every agent receives a fair share of the total value of the items. This can be approached by attempting to maximize the minimum value each agent receives or by ensuring that each agent receives items that they value highly.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 29 + 70 + 49 + 52 + 6 + 10 + 29 = 245
- Agent 1: 40 + 60 + 25 + 26 + 57 + 82 + 2 = 292
- Agent 2: 36 + 12 + 46 + 29 + 9 + 76 + 73 = 281
- Agent 3: 81 + 59 + 69 + 73 + 28 + 23 + 12 = 345

Now, let's allocate items by aiming to balance the perceived value for each agent:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (70).
2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (82).
3. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (73).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3, as they value it the highest (73).
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3, as it also gives them a high value (81).
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 3, as they have a high value (69).
7. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it highly (57).

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
