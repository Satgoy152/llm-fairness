Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  92  59  91  55   0  98
1  58  36  21  97   0  96  87
2  24  41  24  65  19  53   9
3  98  34  40  76  47  57  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[48 92 59 91 55  0 98]
 [58 36 21 97  0 96 87]
 [24 41 24 65 19 53  9]
 [98 34 40 76 47 57 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. We'll consider each agent's highest-valued items first and try to distribute the items evenly.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [48, 92, 59, 91, 55, 0, 98]
- Agent 1: [58, 36, 21, 97, 0, 96, 87]
- Agent 2: [24, 41, 24, 65, 19, 53, 9]
- Agent 3: [98, 34, 40, 76, 47, 57, 66]

We'll try to allocate items by selecting the highest unallocated valued item for each agent, ensuring a fair distribution across all agents.

1. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 98).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (value 98).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 97).
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 96).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 92).
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 59).
7. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (value 47).

Now, each agent has been allocated the items with the highest possible values they can get, with the total number of items being 7. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
