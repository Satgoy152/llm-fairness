Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  70  27  61  36  18  11
1  98  92  96  22  35  10   7
2  26  72  61  81  93  80  11
3  17  90  77  42  70  45  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's proceed with the allocation.

Consider the following allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 0 among all agents.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 1 among all agents.
   - Item 2 is also highly valuable to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 and Item 5 are highly valuable to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 3 is highly valuable to Agent 3.
   - Item 6 is valuable enough for Agent 3 to complete the allocation.

Here's a potential fair allocation based on these considerations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent gets a fair chance based on their preferences, and no items are left unallocated.
