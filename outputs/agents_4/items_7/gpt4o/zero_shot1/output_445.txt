Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  59  57  61  31  88  76
1  18  20  92  50  59  61  51
2  54  74  82  94  61   5  65
3   7  56  40  46  47  90  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items that they value highly. One common approach is to use a method that maximizes the total sum of valuations across all agents, often referred to as a "maximum sum" or "utilitarian" allocation.

Let's analyze the given valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  59  57  61  31  88  76
1  18  20  92  50  59  61  51
2  54  74  82  94  61   5  65
3   7  56  40  46  47  90  23
```

We can assign the items to agents by considering the highest valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (62), Agent 2 (54), Agent 1 (18), Agent 3 (7) -> Assign to Agent 0
- Item 1: Agent 2 (74), Agent 0 (59), Agent 3 (56), Agent 1 (20) -> Assign to Agent 2
- Item 2: Agent 1 (92), Agent 2 (82), Agent 0 (57), Agent 3 (40) -> Assign to Agent 1
- Item 3: Agent 2 (94), Agent 0 (61), Agent 1 (50), Agent 3 (46) -> Assign to Agent 2
- Item 4: Agent 2 (61), Agent 1 (59), Agent 3 (47), Agent 0 (31) -> Assign to Agent 2
- Item 5: Agent 3 (90), Agent 0 (88), Agent 1 (61), Agent 2 (5) -> Assign to Agent 3
- Item 6: Agent 0 (76), Agent 2 (65), Agent 1 (51), Agent 3 (23) -> Assign to Agent 0

Now let's ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and only 7 items in total are allocated. Balancing the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 5

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item they value highly, maximizing overall satisfaction.
