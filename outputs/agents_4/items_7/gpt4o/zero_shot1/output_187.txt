Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  57  50  22  55  54  38
1  76  21   7  65  44  61  57
2  44   9  39  18   7  90  67
3  65  25  33   9  66  94  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[20 57 50 22 55 54 38]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value 20
   - Item 4: Value 55

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: Value 65
   - Item 6: Value 57

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 5: Value 90

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 1: Value 25
   - Item 2: Value 33

This allocation takes into account maximizing the values for the agents while ensuring all items are fairly distributed. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.
