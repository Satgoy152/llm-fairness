Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  76  25  75  17  18  13
1  96  57  67  78   4  23  69
2  51  94  77  98  93  27  32
3  19  54  79  68  35  91  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. 
2. Check if the allocation is fair (i.e., each agent should get at least one item where possible). If not, adjust the allocation to ensure fairness while maintaining as high a value as possible for each agent.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 94.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 79.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 93.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most at 91.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 69.

Now, let's check if each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: 0 items
- Agent 1: 2 items (0, 6)
- Agent 2: 3 items (1, 3, 4)
- Agent 3: 2 items (2, 5)

We need to reallocate to ensure Agent 0 gets at least one item. Let's adjust:

- Move item 0 from Agent 1 to Agent 0.

Now, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: 1 item (0)
- Agent 1: 1 item (6)
- Agent 2: 3 items (1, 3, 4)
- Agent 3: 2 items (2, 5)

This allocation is fair and ensures all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
