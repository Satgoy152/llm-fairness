Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  75  42  77  59  19  67
1  58  14  89  12  55  16  74
2  69  56  87  30  27  62  49
3  46  94  42   1  84  34  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 75 42 77 59 19 67]
 [58 14 89 12 55 16 74]
 [69 56 87 30 27 62 49]
 [46 94 42  1 84 34 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that seeks to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible given the total number of items) and that all items are allocated.

Let's review the valuations given:

- Agent 0: [67, 75, 42, 77, 59, 19, 67]
- Agent 1: [58, 14, 89, 12, 55, 16, 74]
- Agent 2: [69, 56, 87, 30, 27, 62, 49]
- Agent 3: [46, 94, 42, 1, 84, 34, 41]

We'll try to allocate the items in a way that each agent receives the highest possible value based on their preferences.

One possible allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 77).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 89).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 69).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 94).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 84).
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 74).
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 62).

This allocation aims to give each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives items.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
