Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  61  96  56  78   2  42
1  96  59  65  67  56  86  23
2   2  27  79   4  98  43  20
3  98  36  99   1  24  43   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[46 61 96 56 78  2 42]
 [96 59 65 67 56 86 23]
 [ 2 27 79  4 98 43 20]
 [98 36 99  1 24 43  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations while also considering an integer number of items per agent. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Identify high-value items for each agent and try to allocate them accordingly.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
3. Balance the allocation by considering both the total value and the number of items each agent receives.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0: Valuations are [46, 61, 96, 56, 78, 2, 42]. The highest-valued items are 2 (96) and 4 (78). Assign items 2 and 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Valuations are [96, 59, 65, 67, 56, 86, 23]. The highest-valued item is 0 (96), followed by 5 (86). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Valuations are [2, 27, 79, 4, 98, 43, 20]. The highest-valued item is 4 (98). Since item 4 is already allocated, assign item 6 (20) to Agent 2.
- Agent 3: Valuations are [98, 36, 99, 1, 24, 43, 1]. The highest-valued item is 2 (99), which is already taken. The next highest is 0 (98), which is also taken. Therefore, assign item 5 (43) to Agent 3.

Revisiting to ensure all 7 items are allocated and balance:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 for balance.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Items 3, 6
- Agent 3: Item 5

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
