Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  58  87  74  67  73  52
1  27  29  15  83  98  36  18
2  70  48  86  25  14  57  88
3  12  57  79  90  79  13  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation of items each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Evaluate each agent's valuation for the items.
2. Start by giving each agent the item they value the most.
3. If conflicts arise (i.e., two agents value the same item the most), compare the next highest values for each agent.
4. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Here is one way to allocate the items:
- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for item 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 6.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for item 3.

Now let's implement this:

1. Agent 0 gets item 2 (highest valuation for Agent 0).
2. Agent 1 gets item 4 (highest valuation for Agent 1).
3. Agent 2 gets items 0 and 6 (two high valuations for Agent 2).
4. Agent 3 gets item 3 (highest valuation for Agent 3).
5. Distribute remaining items (1 and 5) based on the next highest valuations.

Remaining items:
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 3 at 57. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 36, Agent 2 at 57, Agent 3 at 13. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 6
- Agent 3: Item 3

Now, present the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3]
}
```
