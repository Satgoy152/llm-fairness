Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20   1  97  91   0  90  23
1  72  12  36  60  52  58  97
2  32   9  51  14  51  85  86
3  72   4  52  44  91  51  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are assigned. Each agent can receive at least one item, but no agent should receive more items than necessary. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items are 2 (97) and 3 (91).
   - Assign item 2 (highest value) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items are 6 (97) and 0 (72).
   - Assign item 6 (highest value) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items are 6 (86) and 5 (85), but item 6 is already taken.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items are 4 (91) and 0 or 1 (72).
   - Assign item 4 (highest value) to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

5. **Remaining items**: 0, 1, 3

6. **Assign item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 72, and Agent 3 does too.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (maximizing their total value).

7. **Assign item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 at 12, Agent 2 at 9, and Agent 3 at 4.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value).

8. **Assign item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 60, Agent 2 at 14, and Agent 3 at 44.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value).

With all items allocated, here is the final distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [6, 0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
