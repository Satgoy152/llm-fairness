Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  55  39  74  17  26  82
1  26  63  89  26   7  12  27
2  15  37  57  33  56  39  15
3  51  54  65  45  75  84  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item. Since there are more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

First, let's look at the values each agent assigns to items and try to make assignments based on maximizing the total value for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Values items as [76, 55, 39, 74, 17, 26, 82]
- Agent 1: Values items as [26, 63, 89, 26, 7, 12, 27]
- Agent 2: Values items as [15, 37, 57, 33, 56, 39, 15]
- Agent 3: Values items as [51, 54, 65, 45, 75, 84, 84]

Let's allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items for each agent:

   - Agent 0 should take item 6 (value 82).
   - Agent 1 should take item 2 (value 89).
   - Agent 2 should take item 4 (value 56).
   - Agent 3 should take item 5 (value 84).

2. Allocate remaining items:

   - Agent 0 can take item 0 (value 76).
   - Agent 3 can take item 3 (value 45).
   - Agent 3 can take item 1 (value 54).

Now each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
