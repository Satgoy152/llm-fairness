Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  61  23  44  73   4  46
1  73  42  67  21  89   7  96
2  23  51  34  82   4  15   0
3  36   7  87  65  23  15  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. To achieve this, we can use the following approach:

1. Assess each agent's highest-valued items.
2. Try to allocate items so that each agent gets a fair share, considering their preferences and the total availability of items.

Let's analyze the table to understand the highest-valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0: Highest valuations are for items 4 (73) and 1 (61).
- Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 6 (96) and 4 (89).
- Agent 2: Highest valuations are for items 3 (82) and 1 (51).
- Agent 3: Highest valuations are for items 2 (87) and 3 (65).

Now let's try to allocate the items based on these preferences:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for this item).
2. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for this item).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 (highest value for this item).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (second-highest value and next highest preference).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value after preferences of other agents).
6. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (only item left with some value for Agent 0).
7. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 (next available item with some value).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences and maximizes the total value distributed among all agents while ensuring all items are allocated.
