Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  19  17  25  53  96  48
1  23  62  54  11  78  71  10
2  40  35  47  30  39  67  41
3  74  67  98  30  46  15  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 67 98 30 46 15 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we can use a simple heuristic to maximize the total value for each agent. One straightforward approach is the "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that hasn't been taken yet. 

Here's how the allocation could go:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most (96), so they choose item 5.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (78), so they choose item 4.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most, but it's already taken, so they choose their next best, item 5 (67), but it's taken, next item 6 (41).
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the most (98), so they choose item 2.
5. Agent 0 chooses their next highest available item, item 0 (82).
6. Agent 1 chooses their next highest available item, item 1 (62).
7. Agent 2 chooses their next highest available item, item 3 (30).

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations while distributing all 7 items.
