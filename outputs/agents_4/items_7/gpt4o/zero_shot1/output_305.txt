Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  87  25  76  24  52  18
1  65  18  77  78  41  79  63
2  35  29  97  39  47  17  89
3  74  71  61  70  94  66  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[39 87 25 76 24 52 18]
 [65 18 77 78 41 79 63]
 [35 29 97 39 47 17 89]
 [74 71 61 70 94 66 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item since there are more items than agents.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (87)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (79)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (97)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (94)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and we have 3 items left (0, 3, 6) to allocate among the agents.

5. Consider the remaining allocations:
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for Item 3 (76), allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for Item 6 (63), allocate Item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 has a reasonable valuation for Item 0 (35), allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

So, the allocation can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.
