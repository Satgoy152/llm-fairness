Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  19  15  92  12  14  71
1  36  74  49  78  35  99  66
2  83  74  89   9  36  34  41
3  99   4  61  90  19  11  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize their satisfaction while distributing all items. We can use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 3, as they have the highest valuation for item 0 (99).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for item 1 (74).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for item 2 (89).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for item 3 (92).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for item 4 (35).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for item 5 (99).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 3, as they have the highest valuation for item 6 (95).

Based on this allocation, the JSON representation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 3 gets items 0 and 6. 

This ensures that all 7 items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
