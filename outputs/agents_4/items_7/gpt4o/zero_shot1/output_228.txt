Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  97  45  63  75  50  71
1  88  90  45  43  60  33   7
2  65  38   1   8  12  78  54
3  93  56  53  28  44  66  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Identify High-valued Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 1 (97) and 4 (75).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for items 0 (88) and 1 (90).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are for items 5 (78) and 0 (65).
   - Agent 3: Highest values are for items 0 (93) and 6 (90).

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Values:**
   - Start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item that isn't already taken.

3. **Resolve Conflicts and Finalize Allocation:**
   - We need to ensure each item is only allocated once, and each agent gets a fair allocation based on their valuations.

Here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 (97), 4 (75)
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 (88), 3 (43)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (78)
- **Agent 3**: Items 6 (90), 2 (53)

This allocation maximizes the value for each agent based on their highest preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the json format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```
