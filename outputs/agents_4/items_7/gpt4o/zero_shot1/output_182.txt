Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  23  88  48   0  54  64
1  36  82  53  50  73  33  83
2  66  29  61  63  61  22  74
3   0  70  28  87  31  61  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Below is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Analyze the highest valuations for each item across agents to determine the best allocation.
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7, with each agent potentially receiving at least one item.

Let's go through the items and allocate them based on who values them the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 82.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 88.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 87.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 73.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 54.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 83.

Now, based on these valuations, we can allocate the items fairly as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 2, 5].
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 4, 6].
- Agent 3 gets item [3].
- Agent 2 does not receive any items.

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each item goes to the agent that values it the most, given the constraints.
