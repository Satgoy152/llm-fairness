Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  97  20  73   8  21  83
1  99  83  88  51  70  54  39
2  77  16  22  26  35   9  68
3  73  52  98  67  84  89  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one common method is to use a variation of the "maximum sum of valuations" approach. This aims to allocate items such that the overall satisfaction (or total valuation) is maximized. Each agent should receive at least one item if possible, given that we have 4 agents and 7 items to allocate.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (97), Item 0 (75)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (99), Item 2 (88)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (77), Item 6 (68)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (98), Item 5 (89)

Considering these valuations and aiming to distribute the items fairly, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Receives Item 1 and Item 3 (valuations: 97, 73)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Receives Item 0 and Item 4 (valuations: 99, 70)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Receives Item 6 (valuation: 68)

- **Agent 3**: 
  - Receives Item 2 and Item 5 (valuations: 98, 89)

By summing the valuations for each allocation, we ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is reasonably fair based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
