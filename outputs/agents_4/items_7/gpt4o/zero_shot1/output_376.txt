Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  24  66  39  34   2  55
1  66  35  91  44  36  72  32
2  69  31  52  16  77  90  82
3   0  55  85  27  90  92  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 24 66 39 34  2 55]
 [66 35 91 44 36 72 32]
 [69 31 52 16 77 90 82]
 [ 0 55 85 27 90 92 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value 25
   - Item 6: Value 55
   - Total Value: 80

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2: Value 91
   - Item 4: Value 36
   - Total Value: 127

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 5: Value 90
   - Total Value: 90

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 1: Value 55
   - Item 3: Value 27
   - Total Value: 82

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations while ensuring that all 7 items are allocated.

The JSON format for this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
