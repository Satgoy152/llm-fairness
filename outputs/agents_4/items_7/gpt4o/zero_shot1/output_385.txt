Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  10  25  17  95   5  89
1  45   2  89  29  18  28  28
2  24  95  26  74  20  29  63
3  20  73  15  49  49  55  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We'll analyze the valuations for each agent and attempt a fair distribution.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [84, 10, 25, 17, 95, 5, 89]
- Agent 1: [45, 2, 89, 29, 18, 28, 28]
- Agent 2: [24, 95, 26, 74, 20, 29, 63]
- Agent 3: [20, 73, 15, 49, 49, 55, 66]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first to ensure that they receive their most valued item.
2. Distribute the remaining items based on maximizing the overall valuation for each agent or ensuring a balanced distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 95).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 89).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 95).
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value 66).

The remaining items are [0, 3, 5]. We will now allocate these in a manner that continues to provide benefit:

5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 84).
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 74).
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (value 55).

This allocation ensures each agent gets items based on their highest perceived value, and we only allocate 7 items in total:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [6, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance between maximizing individual agent satisfaction with their allocations and distributing all items.
