Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  83  72  86  96  68  78
1  52  72  35  62  55  59  67
2  93  89  41  88  68  63  70
3  47  96  28  72  69  59  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 96 28 72 69 59 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring everyone gets a fair share of the items. Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, not every agent will get an equal number of items, but we can attempt to distribute them as evenly as possible.

Let's look at the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations on items 3 and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation on item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations on items 0 and 3.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuations on items 1 and 3.

A possible allocation strategy could be:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 96).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 96).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 93).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 86).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 63).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 35).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 67).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and tries to maximize the valuation for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```
