Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  30   8  66  74  67  83
1  79  21  41  19  11  72   9
2  57  70  59  63  66  31  56
3  50  52  26  82  92   2   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 52 26 82 92  2  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 6. Let's assign item 0 to agent 0, as it has the highest value for this agent.

2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest value for item 5. Let's assign item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 4. Let's assign item 1 to agent 2, as it is the highest value available for this agent.

4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest value for item 3, and no other agent values item 3 more than agent 3. Let's assign item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items**: Items 2, 4, and 6 are left unallocated. Let's allocate these to maximize their values for the remaining agents:
   - Item 4 is highly valued by agent 3, so assign it to agent 3.
   - Item 2 is most valued by agent 2, so assign it to agent 2.
   - Item 6 is most valued by agent 0, so assign it to agent 0.

Now, here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
