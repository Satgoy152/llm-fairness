Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  92  33   4  21  44  10
1  38  55  16  44  48  16  32
2  77  26  87  16  62  21  35
3  39  48  23  58  65  20  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39 48 23 58 65 20 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and consider their valuations. A possible approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the items and allocate them based on the highest valuation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest at 77.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 92.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest at 87.
4. Item 3: Agent 3 values it the highest at 58.
5. Item 4: Agent 3 values it the highest at 65.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest at 44.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the highest at 32 (since it's the only item left and agent 1 hasn't received any items yet).

Now, let's check the allocation to ensure fairness and that all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2
- Agent 3: Items 3, 4

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
