Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0   4   9  13  34  10  68
1  81  65  94  23   9  97  65
2  58  65  56   9  20  81   9
3  16  61   4   6   4   3  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items while also ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation approach using a greedy method to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 6, 4
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 5, 2, 0
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 5, 1, 0
   - Item 5 is already allocated, allocate item 1 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 6, 1, 0
   - Item 6 is already allocated, item 1 is already allocated, allocate item 0 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 5, and 6. We still need to allocate items 2, 3, and 4.

5. **Remaining items**:
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (next highest value).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (next highest value).
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 3 (next highest value).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
