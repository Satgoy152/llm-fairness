Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  78   1  16  73  89  53
1  48  13  78  24  10  48  98
2  52  41  43  50  38  79  10
3   1  45  49  13  99  64   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can use a strategy where each agent gets at least one item, and we try to maximize the total value each agent receives. One possible approach is to ensure each agent's allocation reflects their preferences as much as possible, given the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them (value = 89).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them (value = 98).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2, but since it's already taken, choose the next highest available, which is item 1 (value = 41).
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as it has the highest value for them (value = 99).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 2, 3) to balance the distribution:

5. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value = 52), as it gives them a decent value.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 78), which is the highest remaining value for them.
7. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value = 16), as it's the highest remaining value for them.

Now, let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items, and we try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
