Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81   6  33  28  15  32  26
1  75  99  23  91  69  92  69
2   8  47  58  20  59  19  97
3  68  72   3  13  34  86   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81  6 33 28 15 32 26]
 [75 99 23 91 69 92 69]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, while ensuring that each item is only assigned to one agent.

We will use a strategy to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: Item 0 (81), Item 2 (33)
 
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: Item 1 (99), Item 3 (91)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: Item 6 (97), Item 2 (58)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value items: Item 5 (86), Item 1 (72)

### Iterative Allocation:
- Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each item is allocated only once.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 (81), 4 (15)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 (99), 3 (91)
- **Agent 2**: Items 6 (97)
- **Agent 3**: Items 2 (3), 5 (86)

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation considers maximizing each agent's satisfaction by assigning them items with the highest value to them, ensuring that each item is allocated once and each agent receives a fair share.
