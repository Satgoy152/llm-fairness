Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  67  59  34  47  74  56
1  57  11  17  49  87  76  53
2  98  42  32  71  27  85  23
3  82  48  72  28  14  36  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for the items. A common approach is to use a method like the "greedy allocation" strategy, where we allocate items one by one, giving each item to the agent who values it the most (or potentially other fair division methods depending on the goal). However, we'll try to distribute the items as evenly as possible while maximizing the agents' valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each agent's value for individual items:

1. Look for the highest valuation for each item and assign that item to the corresponding agent if they have not already received a fair share of items.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0 has the highest value of 98 for Agent 2.
- Item 1 has the highest value of 67 for Agent 0.
- Item 2 has the highest value of 72 for Agent 3.
- Item 3 has the highest value of 71 for Agent 2.
- Item 4 has the highest value of 87 for Agent 1.
- Item 5 has the highest value of 85 for Agent 2.
- Item 6 has the highest value of 56 for Agent 0.

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 2 already has items 0, 3, and 5.
- Agent 0 has items 1 and 6.
- Agent 3 has item 2.
- Agent 1 has item 4.

Since all agents have at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated, the allocation is complete.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```
