Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  71  26  76  80  14  53
1  34  32  65  36  79  93  75
2   9  43  62  40  49  64  85
3  58  19   9  19  67  55  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize each agent's total satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent places on any item.
2. Assign each agent one of their highest-valued items.
3. Allocate the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Assignment
- Agent 0: Item 4 (Value = 80)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (Value = 93)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (Value = 85)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (Value = 58)

### Step 2: Allocate Remaining Items
Now, we need to allocate the remaining items [1, 2, 3] to maximize the total value.

- **Item 1:**
  - Agent 0: Value = 71
  - Agent 1: Value = 32
  - Agent 2: Value = 43
  - Agent 3: Value = 19

  Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (Value = 71).

- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 0: Value = 26
  - Agent 1: Value = 65
  - Agent 2: Value = 62
  - Agent 3: Value = 9

  Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (Value = 65).

- **Item 3:**
  - Agent 0: Value = 76
  - Agent 1: Value = 36
  - Agent 2: Value = 40
  - Agent 3: Value = 19

  Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (Value = 76).

### Final Allocation

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 3],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and attempts to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences.
