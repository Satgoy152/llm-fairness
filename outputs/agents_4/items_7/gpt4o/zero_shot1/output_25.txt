Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  16  27  65  22  11  26
1  44  61   0  22  77  70  90
2  62   8   2  64   7  54  94
3  49  76  80  20  29  77  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the preferences and valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [1, 16, 27, 65, 22, 11, 26]
- Agent 1 values: [44, 61, 0, 22, 77, 70, 90]
- Agent 2 values: [62, 8, 2, 64, 7, 54, 94]
- Agent 3 values: [49, 76, 80, 20, 29, 77, 48]

We will assign items to agents by considering the highest value for each item across all agents. This is a straightforward heuristic to maximize individual agent satisfaction.

Step 1: Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 90)
Step 2: Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 65)
Step 3: Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 76)
Step 4: Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 77)
Step 5: Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (value 77)
Step 6: Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value 80)
Step 7: Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 62)

Thus, the allocation of the items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, while all 7 items are distributed fairly.
