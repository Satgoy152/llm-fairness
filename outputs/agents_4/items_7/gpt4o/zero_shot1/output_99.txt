Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  44  44  79  35  56  39
1   5  67  71  36  92  16  91
2   7  63   4  81  29  44  49
3  24  69  88  69  51  77  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The allocation should also consider the preferences of the agents as indicated by their valuation of each item. 

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Determine the highest value each agent places on an item and see if any of these items can be exclusively assigned to maximize total utility.

2. **Assign Unique High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly (79).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (92).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 highly but lower than Agent 0, so item 3 should remain with Agent 0.
   - Agent 3 values item 2 highly (88).

3. **Consider Remaining Items:**
   - After assigning the high-value items, consider the remaining items and their values for each agent.
   - Allocate these remaining items to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring the total number of items allocated matches the total available.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items Fairly:**
   - Use a fair distribution strategy, such as ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, and try to balance the total value received by each agent.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Check that all items are allocated and each agent is considered.

Based on the above strategy, here is a possible allocation of the items:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 3, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 6, both of which they value considerably.
- Agent 2 takes item 5.
- Agent 3 receives items 0, 1, and 2, maximizing their total value.
