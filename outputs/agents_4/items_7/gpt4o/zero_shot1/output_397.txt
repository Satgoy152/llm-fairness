Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  51  96  23  46  54  14
1  75  73  13  42  23  24  19
2  86  39  56  99  28  11  66
3  27   4  87  53  27  31   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing total welfare by assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they receive. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we iteratively assign the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's begin the allocation process:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 93. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 51. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 96. Assign item 2 to agent 0.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 99. Assign item 3 to agent 2.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 46. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 54. Assign item 5 to agent 0.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 66. Assign item 6 to agent 2.

Now let's ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0 has items 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Agent 1 currently has no items. We can reassign item 1 to Agent 1, as they have the second highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has items 3 and 6.
- Agent 3 currently has no items. We can reassign item 0 to Agent 3, as they have the second highest valuation for item 0.

Now let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 3, 6
- Agent 3: Item 0

The allocation can now be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0]
}
```
