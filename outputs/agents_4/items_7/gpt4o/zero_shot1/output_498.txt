Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  17  45   1  90  55  38
1  61  88  78  75  36  35  43
2  18  83  46  45  64  55  96
3  45   9  93  14  94  44  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[23 17 45  1 90 55 38]
 [61 88 78 75 36 35 43]
 [18 83 46 45 64 55 96]
 [45  9 93 14 94 44 70]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's look at a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 90).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 88).
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 6 (value 96).
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 4, which is already taken. Next highest is item 2 (value 93).

Considering these initial allocations, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 has the second highest valuation (61) for item 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (75) for item 3.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 has the second highest valuation (55) for item 5.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and all items are allocated.
