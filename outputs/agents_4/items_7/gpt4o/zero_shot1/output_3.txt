Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  74  31   9  97  64  23
1  61  54  11  90  73  56  32
2  42   1  43  76   6  49  67
3  18  40   8  18  49  89  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 54 11 90 73 56 32]

 [18 40  8 18 49 89 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent has for the items. We will allocate items such that each agent receives at least one item and the total value across all agents is reasonably balanced.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for item 4 (97) and item 1 (74)
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 3 (90)
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 6 (67) and item 2 (43)
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 5 (89)

Let's allocate items as follows while ensuring fairness:

- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [2, 6]
- Agent 3: [4, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total value is distributed as evenly as possible given the individual valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
