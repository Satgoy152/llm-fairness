Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  40  84  87  92  91  10
1   1  86  36  58  73  39  76
2   3  96  25  64  37  32  31
3  53  33  96  42  77  26  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[38 40 84 87 92 91 10]
 [ 1 86 36 58 73 39 76]
 [ 3 96 25 64 37 32 31]
 [53 33 96 42 77 26 98]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Assign the highest value items to respective agents**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (92), so assign item 4 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (86), so assign item 1 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most (96), but it is already assigned to agent 1. The next highest value for agent 2 is item 3 (64), so assign item 3 to agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 6 the most (98), so assign item 6 to agent 3.

2. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Items 0, 2, and 5 are left unallocated.
   - Assign item 2 (highest left value for agent 0) to agent 0 (value: 84).
   - Assign item 0 (highest left value for agent 3) to agent 3 (value: 53).
   - Assign item 5 (highest left value for agent 0) to agent 0 (value: 91).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
