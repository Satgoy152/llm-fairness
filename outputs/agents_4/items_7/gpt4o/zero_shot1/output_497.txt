Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8   2  92  12  26  50  53
1  13  20   2  66  18  31  29
2  76  81  70   7   4  29  46
3  16  86  87  53  12  61  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. We will consider various allocations and select one that seems fair and balanced.

First, let's analyze the highest value each agent places on the items:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 92.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 66.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 81.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the second highest at 87 (after item 1).

Considering these preferences, we can start assigning items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is as balanced as possible. Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 since it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 since it is the highest value available after the top choices are made.

Next, we distribute the remaining items (4, 5, 6) to ensure fairness:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 as it brings significant additional value (50) and they have only one item so far.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3, who currently has the lowest total value assigned.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it adds more value to their allocation.

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of the total value and ensures all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the total number of items allocated equals 7.
