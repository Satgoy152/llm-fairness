Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  49  47  31  15  13   9
1  85  70  25  54  35  18  87
2  25   5  68   4  53  11  62
3  52  19  58  45  10   1  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents where each agent can have an integer number of items, one possible approach is to prioritize maximizing the total valuation for each agent. This can be done by considering each item and allocating it to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (85)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (49)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 2 (68)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (54)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 2 (53)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (13)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 1 (87)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 1
2. **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 0
3. **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 2
4. **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 1
5. **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 2
6. **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 0
7. **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 1

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 5]
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 4]
- Agent 3 receives no items

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": []
}
```
