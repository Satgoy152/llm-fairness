Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  43  23  10  87  27  93
1  97  82  15  86  62  22  54
2  35  36  84  56  28  41  34
3  86  92  11  37  61  71  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Let's use a greedy approach to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (93), Item 4 (87)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (97), Item 3 (86)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (84), Item 5 (41)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (92)

Now, let's allocate the items based on these valuations. We'll pick the highest value items for each agent, ensuring each item is only allocated once:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 3
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0

Thus, the allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring each item is allocated only once is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item.
