Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  68  58  75  82  53  90
1  50  26  20  94  80  64   8
2  68  47  80  51  66  70  74
3  35  86  21  74  47  28  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we aim to maximize the value each agent gets from the items assigned to them, while ensuring that all 7 items are distributed among the 4 agents. 

One approach is to use the "Round-Robin" method, where items are assigned one by one to the agent that values them the most, avoiding any conflicts until all items are allocated. Let's follow this approach:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Values: [70, 50, 68, 35]
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (value 70)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Values: [68, 26, 47, 86]
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (value 86)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Values: [58, 20, 80, 21]
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (value 80)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Values: [75, 94, 51, 74]
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (value 94)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Values: [82, 80, 66, 47]
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (value 82)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5:** 
   - Values: [53, 64, 70, 28]
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (value 70)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

7. **Item 6:** 
   - Values: [90, 8, 74, 26]
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (value 90)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

Based on this allocation method, here is the final assignment of items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all items are distributed among the agents.
