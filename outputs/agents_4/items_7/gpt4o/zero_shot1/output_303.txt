Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  38  42  38  37  43  88
1  41  25  26  31  86  32  16
2  17  65  83  91  91  79  95
3  18  61  47   0  88  59  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 61 47  0 88 59 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable distribution based on their preferences. Since there are 7 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but we should aim for a distribution that reflects their valuations as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 6 (88) and 5 (43).
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4 (86).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 6 (95), 3 (91), and 4 (91).
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4 (88).

We can try to allocate items based on these observations:

1. **Agent 2**: Since Agent 2 has the highest total valuation across items, we give them the highest-valued item 6 (95) and another high-value item 3 (91).
2. **Agent 1**: We give item 4 (86) to Agent 1 since it is highly valued by them and is their highest valuation.
3. **Agent 0**: We give item 5 (43) to Agent 0, as it is their second highest after item 6, which is already allocated.
4. **Agent 3**: We give item 1 (61) to Agent 3, as it is their highest valuation after item 4, which is already allocated.
5. **Agent 0**: We give item 0 (24) to Agent 0, as they have no high remaining valuations, and this item is not highly valued by others.
6. **Agent 1**: We give item 2 (26) to Agent 1, as it is not highly valued by others.
7. **Agent 3**: We give item 3 (0) to Agent 3, as it is the last remaining item and has zero value to them, but it's the only allocation possible without changing others.

Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
