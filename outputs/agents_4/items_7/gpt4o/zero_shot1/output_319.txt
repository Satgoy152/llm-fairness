Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  84  77  23  56  70  55
1  11  79  90   4  83  54  76
2  43  75  47  34  43  73  37
3  18  47  62  26  11  95  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 79 90  4 83 54 76]

 [18 47 62 26 11 95 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuation for the items. We can use a greedy approach to assign the items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 0 (88), 1 (84), and 2 (77).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (90), 4 (83), and 6 (76).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (75) and 5 (73).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 5 (95) and 2 (62).

To ensure a fair allocation, we will assign items to agents based on their highest preference while ensuring only one agent gets each item. We will adjust for overlaps by considering alternate high-value items for each agent.

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it the most and Agent 0 already has two items).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (as Agent 2 has no items yet).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (as it is their second-highest valued item).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 values it the most).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it high and Agent 1 has fewer items).

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with no item allocated more than once, and all 7 items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5]
}
```
