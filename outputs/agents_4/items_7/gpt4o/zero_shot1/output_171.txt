Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  81  44  37  59  52  84
1  36  97  44  40  73  71  40
2  84  54  20  27  66   1   1
3  47  59  97  44  97  90  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total utility across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 4 agents and 7 items, a simple way to allocate items fairly is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and one agent receives two items. We can use a greedy approach to allocate based on the highest valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Start by assigning each agent one item by identifying the highest value for each agent:

    - Agent 0: Highest value is 87 (item 0)
    - Agent 1: Highest value is 97 (item 1)
    - Agent 2: Highest value is 84 (item 0), but item 0 is already taken by agent 0. Next highest is 66 (item 4)
    - Agent 3: Highest value is 97 (item 2)

2. Now, remaining items are 3, 5, and 6. We need to assign these items considering the next highest valuations:

    - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 as their next highest value is 37 (item 3)
    - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 as their next highest value is 71 (item 5)
    - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 as their next highest value is 84 (item 6)

3. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7.
