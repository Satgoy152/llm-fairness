Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  22  57  34  58  80  82
1  33  34  94  86  84  69  55
2  88  24   2   3  75  45  28
3  31   8  71  21  99  96  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider different approaches such as maximizing total valuation, ensuring each agent is satisfied with their allocation, or balancing the number of items each agent receives. For simplicity and fairness, let's try to allocate items such that the total valuations are somewhat balanced.

Let's start by looking at the valuations and organizing the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: 80 (Item 5), 82 (Item 6), 58 (Item 4)
   - Assign Item 5 and Item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: 94 (Item 2), 86 (Item 3)
   - Assign Item 2 and Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: 88 (Item 0), 75 (Item 4)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: 99 (Item 4), 96 (Item 5), 71 (Item 2)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated Items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Item 1 is left.

5. **Agent 1:** 
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, since it gives a balanced allocation of total value.

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
