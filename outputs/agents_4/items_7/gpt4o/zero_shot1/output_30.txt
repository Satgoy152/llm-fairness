Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  86  46  61  98  96   3
1  87  92  18  20  93  74  32
2   1  36  58  75  37  30  27
3  39  99  42  43  47  25   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 92 18 20 93 74 32]

 [39 99 42 43 47 25  1]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 7 items are distributed. One approach is to maximize the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [49, 86, 46, 61, 98, 96, 3]
- Agent 1: [87, 92, 18, 20, 93, 74, 32]
- Agent 2: [1, 36, 58, 75, 37, 30, 27]
- Agent 3: [39, 99, 42, 43, 47, 25, 1]

A reasonable allocation strategy is to assign items based on the highest value each item has for any agent. Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Highest value is for Agent 1 (87)
2. Item 1: Highest value is for Agent 3 (99)
3. Item 2: Highest value is for Agent 0 (46)
4. Item 3: Highest value is for Agent 2 (75)
5. Item 4: Highest value is for Agent 0 (98)
6. Item 5: Highest value is for Agent 0 (96)
7. Item 6: Highest value is for Agent 1 (32)

Now let's ensure all items are fairly distributed, keeping the number of items balanced:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 3
- Assign Items 2, 4, and 5 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1

This allocation gives:

Agent 0: 3 items (2, 4, 5)
Agent 1: 2 items (0, 6)
Agent 2: 1 item (3)
Agent 3: 1 item (1)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
