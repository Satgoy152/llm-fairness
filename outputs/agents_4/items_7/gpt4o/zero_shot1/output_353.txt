Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  46  75  38  65  47  24
1  34  15  35  29  33  48  11
2  31  86  64  64   5  34  89
3  60  64  17  79  58  75  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations and ensure that the allocation is as balanced as possible. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent can receive zero or more items.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (75).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (48).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (89).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (79).

To balance the allocation across the agents, we need to consider the next highest valued items for each agent. Let's allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (47).
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (15).
- Agent 2 gets item 4 (5).
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (79) and gets item 6 (95) because it is the highest value among all agents.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 4 agents, taking into account their valuations as fairly as possible.
