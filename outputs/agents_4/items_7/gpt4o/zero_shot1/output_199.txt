Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  61  91  47  15  76  42
1  78  85  98  43  50  10  41
2  33  52   6  92   6  50  26
3  15  34   6  86  61  26  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 85 98 43 50 10 41]

 [15 34  6 86 61 26 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign items based on each agent's highest valuation that hasn't been assigned yet, ensuring each agent receives a reasonable allocation.

Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (91), so we assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (98), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 1 (85), so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (92), so we assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (86), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 4 (61), so we assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining items to maximize the valuation:

5. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 as it provides a high valuation (78) and gives them a second item.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 as it provides a high valuation (76) and gives them a second item.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 3 as it provides a reasonable valuation (36) and gives them a second item.

With these allocations, all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations while using all items in the table.
