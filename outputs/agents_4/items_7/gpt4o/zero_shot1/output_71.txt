Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  52  30  82   3  20  10
1   3  92  61  75  78  19  53
2  16  65  15  15  69  30  71
3  92  16  43  80  53  74  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and aim to maximize overall satisfaction. One common approach is to use a method like the "maximum marginal return" or "envy-free" allocation where each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Let's examine the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 92.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 92.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 61.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 82.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 78.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 74.

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 71.

To ensure that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is as balanced as possible, let's adjust the allocation slightly:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Items 0, 2, and 5

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
