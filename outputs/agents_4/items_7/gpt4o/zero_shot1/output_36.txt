Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  60   2  51  10  38  50
1  19  56  42  76  72  45  14
2  60  67   9  33  43  30  43
3  36  14  69  20  30  88  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all 7 items are allocated. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm or a round-robin allocation based on descending valuations. Let's go through a possible allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent has different valuations for the items.
   - We need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by assigning the highest-value item to each agent one by one.
   - Adjust with remaining items to ensure each agent is satisfied as much as possible.

3. **Step-by-Step Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 60.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 76.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 67, but it's already taken. Next, item 0 at 60.
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 88.

4. **Allocation Update**:
   - Remaining items to allocate: 2, 4, 6.
   - Allocate remaining items to balance the total value and ensure no agent gets zero items.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [1, 2]
   - Agent 1: [3, 4]
   - Agent 2: [0, 6]
   - Agent 3: [5]

6. **Review**:
   - All 7 items are allocated among the agents.
   - Each agent gets at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
