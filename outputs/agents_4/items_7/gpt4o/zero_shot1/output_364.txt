Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  30  52  43  27  94   3
1  83  95  63  73  54  45  58
2   3  32  64  24  30  49  71
3  70  92  92  39  21  23  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. One approach is to assign items to agents based on the highest value each agent places on the remaining items, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest value is for item 5 (value 94)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0

2. Agent 1: 
   - Highest value is for item 1 (value 95)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1

3. Agent 2: 
   - Highest value is for item 6 (value 71)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest value is for item 0 (value 70)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3

Now let's allocate the remaining items:

5. Agent 1:
   - Next highest value is for item 3 (value 73)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1

6. Agent 0:
   - Next highest value is for item 2 (value 52)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0

7. Agent 2:
   - Next highest value is for item 4 (value 30)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while giving priority to higher valuations. The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
