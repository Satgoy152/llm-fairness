Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  47  94   2  22  56  57
1  51  93  17  16  69  42  76
2  20  27  38  86  12  64  67
3  38  60  49  59  62  96  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to do it:

1. Calculate the total value each agent can potentially receive by summing up their valuations for all items.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Summarize valuations
- Agent 0: [41, 47, 94, 2, 22, 56, 57]
- Agent 1: [51, 93, 17, 16, 69, 42, 76]
- Agent 2: [20, 27, 38, 86, 12, 64, 67]
- Agent 3: [38, 60, 49, 59, 62, 96, 85]

### Step 2: Assign items initially to highest valuing agents
- Item 0: Agent 1 (51)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (93)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (94)
- Item 3: Agent 2 (86)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (69)
- Item 5: Agent 3 (96)
- Item 6: Agent 3 (85)

### Step 3: Ensure all agents receive at least one item
Initially, based on the highest valuation:
- Agent 0 has Item [2]
- Agent 1 has Items [0, 1, 4]
- Agent 2 has Item [3]
- Agent 3 has Items [5, 6]

All agents have at least one item, so this allocation is valid.

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and items are allocated based on maximum valuations.
