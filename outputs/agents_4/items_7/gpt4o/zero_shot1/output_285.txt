Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  23   0   0  21   8  88
1  92  41  20   6  68  33  54
2  16  48  43   2  34  18   6
3  96  55  51  39  10  24  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 23  0  0 21  8 88]
 [92 41 20  6 68 33 54]
 [16 48 43  2 34 18  6]
 [96 55 51 39 10 24 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent. We will assign items based on the highest value each agent places on an item that is still available.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 3 values item 0 the most at 96. Assign item 0 to agent 3.
2. Agent 0 values item 6 the most at 88. Assign item 6 to agent 0.
3. Agent 1 values item 0 at 92, but it's already assigned. Their next highest valuation is item 4 at 68. Assign item 4 to agent 1.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 at 55. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 2 values item 2 at 43. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
6. Agent 1 values item 5 at 33. Assign item 5 to agent 1.
7. The only remaining item is item 3. Agent 3 values item 3 the most among the unassigned items. Assign item 3 to agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on the highest value they place on them, while all 7 items are fairly distributed.
