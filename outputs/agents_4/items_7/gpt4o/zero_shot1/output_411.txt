Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  93   7  60  27  71  10
1  55  12  12  46  43  53  81
2  69  11  83  20  72  70  98
3  49  69  59   0  49  57  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 93  7 60 27 71 10]
 [55 12 12 46 43 53 81]
 [69 11 83 20 72 70 98]
 [49 69 59  0 49 57 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  93   7  60  27  71  10
1  55  12  12  46  43  53  81
2  69  11  83  20  72  70  98
3  49  69  59   0  49  57  93
```

We'll consider each agent's highest value items and attempt to allocate them while ensuring a fair distribution.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 1 (93), 5 (71), and 3 (60). We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 6 (81), 0 (55), and 5 (53). We'll allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 6 (98), 2 (83), and 5 (70). Since item 6 is already taken, we'll allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 6 (93), 1 (69), and 5 (57). Since item 6 is already taken, we'll allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Continuing the allocation:

- Agent 0: Already has item 1. Next highest available values are for items 3 (60) and 0 (35). Allocate item 0.
- Agent 1: Already has item 6. Next highest available values are for items 0 (55) and 4 (43). Allocate item 3.
- Agent 2: Already has item 2. Next highest available values are for items 4 (72) and 5 (70). Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3: Already has item 5. Next highest available values are for items 3 (0) and 4 (49). Since item 3 is already taken, Agent 3 will not receive any more items.

After this allocation, all items are assigned, and each agent has items based on their preferences as much as possible.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
