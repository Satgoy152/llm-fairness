Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  88   7  87  81  88  97
1  91  80  57  91  16  54  12
2  86  61  43  73  98  67  92
3  37  76  51  11  17  18  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider the highest value each agent places on an item and proceed with the allocations accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 97 for item 6.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (91) and item 3 (91).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 4 (98) and item 6 (92), but item 6 is already allocated.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 (76) the most.

Based on these evaluations, the allocation could be:

- Assign item 6 to agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate 3 more items.

Continuing with the next highest valuations:

5. Agent 0 highly values item 5 (88).
6. Agent 2 values item 3 (73).
7. Agent 1 values item 2 (57).

Now, we have allocated all 7 items. Here's a proposed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest valuations and assigns all items accordingly. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
