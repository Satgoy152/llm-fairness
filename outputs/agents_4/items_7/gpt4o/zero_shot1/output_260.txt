Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  41   6  96  23   9  41
1  46   6  78  62  13  65  41
2  98  92  45  81  78  40  58
3  49  52  74  38  98  98   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41 41  6 96 23  9 41]
 [46  6 78 62 13 65 41]
 [98 92 45 81 78 40 58]
 [49 52 74 38 98 98  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider how to distribute the items so that each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is reasonably balanced based on the agents' valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [41, 41, 6, 96, 23, 9, 41]
   - Highest value is for item 3 with 96. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [46, 6, 78, 62, 13, 65, 41]
   - Highest value is for item 2 with 78. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [98, 92, 45, 81, 78, 40, 58]
   - Highest value is for item 0 with 98. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [49, 52, 74, 38, 98, 98, 3]
   - Highest value is for item 4 with 98. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we have assigned 4 items, and we need to allocate the remaining 3 items: 1, 5, and 6.

5. **Considering remaining items:**

   - **Item 1:**
     - Agent 2 values it at 92, which is the highest remaining value. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

   - **Item 5:**
     - Agent 3 values it at 98, which is the highest remaining value. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

   - **Item 6:**
     - Agent 1 values it at 41, which is the highest remaining value. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

Now, let's compile the allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 7 items are allocated.
