Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  46  34  96  71  10  95
1   6  82  61  85  97  30  15
2  21  46  32  65  22  75  35
3  83  79  80  50  59  69  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 46 34 96 71 10 95]
 [ 6 82 61 85 97 30 15]
 [21 46 32 65 22 75 35]
 [83 79 80 50 59 69 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items and prioritize giving more items to agents with higher valuations.

2. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

By following this process, we aim to achieve a fair allocation of items.

Here's the allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 4, 1
- Agent 2: Items 5
- Agent 3: Items 0, 2

Now, representing this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
