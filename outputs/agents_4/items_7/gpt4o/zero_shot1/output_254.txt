Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56   3  32  47  42  90   4
1  53   0  33   2  72  67   6
2  70  72  10  67  11  14  85
3  83   2  94  21  51  92  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56  3 32 47 42 90  4]
 [53  0 33  2 72 67  6]
 [70 72 10 67 11 14 85]
 [83  2 94 21 51 92 95]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value of all items. This can be achieved by maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

Let's first calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 56 + 3 + 32 + 47 + 42 + 90 + 4 = 274
- Agent 1: 53 + 0 + 33 + 2 + 72 + 67 + 6 = 233
- Agent 2: 70 + 72 + 10 + 67 + 11 + 14 + 85 = 329
- Agent 3: 83 + 2 + 94 + 21 + 51 + 92 + 95 = 438

Now, let's try to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized while each item is only allocated once:

1. Agent 3 highly values items 2, 5, and 6. Allocating these items to agent 3 would maximize their total valuation.
2. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0 and item 5. Since item 5 is already allocated to agent 3, we assign item 0 to agent 0.
3. Agent 1 values item 4 highly, so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.
4. Agent 2 values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
5. The remaining item, item 3, needs to be allocated. Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 3 compared to other agents, so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the given valuations, and each agent's total valuation is maximized.
