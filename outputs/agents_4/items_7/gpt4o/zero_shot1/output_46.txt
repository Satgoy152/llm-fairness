Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  72  49  32  37  61  81
1  68  40  58  13  84  53  71
2  17  95  34  38  57  26  70
3  83  39   6  87  73  59  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One potential approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction or total value each agent receives from the items they get. A common strategy for this is to use a greedy algorithm or some kind of optimization to distribute items based on individual agent preferences.

Let's proceed by attempting to maximize the total valuations each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for items 0, 1, and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations are for items 4, 0, and 6.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations are for items 1, 6, and 4.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuations are for items 3, 0, and 4.

Let's attempt to allocate the items in a way that each agent receives one of their top-valued items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values this the most, so allocate it to Agent 3.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values this the highest, so allocate it to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: This item is not highly valued by any agent, but Agent 0 has the highest relative valuation, so allocate it to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation, so allocate it to Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this the highest, so allocate it to Agent 1.
- **Item 5**: This item is most valued by Agent 0, so allocate it to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values this item highly, but Agent 1 also values it significantly. Allocate it to Agent 1 to balance their allocation.

After this allocation, every agent should have at least one item, and the assignments should maximize each agent's valuation based on their preferences.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed fairly, considering the preferences of each agent.
