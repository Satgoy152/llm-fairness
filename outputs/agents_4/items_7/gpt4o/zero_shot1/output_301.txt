Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  68  27  67  15  11  82
1  23  22  52   7   5  70  86
2  80  91  38  55  23  27  51
3  27   8  80   3  12  23  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items, which can help us in making a fair allocation.

- Agent 0: 56 + 68 + 27 + 67 + 15 + 11 + 82 = 326
- Agent 1: 23 + 22 + 52 + 7 + 5 + 70 + 86 = 265
- Agent 2: 80 + 91 + 38 + 55 + 23 + 27 + 51 = 365
- Agent 3: 27 + 8 + 80 + 3 + 12 + 23 + 73 = 226

Next, we can attempt to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Allocate items to maximize agent's total value:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 highly (82).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 highly (86).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 highly (91).
   - Agent 3 values item 2 highly (80).

2. Distribute remaining items to ensure fairness and integer allocation:
   - Assign items that are not highly valued by other agents to balance the item count.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [5, 6]
- Agent 2: [1, 3]
- Agent 3: [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize their total perceived value.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items fairly among the 4 agents.
