Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  60  58   5  17  90  77
1   5  48  83  74  14  49  87
2  58  36  17  88  12  15  69
3   7  62  52  80  16  64  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[54 60 58  5 17 90 77]
 [ 5 48 83 74 14 49 87]
 [58 36 17 88 12 15 69]
 [ 7 62 52 80 16 64 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuations and try to ensure each agent gets items that maximize their value while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0: 
- High values: 90 (Item 5), 77 (Item 6), 60 (Item 1)

Agent 1:
- High values: 87 (Item 6), 83 (Item 2), 74 (Item 3)

Agent 2:
- High values: 88 (Item 3), 69 (Item 6), 58 (Item 0)

Agent 3:
- High values: 80 (Item 3), 64 (Item 5), 62 (Item 1)

Now, let's try to allocate items to maximize satisfaction:

1. Assign Item 5 (value 90) to Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 6 (value 87) to Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 3 (value 88) to Agent 2.
4. Assign Item 1 (value 62) to Agent 3.

Now we have 3 items left: 0, 2, 4.

5. Assign Item 0 (value 54) to Agent 0.
6. Assign Item 2 (value 83) to Agent 1.
7. Assign Item 4 (value 16) to Agent 3.

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, maximizing their valuations given the constraints. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
