Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  93  80  90  11  48   4
1  88  99   3   8  58  60  36
2  58  73   8  15  89  97  89
3  50  39  22  26  28  59  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations**: Start by identifying which agent values each item the most, as this could maximize fairness and satisfaction.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuations**: Assign each item to the agent who has the highest valuation for that item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Adjust Allocations for Fairness**: If any agent ends up with no items, adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 1 (88)
- **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 1 (99)
- **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 0 (80)
- **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 0 (90)
- **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 2 (89)
- **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 2 (97)
- **Item 6**: Highest value by Agent 3 (87)

Initially, the allocation would look like this:
- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [4, 5]
- Agent 3: [6]

This allocation is already fair as each agent receives at least one item, and each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Therefore, the final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This ensures that all items are fairly distributed according to the highest valuations, and each agent receives at least one item.
