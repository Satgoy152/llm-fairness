Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  84  83  99  93  19  50
1  62  52  55  62  73   2  45
2  80  33  31  22  81  28  74
3  49  42  37  98  12  91  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 42 37 98 12 91 93]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. The goal is to distribute the items so that the valuations are as balanced as possible.

Let's start by considering the highest value each agent has for the items, and then proceed to allocate the items based on maximizing the total value:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest values for items 3 (99) and 4 (93).
2. **Agent 1** has a preference for item 4 (73).
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 (80) the most.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 3 (98) and 5 (91).

Considering these preferences, we will allocate items to balance the total value:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 1, as these are among the highest values for Agent 0, and other agents highly value items 3 and 4.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 6.
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 3, 4, and 5 (since Agent 3 has high values for these items).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the total value is maximized while each item is allocated to only one agent.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
