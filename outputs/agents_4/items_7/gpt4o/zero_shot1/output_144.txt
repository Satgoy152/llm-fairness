Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  86  15  33  36  11  44
1  51  43  83  24  58  52  56
2  33  88  61  57  78  26  65
3  23  67  70  86   3  25  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that the overall value perceived by each agent is balanced, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

One approach to achieve fairness is to iterate through the items and allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while also considering the need to balance the total number of items each agent receives.

Based on the valuations provided, here's a possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 51, so assign it to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 88, so assign it to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 83, so assign it to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 86, so assign it to Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 78, so assign it to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 52, which is the highest, so assign it to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most at 65, so assign it to Agent 2.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4, 6],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, except for Agent 0 who, based on their valuations, does not receive any items with higher preferences than the others. The distribution considers both the highest valuations and the need to distribute the items fairly based on the given constraints.
