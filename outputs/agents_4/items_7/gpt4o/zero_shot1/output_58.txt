Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  80  79  59  79  74  23
1  62  92  98   2  68  12  38
2  23  95  28  73  70  22  60
3  70  37  96  87  53  90  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. First, assign each agent at least one item based on their highest valuation.
2. Then, allocate the remaining items to maximize the total value.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value 86).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (value 98).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the most (value 95).
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most (value 90).

Now, we have allocated four items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We need to allocate three more items. To maximize total value, we will allocate based on the next highest available valuations:

5. Agent 3 values item 3 the next most (value 87).
6. Agent 0 values item 4 the next most (value 79).
7. Agent 2 values item 6 the next most (value 60).

After these allocations, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```
