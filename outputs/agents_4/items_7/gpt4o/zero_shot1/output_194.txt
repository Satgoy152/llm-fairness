Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78   6  12  83  79  44  76
1  22  52   2  42  33  77  45
2  16  94  76  56  93  85  43
3  39  60  11  35  72  56  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider either maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents or ensuring that each agent receives at least some items according to their preferences. Let's aim for a balanced approach where each agent receives at least one item, if possible, while trying to maximize the total valuation. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (83).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5 (77).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (94).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4 (72).

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We have 3 more items to allocate. Let's distribute these considering the next highest valuations:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Also allocate item 0 (78) to agent 0 as it has a high valuation for it.

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Also allocate item 2 (76) to agent 2 as it has a high valuation for it.

7. **Agent 3**:
   - Also allocate item 6 (71) to agent 3 as it has a high valuation for it.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocations are done to maximize the satisfaction based on the given valuations.
