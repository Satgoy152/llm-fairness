Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  82  29  69  82  30  70
1  48   4  10  35  65  71  95
2  67  63  82  41  44  79  84
3  77  39  65  63  12   7   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 82 29 69 82 30 70]
 [48  4 10 35 65 71 95]
 [67 63 82 41 44 79 84]
 [77 39 65 63 12  7  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 4 (82 each). Assigning these items to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.
2. Agent 1 has a very high valuation for item 6 (95). Assigning item 6 to Agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 (82) and 5 (79). Assigning these items to Agent 2 maximizes their satisfaction.
4. Agent 3 has relatively high valuations for items 0 (77) and 3 (63). Assigning these items to Agent 3 ensures that they receive items they value significantly.

Based on this strategy, here is the allocation of items to agents:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value highly, and all 7 items are allocated among the agents.
