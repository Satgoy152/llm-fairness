Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  80  60  98  78  51  76
1  72  82  88  77   7  45  93
2   5  45  37  28  45   7   3
3  25  21   6  92  52  68  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:** 
   - For each item, identify the agent who values it the most.
  
2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Ensure a Fair Distribution:**
   - Make sure that if any agent doesn't receive any items, the distribution is reconsidered to ensure fairness. 
   - Reallocate if necessary to ensure each agent gets at least one item or has the opportunity to get items based on high valuations.

Let's apply this process to the given table:

- **Item 0:** Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (72)
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (82)
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (88)
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (98)
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (78)
- **Item 5:** Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (68)
- **Item 6:** Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (93)

Now let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Items 3 and 4
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 1, 2, 6
- **Agent 3:** Item 5

Agent 2 has no items, so we will reconsider to ensure all agents are included. Let's make an adjustment:

- **Agent 0:** Items 3 and 4
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 1, 2
- **Agent 2:** Item 6
- **Agent 3:** Item 5

This ensures all items are allocated and each agent has the opportunity to receive at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
