Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  54  87  10   7  62  42
1  49  10  14  25  85   2  12
2  18   1   3  35  87  92  31
3  35  17  70  30  26  94   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the total value as evenly as possible while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One way to approach this is by assigning items based on maximizing each agent's utility for the items they receive, while keeping the distribution balanced.

Let's consider the values for each agent:

- Agent 0: 79, 54, 87, 10, 7, 62, 42
- Agent 1: 49, 10, 14, 25, 85, 2, 12
- Agent 2: 18, 1, 3, 35, 87, 92, 31
- Agent 3: 35, 17, 70, 30, 26, 94, 1

We will assign the items to the agents to maximize their utility, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and a total of 7 items are distributed.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High values: item 2 (87), item 0 (79)
   - Assign items: 0, 2

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High values: item 4 (85)
   - Assign items: 4

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High values: item 5 (92), item 4 (87)
   - Assign items: 5

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High values: item 5 (94), item 2 (70)
   - Assign items: 1, 3, 6

By ensuring a balance in the distribution, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and a total of 7 items are allocated according to their valuations.
