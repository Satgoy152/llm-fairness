Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  89  71  81  29  51  88
1   8  24  57  44  16  78  41
2  29  94  88   7  64  26  19
3   3  45  50  72  39  33  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can apply a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. Create a list of all items with their respective values for each agent.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on the value.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring that no item is assigned more than once.

Using this approach, the allocation is as follows:

- Item 1: Highest value is 94 by agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest value is 78 by agent 1.
- Item 6: Highest value is 88 by agent 0.
- Item 0: Highest value is 59 by agent 0.
- Item 2: Highest value is 88 by agent 2.
- Item 3: Highest value is 81 by agent 0.
- Item 4: Highest value is 64 by agent 2.

Now, let's distribute the items to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 3, and 6.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 3 gets no items.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2, 4],
    "3": []
}
```
