Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95   1  89  50  32  48  57
1  96  49  47  68  30  77  49
2  26  16   5  95  57  19  71
3  51  46  28  86   7  68  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95  1 89 50 32 48 57]
 [96 49 47 68 30 77 49]
 [26 16  5 95 57 19 71]
 [51 46 28 86  7 68 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a method that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s how we can approach the problem:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 95
   - Agent 1 values it at 96
   - Agent 2 values it at 26
   - Agent 3 values it at 51
   - Allocate to Agent 1

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 1
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Agent 2 values it at 16
   - Agent 3 values it at 46
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 89
   - Agent 1 values it at 47
   - Agent 2 values it at 5
   - Agent 3 values it at 28
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 50
   - Agent 1 values it at 68
   - Agent 2 values it at 95
   - Agent 3 values it at 86
   - Allocate to Agent 2

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 32
   - Agent 1 values it at 30
   - Agent 2 values it at 57
   - Agent 3 values it at 7
   - Allocate to Agent 2

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 48
   - Agent 1 values it at 77
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - Agent 3 values it at 68
   - Allocate to Agent 1

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 57
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Agent 2 values it at 71
   - Agent 3 values it at 98
   - Allocate to Agent 3

Now, each agent has been allocated items based on their highest valuation per item.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6]
}
```
This allocation ensures each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while distributing all 7 items among the agents.
