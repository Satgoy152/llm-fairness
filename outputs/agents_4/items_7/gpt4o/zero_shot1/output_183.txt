Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  81  25  10  79  75  44
1  66  57  22   4  28  39  12
2  36  33  26  22  85  93  39
3  47  50  48  51  43  80  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 81 25 10 79 75 44]
 [66 57 22  4 28 39 12]
 [36 33 26 22 85 93 39]
 [47 50 48 51 43 80 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 1, 4, and 0. Allocating item 1 and item 4 would give a total valuation of 81 + 79 = 160.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 0 and 1. Since item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0, allocate item 0 to Agent 1 for a valuation of 66.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 5 and 4. Since item 4 is already allocated, allocate item 5 for a value of 93.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 5 and 3. Since item 5 is allocated, allocate item 3 for a value of 51.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items. Let's use the items that haven't been allocated yet:

- Items left are: 2 and 6

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 3, as they have a valuation of 48, which is the highest remaining valuation for item 2.

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0, as they have a valuation of 44, which is the highest remaining valuation for item 6.

Finally, the allocations can be presented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to only one agent and tries to maximize the valuations based on the given preferences.
