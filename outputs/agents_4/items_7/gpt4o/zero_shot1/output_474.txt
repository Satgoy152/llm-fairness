Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  52  70  79  54   5  66
1  88   6  24  96  11  85  18
2  82  44  59   4  57  28  28
3  13  72  87  63  92  85  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common method for achieving a fair allocation is to use a "greedy" approach, where we assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item until all items are allocated. Here's how we can do it:

1. Start with an empty allocation for each agent.
2. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
3. Assign the item to that agent.
4. Ensure that a total of 7 items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (88)
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most (72)
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most (87)
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (96)
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (92)
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (85)
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (66)

The final allocation based on these valuations is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
