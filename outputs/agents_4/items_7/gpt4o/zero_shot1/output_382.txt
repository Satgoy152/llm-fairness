Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  30  52  39  99  48  64
1  27  72  42  95  86   2  64
2  67  56  84  82  33  68  34
3  84  28  25   0  61  90  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 30 52 39 99 48 64]
 [27 72 42 95 86  2 64]
 [67 56 84 82 33 68 34]
 [84 28 25  0 61 90 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a greedy method where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. We proceed as follows:

1. List each item and find out which agent values that item the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each item is only assigned once and check that each agent receives at least one item or their fair share.

Here is the allocation based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Highest value is 84 by Agent 3
- Item 1: Highest value is 72 by Agent 1
- Item 2: Highest value is 84 by Agent 2
- Item 3: Highest value is 95 by Agent 1
- Item 4: Highest value is 99 by Agent 0
- Item 5: Highest value is 90 by Agent 3
- Item 6: Highest value is 64 by Agents 0 and 1 (tie, choose one based on balance or preference)

Based on this, the allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items 4
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, 6
- Agent 2 receives item 2
- Agent 3 receives items 0, 5

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
