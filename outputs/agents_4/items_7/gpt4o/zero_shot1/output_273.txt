Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  31  17  32   2  21  74
1  29  27  11   2  73  65  23
2  57  36  87  28  92  91  77
3  60  92  46  63  99  29  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One possible approach is to consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to assign them in a way that maximizes the total valuation.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, provided the item is not already allocated. 
2. If two agents have the highest valuation for the same item, consider the next highest available item for one of the agents.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 74.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 73.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 92, but it's already taken, so we move to the next highest, which is item 5 at 91.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 99, but it's already taken, so we move to the next highest, which is item 1 at 92.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 already has item 6, let's assign them another high-value item like item 0 (69).
- Agent 1 has item 4, so we assign them another high-value item like item 5 (65), but it's already taken, so we move to item 0 (29), which is available.
- Agent 2 has item 5, let's assign them item 2 (87).
- Agent 3 has item 1, let's assign them item 3 (63).

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

Note: The allocation aims to maximize the agent's valuations while distributing all items fairly.
