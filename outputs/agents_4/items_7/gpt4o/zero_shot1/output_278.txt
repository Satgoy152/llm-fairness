Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  75  54  73  35   9  88
1  81  33  67  74  27  46  27
2  38  69  26  35  23  27  85
3  21  36  27  79  56  15   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**: First, determine which agent values each item the most. Assign the item to that agent to maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Maximize overall satisfaction**: Check if the initial assignments lead to a fair distribution. If not, attempt to reallocate items to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences.

3. **Reallocate if necessary**: If any agent ends up with no items or very low total value, consider swapping items to improve fairness while keeping overall satisfaction high.

Let's apply this:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most (92).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (75).
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most (67).
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most (79).
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most (56).
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (46).
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most (85).

After initial allocation based on highest value:
- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [3, 4]

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and assigns all items. Each agent receives items that they value highly, leading to a fair distribution based on preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
