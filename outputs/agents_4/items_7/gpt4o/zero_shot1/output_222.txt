Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  68  63  78   0  64  74
1   1  66  13  29  34  77  47
2   0  26  45   1  48   0  36
3  69   5  86  81  83   4  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items to prioritize agents with higher total valuations.
2. Assign items to agents based on the highest individual valuations until all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 77 + 68 + 63 + 78 + 0 + 64 + 74 = 424
- Agent 1: 1 + 66 + 13 + 29 + 34 + 77 + 47 = 267
- Agent 2: 0 + 26 + 45 + 1 + 48 + 0 + 36 = 156
- Agent 3: 69 + 5 + 86 + 81 + 83 + 4 + 88 = 416

Agent 0 and Agent 3 have the highest total valuations, so we'll prioritize allocating high-value items to them first. 

Next, we allocate items based on each agent's highest individual valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items: 3 (78), 0 (77), 6 (74)
2. Agent 3 has high valuations for items: 6 (88), 4 (83), 2 (86)
3. Agent 1 has high valuations for item: 5 (77)
4. Agent 2 has high valuations for item: 4 (48)

Considering these valuations, we can allocate as follows to maximize fairness:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 6, 1]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 6, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution while respecting the integer item allocation requirement.
