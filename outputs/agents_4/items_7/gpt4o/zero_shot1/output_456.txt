Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  88  84  50  36  61  99
1  74  64  79  12  92   3  18
2  96  35  11  95  15  47  46
3  69  36  97  43  76  90  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 88 84 50 36 61 99]
 [74 64 79 12 92  3 18]
 [96 35 11 95 15 47 46]
 [69 36 97 43 76 90 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. Here's an approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: Each agent should get at least one item they value highly if possible.
2. **Distribute items to balance total value among agents**: Aim to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  88  84  50  36  61  99
1  74  64  79  12  92   3  18
2  96  35  11  95  15  47  46
3  69  36  97  43  76  90  50
```

### Step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0**: They value item 6 the most at 99. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: They value item 4 the most at 92. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: They value item 0 the most at 96. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: They value item 2 the most at 97. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and we need to allocate the remaining 3 items (1, 3, and 5) to maximize fairness.

- **Remaining items**: 1, 3, 5
- **Agent 0**: Already has item 6, which they value at 99.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 4, which they value at 92.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 0, which they value at 96.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 2, which they value at 97.

Allocate remaining items based on next highest valuations and balance:

1. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 at 88. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 at 95. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 at 90. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, and the total number of items allocated sums to 7.
