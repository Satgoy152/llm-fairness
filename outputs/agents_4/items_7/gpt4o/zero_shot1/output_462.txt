Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  44  66  98  13  55  23
1  30  45  71  32  52  33   4
2  48  48  41  55  82  31  65
3  81  64  96  55  88  45  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 64 96 55 88 45 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (since there are 4 agents and 7 items, at least one agent will need to receive more than one item).

Let's analyze the matrix and allocate items to maximize the total valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 3 (98).
- Agent 1 has relatively high values for items 2 (71) and 4 (52).
- Agent 2 has high values for item 4 (82) and item 6 (65).
- Agent 3 has high values for item 2 (96) and item 4 (88).

Based on these observations, we can make the following allocations to maximize the valuations:

1. Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (highest value for item 3).
2. Allocate item 2 to agent 3 (highest value for item 2).
3. Allocate item 4 to agent 2 (highest value for item 4).
4. Allocate item 6 to agent 2 (second-highest value for item 6).
5. Allocate item 1 to agent 3 (second-highest value for item 1).
6. Allocate item 0 to agent 0 (second-highest value for item 0).
7. Allocate item 5 to agent 1 (highest remaining valuation).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while maximizing their individual valuations, subject to the constraint that each agent can receive only integer numbers of items.
