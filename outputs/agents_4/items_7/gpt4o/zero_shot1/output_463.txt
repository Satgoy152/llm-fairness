Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  37  76  93  58  21  90
1  89  67  43  29  20  98  64
2  60  42  74  69   2  34  53
3  68  51  17  73  24   9   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers both maximizing the overall value and ensuring each agent ends up with a reasonable allocation. One approach is to prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most, while also ensuring every item is allocated.

Let's analyze the table and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the highest (93).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the highest (98).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the highest (74).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the highest (68).

Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 4, 6):

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 1 values it the second highest (67).
  - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
  
- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values it the second highest (58).
  - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
  
- **Item 6**: 
  - Agent 0 values it the third highest (90).
  - Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

Ensuring each item is allocated, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and tries to respect the preferences as much as possible.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
