Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  37  77  24  86  49  82
1  47  63  74  68  90  38  42
2  93  99  59  21  79  91  25
3  58  30  31  52  45   1  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are distributed, we can aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent based on their preferences. Let's analyze the table and find a suitable allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (86).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (90), but since we've already allocated item 4 to Agent 0, we look for the next highest value for Agent 1, which is item 2 (74).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (99).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (58).

This gives us the following initial allocations:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [0]

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (3, 5, 6) to the agents:

- Agent 0's next highest value is item 6 (82).
- Agent 1's next highest available value is item 3 (68).
- Agent 2's next highest available value is item 5 (91).
- Agent 3's next highest available value is item 3 (52), but since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, we skip it.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [4, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 3]
- Agent 2: [1, 5]
- Agent 3: [0]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
