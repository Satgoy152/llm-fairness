Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  33  39  30  33  30  34
1  88  95  14  17  27  38  78
2  93   9   5  33  40  42  16
3  34  69  17  56  76  40  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and attempt to maximize the satisfaction of each agent. The aim is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable total value based on their preferences, while also ensuring that each gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences**: Review the table to identify which agent values each item the most.
2. **Initial Allocation Based on Preferences**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and no agent is significantly disadvantaged.

Let's evaluate the valuations and attempt a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0** has high values for items: 0 (83), 2 (39).
- **Agent 1** values item 1 (95) highly.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 (40) and item 5 (42) reasonably.
- **Agent 3** values item 6 (94) and item 3 (56) highly.

Based on this, a potential allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, item 1 to Agent 1, item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, item 6 to Agent 3.

Each agent thus receives a reasonable distribution of items based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly while making sure all agents receive items.
