Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  87  23  19  86  78   1
1  33  39  65  67  81   6   0
2   7  34  71  50  85  84  37
3  48  97  69  66  44  53  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while taking into account their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. One common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Look at the valuation of each item for all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 63, agent 1 at 33, agent 2 at 7, and agent 3 at 48. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 87, agent 1 at 39, agent 2 at 34, and agent 3 at 97. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 23, agent 1 at 65, agent 2 at 71, and agent 3 at 69. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 19, agent 1 at 67, agent 2 at 50, and agent 3 at 66. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 86, agent 1 at 81, agent 2 at 85, and agent 3 at 44. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 78, agent 1 at 6, agent 2 at 84, and agent 3 at 53. Assign item 5 to agent 2.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 1, agent 1 at 0, agent 2 at 37, and agent 3 at 33. Assign item 6 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed based on the highest valuation by each agent, and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5, 6],
    "3": [1]
}
```
