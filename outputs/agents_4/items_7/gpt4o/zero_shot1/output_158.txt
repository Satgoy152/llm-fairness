Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  12  18   2  80  77  30
1  12  61   1  95  37  25  62
2  81  66  68   2  91  69  67
3   9  69  12  28  91  45  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent**: We'll start by finding out which items each agent values the most.

2. **Allocate items based on highest value**: Allocate the items to agents starting with the highest value for each agent and moving downwards, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure all items are assigned.

4. **Check for fairness and balance**: Make sure the distribution of items is fair and balanced, considering the total number of items and agents.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest (value 80), followed by item 5 (value 77), and item 0 (value 69).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the highest (value 95), followed by item 6 (value 62), and item 1 (value 61).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest (value 91), followed by item 0 (value 81), and item 5 (value 69).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 4 the highest (value 91), followed by item 1 (value 69), and item 5 (value 45).

Considering the above valuations, we make the following allocations:

- **Item 4**: Allocated to Agent 2 (highest value of 91).
- **Item 5**: Allocated to Agent 0 (next highest value of 77 after item 4 is taken).
- **Item 0**: Allocated to Agent 2 (next highest value of 81 after item 4 is taken).
- **Item 3**: Allocated to Agent 1 (highest value of 95).
- **Item 6**: Allocated to Agent 1 (next highest value of 62 after item 3 is taken).
- **Item 1**: Allocated to Agent 3 (highest remaining value of 69).
- **Item 2**: Allocated to Agent 0 (next highest value of 18).

Now, we present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [1]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent receives items fairly based on their valuations, with all 7 items distributed.
