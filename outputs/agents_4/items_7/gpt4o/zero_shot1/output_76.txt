Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  77   2  58  80  18  13
1  20  91  37  51  79   7   5
2  57  66  27  37  58  22  35
3  96  57  73  76  14  52   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 57 73 76 14 52  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value or ensure each agent has approximately equal total value from their allocated items. Let's follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**: 
   - For item 0, agent 3 values it the most (96).
   - For item 1, agent 1 values it the most (91).
   - For item 2, agent 3 values it the most (73).
   - For item 3, agent 3 values it the most (76).
   - For item 4, agent 0 values it the most (80).
   - For item 5, agent 3 values it the most (52).
   - For item 6, agent 2 values it the most (35).

2. **Allocate based on highest value**:
   - Assign item 0 to agent 3.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 3.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 3.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 3.
   - Assign item 6 to agent 2.

3. **Check allocation fairness**: 
   - Agent 0: [4]
   - Agent 1: [1]
   - Agent 2: [6]
   - Agent 3: [0, 2, 3, 5]

4. **Adjust allocation for more fairness**:
   - Agent 3 has too many items. We need to redistribute to ensure each agent gets at least one item where possible.
   - Reassign item 3 to agent 2 since agent 2 values it second highest (37), which is better than nothing.

5. **Final allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [4]
   - Agent 1: [1]
   - Agent 2: [3, 6]
   - Agent 3: [0, 2, 5]

Now, let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
