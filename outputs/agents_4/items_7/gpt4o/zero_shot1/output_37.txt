Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  26  15  22  18  22  74
1  38  48  91  55  64  61   0
2  42   0  51  52  35  87  82
3  30   8  96  40  35  61  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated. We'll aim to distribute the items such that the allocation is balanced and considers the valuations of each agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - 0: 89
  - 1: 26
  - 2: 15
  - 3: 22
  - 4: 18
  - 5: 22
  - 6: 74

- Agent 1 values items:
  - 0: 38
  - 1: 48
  - 2: 91
  - 3: 55
  - 4: 64
  - 5: 61
  - 6: 0

- Agent 2 values items:
  - 0: 42
  - 1: 0
  - 2: 51
  - 3: 52
  - 4: 35
  - 5: 87
  - 6: 82

- Agent 3 values items:
  - 0: 30
  - 1: 8
  - 2: 96
  - 3: 40
  - 4: 35
  - 5: 61
  - 6: 41

A possible fair allocation is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated exactly once. 

Let's ensure a balanced distribution and consider each agent's top preferences:

1. Agent 0: Highest values are items 0 (89) and 6 (74).
2. Agent 1: Highest value is item 2 (91).
3. Agent 2: Highest values are items 5 (87) and 6 (82).
4. Agent 3: Highest value is item 2 (96).

Assign items based on the highest valuations and ensuring a balanced distribution:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3, as they value it highest.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, given their next highest value and to distribute items evenly.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, given their next highest value.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3, to balance the allocations.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns each agent an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated fairly based on their valuations.
