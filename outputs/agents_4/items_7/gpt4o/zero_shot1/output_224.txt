Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  29  99  65   4  36  80
1  46  59  96  79  65  30  90
2  93  14  78  10  25   8  18
3  16  91  64  32  75  80  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 59 96 79 65 30 90]
 [93 14 78 10 25  8 18]
 [16 91 64 32 75 80 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 93.
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 91.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 79.
   - Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most at 75.
   - Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most at 80.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 90.

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Total Valuation:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 3.
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.
