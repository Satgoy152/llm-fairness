Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  86  61  21  60  26  80
1  68  49  34  44   6  96   0
2  15   2   6  41   5  76  48
3  21  60  36   4  92   0  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0: This agent highly values items 0, 1, and 6. We can allocate items 0 and 6 to this agent to give them high total value.

2. Agent 1: This agent highly values items 5 and 3. We can allocate items 5 to this agent because it has the highest value for them.

3. Agent 2: This agent highly values item 5, but since it's already allocated to Agent 1, we can allocate items 3 and 6 to this agent.

4. Agent 3: This agent highly values item 4, so we can allocate item 4 to this agent.

In summary, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 3, 2
- Agent 3: Item 4, 1

Now, let's format these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.
