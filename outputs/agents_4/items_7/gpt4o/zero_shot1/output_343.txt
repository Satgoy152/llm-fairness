Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  58  93  19  55  39  50
1  32   0  43  40  81  41  28
2  49  59  10  77  14  25  23
3  23  42  26  54  31  64  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 1. They value item 2 the highest, followed by item 0. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

After assigning the highest valued items to each agent, we will assign the remaining items in a way that maintains balance:

5. **Assign remaining items:**
   - Items left are 0, 1, and 5.
   - Agent 0 can take item 0 as it is the next highest valued item for them.
   - Agent 3 can take item 5, as they have the second-highest valuation for it.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it balances the distribution and maximizes their total valuation.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
