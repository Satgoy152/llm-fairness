Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  57  36  18  25  32  11
1  47  26  65  82  42  12  86
2  22  58  15  13   2  64  90
3  31  68  42  10  79  15  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and attempt to distribute them in a manner that maximizes overall happiness while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Here is one way to approach it:

1. **Identify Preferences**: Look at the highest values each agent has for the items. This will help in deciding which item should be allocated to which agent to maximize overall satisfaction.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by giving each item to the agent who values it the most. If two agents value an item equally, you might need an additional criterion (e.g., the next highest valued item, random selection, etc.).

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that the allocation is fair in terms of total value received.

Following this method, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest valuations: Item 0 (55), Item 1 (57)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest valuations: Item 3 (82), Item 6 (86)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest valuations: Item 5 (64), Item 6 (90)

- **Agent 3**:
  - Highest valuations: Item 1 (68), Item 4 (79)

Let's allocate based on the highest valuations per item, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 (55)
- **Item 1**: Agent 3 (68)
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 (65)
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 (82)
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 (79)
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 (64)
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 (90)

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it highly, and each agent ends up with a fair distribution based on their valuation preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects the given conditions and ensures that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.
