Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  33  29  22  33  35   3
1  96  80  83  86  47  36  38
2  75  42  69  74  73  24  71
3  90  99  50  83  87  40  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by matching agents with items they value highly, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 5 (35), 1 (33), 4 (33)
- Agent 1 values items: 0 (96), 3 (86), 2 (83)
- Agent 2 values items: 0 (75), 3 (74), 6 (71)
- Agent 3 values items: 1 (99), 4 (87), 3 (83)

A possible allocation strategy is to assign the highest-valued items to each agent, ensuring that each item is only assigned once and trying to give each agent at least one item. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 2, 3, and 4.

- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (next highest value).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (next highest value for Agent 3).

The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
