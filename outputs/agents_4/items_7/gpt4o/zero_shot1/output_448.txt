Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  38  29  31   9  82  41
1  90  38  68  92  17  21  16
2  24  31   8  11  28  64  33
3  95  83  74  48  50  14  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One way to approach this is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign items to agents based on the highest valuations that have not yet been assigned. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 3** values item 0 at 95, which is the highest valuation for any single item by any agent. Assign item 0 to agent 3.
2. **Agent 3** also has the highest valuation for item 1 at 83. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
3. **Agent 1** values item 3 at 92, the next highest unassigned valuation. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 at 84, the next highest unassigned valuation. Assign item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 0** values item 5 at 82, the next highest unassigned valuation. Assign item 5 to agent 0.
6. **Agent 3** values item 2 at 74, the next highest unassigned valuation. Assign item 2 to agent 3.
7. **Agent 2** values item 4 at 28, the next highest unassigned valuation. Assign item 4 to agent 2.

Now, ensure every agent is represented in the allocation, even if they receive no items:

- Agent 0 receives item 5.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.
- Agent 3 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 6.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```
