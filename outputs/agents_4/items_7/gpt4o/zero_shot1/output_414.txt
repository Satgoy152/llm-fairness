Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  19  71  33  63  14   8
1  36  75  74  62  35  41  62
2  55   5  56  25  26  59  33
3  40   7  83  66  28  25  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent considering their preferences. We must ensure that each agent receives a reasonable allocation based on the values they assign to the items.

Let's analyze the table of valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Values: 77, 19, 71, 33, 63, 14, 8  
   - Highest values: 77 (item 0), 71 (item 2), 63 (item 4)

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Values: 36, 75, 74, 62, 35, 41, 62  
   - Highest values: 75 (item 1), 74 (item 2), 62 (item 3)

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Values: 55, 5, 56, 25, 26, 59, 33  
   - Highest values: 59 (item 5), 56 (item 2), 55 (item 0)

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Values: 40, 7, 83, 66, 28, 25, 34  
   - Highest values: 83 (item 2), 66 (item 3), 40 (item 0)

Considering these preferences, we aim to distribute the items so that the sum of the values for each agent is maximized, without exceeding the total available items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**:  
  - Allocated items: [0] (value: 77)

- **Agent 1**:  
  - Allocated items: [1, 3] (values: 75, 62)

- **Agent 2**:  
  - Allocated items: [5] (value: 59)

- **Agent 3**:  
  - Allocated items: [2, 4, 6] (values: 83, 28, 34)

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed while maximizing the individual values for each agent based on their preferences.

Here's how the allocations look in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
