Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  73  37  74  90  98  87
1   0  99  68  54  21  47  86
2  53  88  78   6  64   3  95
3  21  35  80  76  27  38  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 35 80 76 27 38 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share considering their valuations. We will attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent ends up with at least one item, if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highly overall, particularly item 5.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 and item 2.
- Agent 2 highly values item 6 and item 1.
- Agent 3 highly values item 2 and item 3.

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 5 (98). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 1 (99). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 6 (95). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 2 (80). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. Let's allocate the remaining 3 items to balance the allocation while considering high valuations:

5. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (61) to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (54) to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (64) to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their highest valuations for the remaining items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
