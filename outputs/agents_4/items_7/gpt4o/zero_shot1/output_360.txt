Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  31  53  59  40  75  58
1  80  29  28  38   2  74  40
2  21  89  35  88  14  53  74
3  20  50  84  20  99  29   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to find a way to distribute the items so that the combined valuations are as balanced as possible. We can start by considering the highest value each agent has for the items and proceed by assigning items to agents to maximize their total value while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (77)
   - Next highest: Item 5 (75)
   - Allocation: [0, 5]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (80), but already allocated to agent 0.
   - Next highest: Item 5 (74), but already allocated to agent 0.
   - Next highest: Item 3 (38)
   - Allocation: [3]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 1 (89)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (88), but already allocated to agent 1.
   - Next highest: Item 6 (74)
   - Allocation: [1, 6]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (99)
   - Allocation: [4]

Now, let's verify:
- Total items allocated: 2 (Agent 0) + 1 (Agent 1) + 2 (Agent 2) + 1 (Agent 3) = 6
- There seems to be one item missing. Let's allocate it to the agent with the least total value or highest preference.

Re-evaluate:
- Agent 3 has only one item and is left with a total of 99. Assign the least valued unallocated item:
   - Item 2 (84 for Agent 3)
   - Allocation update for Agent 3: [4, 2]

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```
