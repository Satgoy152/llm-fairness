Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  76  31  65  64  78  45
1  30  43  51   5  34  24  76
2  63  19  99  82  10  62  27
3  71  65  98  74   3  55  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: First, calculate the total valuation each agent would have if they received all items.
   - Agent 0: 96 + 76 + 31 + 65 + 64 + 78 + 45 = 455
   - Agent 1: 30 + 43 + 51 + 5 + 34 + 24 + 76 = 263
   - Agent 2: 63 + 19 + 99 + 82 + 10 + 62 + 27 = 362
   - Agent 3: 71 + 65 + 98 + 74 + 3 + 55 + 56 = 422

2. **Allocate Items**: Assign items to agents to balance the total value as closely as possible. One possible allocation could be:

   - Agent 0 receives items with high values, such as 0 and 5.
   - Agent 1 receives items with moderate values to balance their lower total valuation, such as 6.
   - Agent 2 receives items with high values, such as 2 and 3.
   - Agent 3 receives items that contribute to balancing their total value, such as 1 and 4.

3. **Verify Total Items**: Ensure that exactly 7 items are allocated in total.

4. **Create JSON Output**: Format the allocation as specified.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
