Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  13  57  70  90  30  74
1  12  62  33  74  43  97  54
2  25  19  89  98  45  88  51
3  89  85  68  34  26  11  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49 13 57 70 90 30 74]
 [12 62 33 74 43 97 54]
 [25 19 89 98 45 88 51]
 [89 85 68 34 26 11 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total valuation, without leaving any items unallocated. The allocation should also aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

Hereâ€™s one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has a strong preference for items 3, 4, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for items 2 and 3.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 0 and also values item 1.

Considering these preferences and aiming to balance the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 4 and 6.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 2 and 3.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share of their valued items while all 7 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
