Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  96  10  93  80  12  60
1  81  87   6  43  99  52  63
2  92  34  24  13  21   2  56
3  40  43  94  75  83  34  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider their preferences (valuations) for each item. We'll try to distribute items such that the total valuation for each agent is balanced as much as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (96) and 3 (93).
   - Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 (99) and 0 (81).
   - Assign items 4 and 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 0 (92) and 6 (56).
   - However, item 0 is already assigned to Agent 1, so we consider the next highest.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (94) and 6 (85).
   - Item 6 is assigned to Agent 2, so we consider item 2.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
   - Since each agent needs to have at least one item, assign item 5 to Agent 3.

The allocation ensures each agent receives items with the highest possible valuations available to them, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
