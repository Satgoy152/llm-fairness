Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  45  84  46  61   2  93
1   2  45  32  67  78  96   3
2  95  76  12  41  21  91  55
3  82  84  61  88   8  51   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among 4 agents, we should consider both the valuations and the number of items each agent receives. Since each agent should receive an integer number of items and only 7 items are available, let's aim to allocate them to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 (95) and item 6 (93) the highest compared to other items. Allocating these two items to Agent 0 seems reasonable.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 5 (96) the highest. Allocating item 5 to Agent 1 would maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 0 (95) and item 5 (91) the highest, but since those are already allocated, we look at item 1 (76), which is the next highest. Allocating item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Agent 3 values item 3 (88) and item 1 (84) the highest. Item 1 is already allocated, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have assigned 5 items, with items 2 and 4 remaining. Let's allocate these remaining items:

- **Agent 2** could take item 4 (21) as it gives them some value.
- **Agent 3** could take item 2 (61) as it is the next highest valued unallocated item.

Let's allocate according to this plan:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
