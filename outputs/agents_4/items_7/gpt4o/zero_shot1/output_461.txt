Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  57  56  64  96  65  63
1   2  66  53  54  78   0   0
2  73  45  98  50  36  72  97
3  49  77  17  71  23  26  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. This problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm or other allocation strategies. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high values for most items, especially item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 and 2 relatively high.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high values for items 2, 5, and 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 highly.

Let's allocate items based on maximizing each agent's value:

- **Item 4** to Agent 0 (value 96).
- **Item 1** to Agent 3 (value 77).
- **Item 2** to Agent 2 (value 98).
- **Item 5** to Agent 2 (value 72).
- **Item 6** to Agent 2 (value 97).
- **Item 0** to Agent 0 (value 58).
- **Item 3** to Agent 1 (value 54).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, and all items are distributed.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5, 6],
    "3": [1]
}
```
