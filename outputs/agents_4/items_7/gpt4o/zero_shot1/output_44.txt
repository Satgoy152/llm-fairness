Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  51  73  51  60   8  46
1  57  80  62  99  71  48  12
2  13  39  68  52  50  98  44
3  40  77  28  47  55  26  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

To achieve this, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them such that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is maximized. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 3 has a relatively even distribution but no extremely high valuations compared to the others.

Now, let's propose a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 2. This gives Agent 0 a high total valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1, 3, and 4. These are the items with the highest valuations for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5. This is the highest valuation item for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6. This is the leftover item, and Agent 3 doesn't have a particularly high valuation for any item, so it receives the least valued item.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6]
}
```
