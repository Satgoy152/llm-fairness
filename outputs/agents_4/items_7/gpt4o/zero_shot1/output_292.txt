Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  31  75   6   8  30  91
1  85  18  80  83  57  12  60
2  67  96  65  15  32  85  32
3  71  70  53  77  93  19  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. This is a combinatorial optimization problem that can be approached with various strategies. One simple approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations until all items are allocated. 

We'll proceed with a heuristic approach to achieve a balanced and fair allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Adjust assignments if any agent has an unreasonably high number of items compared to others.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (85).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (96).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (75).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (83).
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (93).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (85).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (91).

Now, let's check the current allocation:

- Agent 0 has items [2, 6].
- Agent 1 has items [0, 3].
- Agent 2 has items [1, 5].
- Agent 3 has item [4].

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and distributes the items based on maximum valuations. The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This way, we have fairly distributed all 7 items among the 4 agents.
