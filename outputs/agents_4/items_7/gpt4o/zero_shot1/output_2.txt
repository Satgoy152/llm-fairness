Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  40  49  75  68  58  98
1  44  15   0  79  81  51  29
2  23  84  54  60  41  13  16
3   2  84  15  75  93  41  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 84 15 75 93 41 79]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation where each agent receives items that maximize their respective valuations. Since there are 7 items and 4 agents, at least one agent will receive 2 items and the others will receive 1 item each. 

Let's approach this by allocating the items to the agents based on the highest valuations they have for the items, while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value for items: Item 6 (98), Item 3 (75)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for items: Item 4 (81), Item 3 (79)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value for items: Item 1 (84), Item 2 (54)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value for items: Item 4 (93), Item 1 (84)
   - Item 4 is already allocated, so allocate Item 3 (75) to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items 0, 2, and 5 are still available.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value 4).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest value 54).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest value 51).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

Each agent now has at least one item, and all items have been allocated fairly based on the agents' highest valuations.
