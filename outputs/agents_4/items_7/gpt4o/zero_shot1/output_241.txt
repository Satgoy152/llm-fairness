Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  10  57  34  52  28  12
1   0  55  15  23  37  51   4
2  57  35  70  17   1  97  22
3  91  74  64  94   4  54   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Highest value for item 2 (57)
   - Agent 1: Highest value for item 1 (55)
   - Agent 2: Highest value for item 5 (97)
   - Agent 3: Highest value for item 3 (94)

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items 0, 4, and 6 are left for allocation.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 91 for Agent 3)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 52 for Agent 0)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 4 for Agent 1)

4. **Ensure Fair Distribution:**
   - Each agent should be fairly considered based on their preference.
   - Each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Based on the above reasoning, the allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items, and the allocation is fair based on the values provided.
