Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  16  24  97  51  13  25
1  16  22  77   4  86  31  70
2  47  37  86  49  14  17  31
3  13  80   6   4  45   7  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly (value of 97).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (value of 86).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 highly (value of 86).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 highly (value of 80).

2. **Assign the Highest Valued Items:**
   - Assign item 3 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 2.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 3.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 0, 5, and 6.
   - Distribute these items considering remaining capacities and second-highest preferences.

   - Agent 0 has item 3, and they value item 0 next (value of 71), assign item 0 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has item 4, and they value item 6 next (value of 70), assign item 6 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 has item 2, and they value item 5 next (value of 17), assign item 5 to agent 2.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - All items are now allocated, and each agent has received at least one item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution of items reflects the agents' preferences as much as possible given the constraints.
