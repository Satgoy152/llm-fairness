Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  22   0  86  12  74   2
1  84  57  34   0  46  10  75
2  23  37  58  83  80  35  81
3  43  42  83  61  81  56  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to aim for a distribution where each agent gets items that have relatively high value to them, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the situation:

We have 4 agents and 7 items. To fairly allocate, each agent should ideally get at least 1 item, and one agent can get 2 items to cover all 7 items.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3, so we'll allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 0, so we'll allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most, so we'll allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most, so we'll allocate item 4 to agent 3.
- Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 1, 5, and 6.

For the remaining items:
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation of item 6, so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 3 also has a relatively high valuation of item 5, so item 5 goes to agent 3.
- Finally, agent 2 has a relatively good valuation for item 1, so item 1 goes to agent 2.

This distribution ensures all agents get at least one item and the total value distributed is relatively high for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
