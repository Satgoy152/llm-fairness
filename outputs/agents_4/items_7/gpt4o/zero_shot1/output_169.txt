Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  94  15  11  98  96  15
1  96  25  10  59  35  59  95
2  34  25  56  75  16  31  93
3  27  56  68  55  13  15  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately the same total value. This approach is not necessarily about maximizing total value but about fairness in allocation.

Let's start by calculating the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 33 + 94 + 15 + 11 + 98 + 96 + 15 = 362
- Agent 1: 96 + 25 + 10 + 59 + 35 + 59 + 95 = 379
- Agent 2: 34 + 25 + 56 + 75 + 16 + 31 + 93 = 330
- Agent 3: 27 + 56 + 68 + 55 + 13 + 15 + 50 = 284

Now, allocate the items by iterating over each item and assigning it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (96).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (94).
3. Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most (68).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (75).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (98).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (96).
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (93).

This process can lead to some agents receiving more items than others, so we need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness. Let's refine it:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 4
- Agent 1 gets items: 0
- Agent 2 gets items: 3, 6
- Agent 3 gets items: 2, 5

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
