Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  19  12  39  57  69  35
1  40  49  47  29  50  30  52
2  75  23  97  17   8  80  54
3  33  75  71  83  39  97   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's distribute the items based on the highest value each agent places on the items:

1. **Assign item 2 to agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 97.
2. **Assign item 5 to agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 97.
3. **Assign item 0 to agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 second highest at 75.
4. **Assign item 4 to agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 57.
5. **Assign item 3 to agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the second highest at 83.
6. **Assign item 6 to agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 6 the highest at 52.
7. **Assign item 1 to agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 third highest at 75.

Based on this allocation strategy, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are distributed, and the values are considered to maximize each agent's satisfaction.
