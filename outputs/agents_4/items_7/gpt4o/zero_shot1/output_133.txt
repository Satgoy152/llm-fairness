Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  96   5  85  66  27  95
1  50  86  95   3  58  70   4
2  96   3   7   7  23  71  84
3  11  12  22  34  62  15  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This process is similar to solving an assignment problem.

Let's take a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 1 highly (96), so we can allocate item 1 to them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 highly (95), so we can allocate item 2 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 highly (96), so we can allocate item 0 to them.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 4 (62), so we can allocate item 4 to them.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items: 3, 5, and 6.

5. **Agent 0** already has item 1, but they also value item 6 highly (95), so we can allocate item 6 to them.
6. **Agent 1** has item 2, and their next highest value is item 5 (70), so we can allocate item 5 to them.
7. **Agent 2** has item 0, and the next highest value among the remaining items for them is item 3 (7), so we can allocate item 3 to them.

Now, let's compile the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all 7 items are allocated.
