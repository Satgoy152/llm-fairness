Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  31  36  83   2  19  41
1  19  56  86  37  92  50   1
2  82  57  10  17  63  24  91
3  91  40  49  40  65   7  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19 56 86 37 92 50  1]
 [82 57 10 17 63 24 91]
 [91 40 49 40 65  7 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A common approach to achieve this is using a greedy method where we assign the highest value item that has not been allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 92.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 86.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 with a value of 91.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 3.

4. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 91.
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2.

5. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 83.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 56.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

7. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 50.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.

Finally, the allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the happiness of each agent based on their valuations.
