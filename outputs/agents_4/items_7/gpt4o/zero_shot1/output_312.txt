Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  82  34  58  40  30  99
1  20  53  66  93  92  93  53
2  35   6  78  42  37  63  17
3  96  42  47  34  53  61   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and distribute the items such that each agent gets a valuable allocation for them. One way to do this is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by considering their preferences.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [51, 82, 34, 58, 40, 30, 99]
- Agent 1: [20, 53, 66, 93, 92, 93, 53]
- Agent 2: [35, 6, 78, 42, 37, 63, 17]
- Agent 3: [96, 42, 47, 34, 53, 61, 4]

We will try to assign the items such that each agent gets their most preferred items available without overlap. After analyzing the valuations, we can make the following allocations:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 since it's their highest valued item (99).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since it's their highest valued item (93).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 since it's their highest valued item (78).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 since it's their highest valued item (96).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 4, and 5) while ensuring a fair distribution:

5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it's their second highest valued remaining item (82).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it's their next highest valued remaining item (93).
7. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it's their next highest valued remaining item (37).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This way, all items are allocated fairly among the agents based on their preferences.
