Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  54  37   0  23  14  51
1   7  92  12  39  14  51  53
2  30  33  34  22  30  18  16
3  94   7  19  86  99  44   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a simple greedy algorithm approach. We will allocate items based on the highest valuations until all items are distributed.

Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. Create a list of all items and their valuations for each agent.
2. Sort each list based on the valuation in descending order.
3. Allocate items to agents starting with the highest available valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest to lowest valuations: 1 (54), 6 (51), 2 (37), 4 (23), 5 (14), 0 (21), 3 (0)
- Agent 1: Highest to lowest valuations: 1 (92), 6 (53), 5 (51), 3 (39), 4 (14), 2 (12), 0 (7)
- Agent 2: Highest to lowest valuations: 2 (34), 1 (33), 0 (30), 4 (30), 3 (22), 5 (18), 6 (16)
- Agent 3: Highest to lowest valuations: 4 (99), 0 (94), 3 (86), 5 (44), 2 (19), 1 (7), 6 (6)

Steps for allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation 92).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest valuation 99).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation 94).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation 86).
5. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation 53).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation 51).
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation 34).

Now we can present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 6, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets an integer number of items.
