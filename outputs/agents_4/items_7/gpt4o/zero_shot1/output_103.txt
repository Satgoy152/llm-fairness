Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  31  54  74  34  16  49
1  74  83  55  50  29  59  56
2  74  86  84  87  88   5  29
3  44  80  42  91  38  24  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 83 55 50 29 59 56]
 [74 86 84 87 88  5 29]
 [44 80 42 91 38 24 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We also need to ensure that all 7 items are allocated.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3.
- **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1.
- **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 6.
- **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 3.

A potential allocation strategy is to assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent while avoiding conflicts:

1. **Assign item 0** to Agent 0 since they value it highly.
2. **Assign item 1** to Agent 1 as they value it the highest compared to other agents.
3. **Assign item 2** to Agent 0 since they value it highly.
4. **Assign item 3** to Agent 2 as they value it the highest.
5. **Assign item 4** to Agent 2 as they also have a high valuation for it.
6. **Assign item 5** to Agent 1 as they have a relatively higher valuation compared to others.
7. **Assign item 6** to Agent 3 since it is one of their better options and other high valuations have been assigned.

This allocation method attempts to give each agent items they value highly, maximizing their satisfaction.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value and all items are allocated.
