Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  48   7  89  31   4   7
1  97  14  30  52  80  78  84
2  32  95  50  24   9  59  26
3  78  66   1  87   6  20  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 48  7 89 31  4  7]
 [97 14 30 52 80 78 84]
 [32 95 50 24  9 59 26]
 [78 66  1 87  6 20 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both the valuations and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, with a total of 7 items allocated.

Let's consider the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 50 + 48 + 7 + 89 + 31 + 4 + 7 = 236
- Agent 1: 97 + 14 + 30 + 52 + 80 + 78 + 84 = 435
- Agent 2: 32 + 95 + 50 + 24 + 9 + 59 + 26 = 295
- Agent 3: 78 + 66 + 1 + 87 + 6 + 20 + 82 = 340

We can aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation.

Let's assign items as follows:

1. Agent 0: Has high value for item 3 (89) and item 0 (50).
2. Agent 1: Has high value for item 0 (97) and item 6 (84).
3. Agent 2: Has high value for item 1 (95) and item 5 (59).
4. Agent 3: Has high value for item 3 (87) and item 6 (82), but since item 3 is already allocated, consider item 4 (6).

Now, try to allocate without conflicts and maximize each agent's valuation based on this initial analysis:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 3
- Agent 1: Allocate item 0 and item 6
- Agent 2: Allocate item 1 and item 5
- Agent 3: Allocate item 4

Now, let's check if any items are left unallocated:

Allocated items: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6

Unallocated item: 2

We can allocate the remaining item (item 2) to Agent 2, who has a relatively moderate interest in it.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 5, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.
