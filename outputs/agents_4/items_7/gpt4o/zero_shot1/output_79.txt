Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52   8  36  47  42   1   1
1  25  19  73  39  86  16  57
2  19  88  20  11  85  56  85
3  21  34  51  32  98  81  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52  8 36 47 42  1  1]
 [25 19 73 39 86 16 57]
 [19 88 20 11 85 56 85]
 [21 34 51 32 98 81 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the provided valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuation for item 0 (52).
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuation for item 4 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuation for item 1 (88).
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuation for item 5 (81).

After allocating one high-value item to each agent, we allocate the remaining items to maximize the total valuation:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (73).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (47).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (85).

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated.
