Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  96  53  43  20  77  12
1  82  13  60  42  59  31  73
2  28  61  36  96   4  50   8
3  25  55  71  28  99  44  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 4 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others. A reasonable approach is to ensure that each agent receives at least one high-value item and then distribute the remaining items based on the next highest valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 1 (96)
   - Item 5 (77)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0 (82)
   - Item 6 (73)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 3 (96)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 4 (99)
   - Item 2 (71)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```
