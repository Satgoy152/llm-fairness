Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  39  23  10  56  78  32
1  11  93  59  27  60  72  77
2  65  93  47  26  75  19  17
3   3  32   2  81  67  17  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 93 59 27 60 72 77]
 [65 93 47 26 75 19 17]
 [ 3 32  2 81 67 17 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent gets. We will try to assign items to agents such that the total value each agent receives is approximately balanced, considering their individual preferences for the items.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on maximizing individual valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (78), Item 4 (56)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (93), Item 6 (77)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (93), Item 4 (75)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (81), Item 6 (79)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3.

Now let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** can take Item 0 (36) as it has a decent valuation and is unallocated.
- **Agent 1** can take Item 2 (59) as it has a good valuation and is unallocated.
- **Agent 3** can take Item 3 (81) as it has the highest valuation for this item and is unallocated.

Finally, let's ensure all 7 items are allocated:

- **Agent 2** can take Item 2 (47) to balance the allocations since items 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are already assigned.

This leads to the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item (except for Agent 2 who has been adjusted to balance the situation), and the total number of items allocated is 7.
