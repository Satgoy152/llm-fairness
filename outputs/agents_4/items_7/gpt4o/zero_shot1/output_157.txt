Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  42  59  72  16  45  68
1  72  65  58  14  54  40  88
2  79  39  52  65  47   6  60
3  34  37  34  44  64  31   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and the overall distribution is as equitable as possible based on their valuations. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 3 the highest (72), followed by item 6 (68). We can assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 the highest (72), followed by item 6 (88). We can assign item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 the highest (79), followed by item 3 (65). We can assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 4 the highest (64), followed by items 1 and 2 (both 37). We can assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we have assigned 4 items, and we need to assign the remaining 3 items: 1, 2, and 5. We will distribute them based on the remaining highest values:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 42).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 58).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 6).

This ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible based on the given valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 4 agents, and each agent receives at least one item.
