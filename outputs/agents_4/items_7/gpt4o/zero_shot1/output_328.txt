Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  15  64  69  28  85  93
1  48  68  68  67  34  33  49
2  44  94  76   0  54  23  41
3  11   6  14  19  23  15  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that balances the total valuation each agent receives. We will attempt to distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is as close as possible, considering that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the values agents place on the items:

| Agent | Items and their values |
|-------|------------------------|
| 0     | 0: 0, 1: 15, 2: 64, 3: 69, 4: 28, 5: 85, 6: 93 |
| 1     | 0: 48, 1: 68, 2: 68, 3: 67, 4: 34, 5: 33, 6: 49 |
| 2     | 0: 44, 1: 94, 2: 76, 3: 0, 4: 54, 5: 23, 6: 41 |
| 3     | 0: 11, 1: 6, 2: 14, 3: 19, 4: 23, 5: 15, 6: 61 |

Aiming for a fair allocation, let's go through potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 values item 6 the most, we will assign item 6 to agent 0. This gives agent 0 a value of 93.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the most, so we'll assign item 1 to agent 1. This gives agent 1 a value of 68.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most, but since it's already allocated, we'll assign item 2, which agent 2 values highly (76). This gives agent 2 a value of 76.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 6 the most, but since it's already allocated, we'll assign item 4, which agent 3 values at 23.

Now, we have allocated items 6, 1, 2, and 4. We still need to allocate three more items.

5. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as it has a high valuation (85) for that agent.
6. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as it has a high valuation (48) for that agent.
7. Assign item 3 to agent 3, as it yields a reasonable valuation (19) for that agent.

Let's ensure only 7 items are allocated, and each agent has items:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 0]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: Items [4, 3]

Now, the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
