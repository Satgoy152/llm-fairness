Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  66  23  43  86  62   4
1  52  59  17  97  89  20   6
2  93  99  19  23  56  97  62
3  49  27  41  82  71  68  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 66 23 43 86 62  4]
 [52 59 17 97 89 20  6]
 [93 99 19 23 56 97 62]
 [49 27 41 82 71 68 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, given there are 7 items and 4 agents. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Rank the items based on how much each agent values them.
2. Allocate items starting from the highest value for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. Continue to allocate remaining items to maximize the total valuation across all agents.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly (value 86), so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly (value 97), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly (value 99), so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly (value 80), so allocate item 6 to agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining items (0, 2, 5) to maximize total valuation:

- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (value 97), as it maximizes the value.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (value 93), as it is the highest remaining value.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 23), as Agent 0 has fewer items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5, 0],
    "3": [6]
}
```
