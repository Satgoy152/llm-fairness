Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  88  33   6  93  79  58
1  47  84  11  72  44  11  63
2  39  44  38  83  17  88  39
3   0  80  78  70  93  97  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[45 88 33  6 93 79 58]
 [47 84 11 72 44 11 63]
 [39 44 38 83 17 88 39]
 [ 0 80 78 70 93 97 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the items. Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Highest Valuation Selection**: Start by assigning each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, provided that item hasn't been assigned yet.

2. **Iterative Assignment**: Continue assigning remaining items to agents based on the next highest valuation for the remaining unallocated items.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 4 (93).
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (47).
- **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5 (88).
- **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 6 (99).

At this point, each agent has one item. Let's allocate the remaining three items (1, 2, and 3):

- **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 1 (88).
- **Agent 3** has the next highest valuation for item 5 (97) but it's already taken, so next is item 2 (78).
- **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 3 (72).

Now each item is allocated fairly among the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```

Each agent has at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated.
