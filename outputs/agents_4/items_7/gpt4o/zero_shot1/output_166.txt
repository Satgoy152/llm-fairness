Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  29   9  36  18  20  32
1  17  57  92  69  89  38  92
2  60  43  90  55  48  63  97
3  93  26  53  25  57  98  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 26 53 25 57 98 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy algorithm to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 93.
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 57.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 92.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 69.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 89.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 98.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 97.

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, maximizing fairness in terms of valuation.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.
