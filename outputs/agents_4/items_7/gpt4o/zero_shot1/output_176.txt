Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  86   5  72  22  76  81
1  89  51  83  25  70  78  98
2  66  12  95  30  43  97  85
3  61  22  28  72  48  99  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one strategy is to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (86), Item 5 (76)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 6 (98), Item 0 (89)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (97), Item 2 (95)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (99), Item 0 (61)

Since some items have multiple high valuations among different agents, let's distribute the items as evenly as possible while also considering these preferences:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1 (86) and Item 5 (76)
- Agent 1 receives Item 6 (98) and Item 3 (25)
- Agent 2 receives Item 2 (95)
- Agent 3 receives Item 0 (61) and Item 4 (48)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Item 1, Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 6, Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0, Item 4

This distribution ensures that each agent gets a fair share, and all items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
