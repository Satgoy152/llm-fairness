Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  37  25   8  30   0  45
1  18  39   9  53   5  73  95
2  19  94  40  39  15  49   0
3  46  79  28  43  48  23  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing their total valuation, we will consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to distribute the items so that the total valuation for each agent is maximized. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by examining each agent's highest-valued items:
   - Agent 0: Highest value is item 6 (value 45).
   - Agent 1: Highest value is item 6 (value 95).
   - Agent 2: Highest value is item 1 (value 94).
   - Agent 3: Highest value is item 1 (value 79).

2. Allocate the highest-valued items to each agent where possible, while ensuring no item is allocated more than once:
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (next highest value for Agent 3).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest value).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (next highest value).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (next highest value).

3. Ensure each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Adjust if necessary to maximize satisfaction of all agents.

The allocation can be represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
