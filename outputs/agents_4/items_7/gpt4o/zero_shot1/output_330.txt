Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  79   0  70  80  99   1
1  75  31  26  89   7  64  21
2  94  50  51  83  95  60  72
3   8  80  71  84  49  30  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuation for Each Item:**
   - **Item 0:** Highest value is 94 by Agent 2.
   - **Item 1:** Highest value is 80 by both Agent 0 and Agent 3.
   - **Item 2:** Highest value is 71 by Agent 3.
   - **Item 3:** Highest value is 89 by Agent 1.
   - **Item 4:** Highest value is 95 by Agent 2.
   - **Item 5:** Highest value is 99 by Agent 0.
   - **Item 6:** Highest value is 72 by Agent 2.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. If there's a tie, consider the overall distribution and try to keep the allocation balanced.

3. **Initial Allocation:**
   - **Agent 0:** Items 1, 5
   - **Agent 1:** Item 3
   - **Agent 2:** Items 0, 4, 6
   - **Agent 3:** Item 2

4. **Check for Fairness and Adjust if Necessary:**
   - Agent 0: 2 items
   - Agent 1: 1 item
   - Agent 2: 3 items
   - Agent 3: 1 item

The allocation seems balanced, considering the highest valuations and the number of items each agent receives.

5. **Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4, 6],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while distributing the items as evenly as possible among the agents.
