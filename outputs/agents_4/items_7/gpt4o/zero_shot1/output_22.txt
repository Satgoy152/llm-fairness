Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  36  80  74  95  71   6
1  23  43  76  90  49  84  18
2   7  22  93  66  45  31  10
3  57  45  60  61  77  69  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 36 80 74 95 71  6]
 [23 43 76 90 49 84 18]
 [ 7 22 93 66 45 31 10]
 [57 45 60 61 77 69 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation per agent.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 4: Value 95
   - Item 0: Value 90

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 3: Value 90
   - Item 5: Value 84

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 2: Value 93

4. Agent 3:
   - Item 6: Value 59
   - Item 1: Value 45

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7. Below is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 1]
}
```
