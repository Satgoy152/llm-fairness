Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  44   3  48  31  84  87
1   1  25  26   7  29  67  16
2  19  89  77  69  41  44   8
3   9  55  70  91  97  37  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to maximize the satisfaction of each agent. We can utilize a greedy strategy, allocating the highest-valued available item to each agent in turn until all items are distributed. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item: Item 6 (value 87)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (value 67)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 89)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value 97)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items:** 0, 2, 3

6. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - **Agent 0:**
     - Next highest value item: Item 0 (value 78)
     - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

   - **Agent 1:**
     - Next highest value item: Item 3 (value 7)
     - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

   - **Agent 2:**
     - Next highest value item: Item 2 (value 77)
     - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated all 7 items. Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
