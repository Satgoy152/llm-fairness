Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  14  90  22  20  88  62
1   8  34  61  65  85  23  34
2  36  57  91  98  66   5  46
3  36  97  28  38  96  51  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 14 90 22 20 88 62]
 [ 8 34 61 65 85 23 34]
 [36 57 91 98 66  5 46]
 [36 97 28 38 96 51 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that considers the highest valuations first. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 97. Assign item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1 has the highest value for item 4 at 85. Assign item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 98. Assign item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 97. Assign item 1 to agent 3.

Now we have assigned 4 items, and we need to allocate the remaining 3 items.

5. **Agent 0:** The next highest value is for item 5, which agent 0 values at 88. Assign item 5 to agent 0.

6. **Agent 2:** The next highest unallocated item for agent 2 is item 2, valued at 91. Assign item 2 to agent 2.

7. **Agent 3:** The last item is item 6, which agent 3 values at 38. Assign item 6 to agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
