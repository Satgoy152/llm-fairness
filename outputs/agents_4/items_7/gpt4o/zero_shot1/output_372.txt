Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  82  99  48   1  26  90
1  25   8  27  27  99  76  45
2  99  81   8  75   3  47  95
3  72  63  67  17  22  29  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to balance the total value of items each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Let's approach this by considering a strategy where each agent receives as close to an equal share of their maximum possible valuation across the items.

One possible allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items, and then aim to allocate items to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

2. Allocate items one by one, considering the highest valuation for each remaining item and assigning it to the agent who values it the most, provided that it helps in balancing the total valuations.

Let's perform this allocation step by step:

- Agent 0's highest-valued items: 2 (99), 6 (90), 1 (82)
- Agent 1's highest-valued items: 4 (99), 5 (76)
- Agent 2's highest-valued items: 0 (99), 6 (95)
- Agent 3's highest-valued items: 0 (72), 2 (67)

**Allocations:**
- Item 0: Assigned to Agent 2 (value 99)
- Item 1: Assigned to Agent 0 (value 82)
- Item 2: Assigned to Agent 0 (value 99)
- Item 3: Assigned to Agent 2 (value 75)
- Item 4: Assigned to Agent 1 (value 99)
- Item 5: Assigned to Agent 1 (value 76)
- Item 6: Assigned to Agent 3 (value 31)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total valuation based on their preferences, while all items are distributed.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated and considers the agents' preferences to balance the total values they receive.
