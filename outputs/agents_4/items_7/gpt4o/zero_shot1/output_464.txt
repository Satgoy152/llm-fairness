Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2   7  84   3  12  45   5
1  17  78  30   3  71  16  81
2  39  61  26  85  92   1  41
3  68  87  68  34  98  52  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. A possible strategy is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 68.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most at 87.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most at 85.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most at 98.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 45.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 5
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1, 4

This allocation respects the condition that each item is assigned to only one agent and attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring a fair distribution.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
