Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  73  15   7  10  87  72
1  19   0  33  83  23  81  77
2  12  35  27  28  48  73  36
3  56  60  14  69  75  22  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize each agent's overall satisfaction by considering their valuations for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences, ensuring that all 7 items are allocated and that each agent receives an integer number of items. 

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated. Here's how it can be done:

1. List all items with their respective agent valuations.
2. Sort the list by the highest valuation first.
3. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
4. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's perform this procedure:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (87)
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (73)
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (33)
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (83)
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (75)
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (87)
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (77)

Now, let's allocate these items ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 5
2. Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 6
3. Agent 2: (No items given)
4. Agent 3: Item 4

Now the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while maximizing their individual valuations and ensuring at least one item is allocated to each agent who values it highly.
