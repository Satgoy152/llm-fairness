Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  48  69   6  89  81  87
1  48  28  19  41  16  84  94
2  15  69  79  96  66  50  91
3   8  63  56  47  22  36  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

One possible approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how it could work:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent has an integer number of items, which, given there are 7 items and 4 agents, will mean some agents will get 1 or 2 items.

Let's apply this approach to the given valuations:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 0 (25).
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 2 (69).
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 2 (79).
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 2 (96).
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (89).
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 1 (84).
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 1 (94).

Here's the allocation based on the highest valuation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 5 and 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, and 3
- Agent 3: No items

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 3],
    "3": []
}
```
