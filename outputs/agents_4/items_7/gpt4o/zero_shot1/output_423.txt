Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  93  51  26  70  92  77
1  56  51  25  50  75  71  45
2  90  87  89  48  66  11  30
3  54  38   3  71  39  77  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we can attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. A common approach to this problem is to use a method that aims to balance the allocation so that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that no agent is left without items unless it's unavoidable due to the number of items versus the number of agents.

Let's consider the valuations and make allocations that try to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for item 1 (93) and item 5 (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Has a relatively even spread, but the highest value is item 4 (75).
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for item 0 (90) and item 2 (89).
4. **Agent 3**: Has a high valuation for item 5 (77).

We will try to allocate the items such that each agent gets the items they value the most, while ensuring each item is allocated only once and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Based on this analysis, here is a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 5]
- **Agent 1**: Item [4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 2]
- **Agent 3**: Items [3, 6]

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent some of their highest-valued items, while ensuring that all items are allocated.
