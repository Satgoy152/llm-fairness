Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  10  24  93   4   6  75
1   6   8  17  80  93  87  94
2  32  11  60  85  79  63  22
3  54  57  50  31  48  96  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total value while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation approach based on maximizing each agent's utility:

1. **Agent 0**: Evaluate the values for each item.
   - Highest valued items: Item 3 (93), Item 6 (75)
   - Allocate: Items 3 and 6

2. **Agent 1**: Evaluate the values for each item.
   - Highest valued items: Item 6 (94), Item 4 (93)
   - Allocate: Item 4

3. **Agent 2**: Evaluate the values for each item.
   - Highest valued items: Item 3 (85), Item 2 (60)
   - Allocate: Item 2

4. **Agent 3**: Evaluate the values for each item.
   - Highest valued items: Item 5 (96), Item 1 (57)
   - Allocate: Items 0, 1, and 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, and all items are distributed. 

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation allows agents to receive items they value highly, distributing all items fairly.
