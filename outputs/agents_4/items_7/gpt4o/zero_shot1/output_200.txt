Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  38  34  22  62  89  10
1  51  10  19  28  89  24   5
2  31  97  29  52  88  26  17
3  86  90  61  33  47  87  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items so that the total valuation each agent receives is as even as possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each item across agents**: We should allocate items to agents who value them the most to maximize the overall satisfaction.

2. **Sort items by value for each agent**: This will help in determining which items are most valued by each agent.

3. **Assign items to maximize total value for each agent**: Start by assigning the items with the highest valuations to the corresponding agents.

4. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible**: To maintain fairness, try to distribute the items so no agent is left with nothing, unless it's unavoidable.

5. **Check total allocations**: Make sure that exactly 7 items are allocated in total, as required by the problem statement.

Applying this strategy, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (value of 89), so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (value of 89), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (value of 97), so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (value of 86), so allocate item 0 to agent 3.

At this point, each agent has one item. Now, distribute the remaining items (2, 3, 6) to maximize value:

- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 6 (value of 66), so allocate item 6 to agent 3.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3 (value of 52), so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
- Item 2 is left, and agent 3 values it the most (value of 61), so allocate item 2 to agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the distribution maximizes the total valuation.
