Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  86  47  72  43  42  70
1  93  84  89  52  14  31  61
2  86  88  50   9  49  24  56
3  37  19  82  83  86  47  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is maximized.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations for Each Item**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. If there is a tie, randomly choose one of the agents with the highest valuation.

2. **Allocate Items to Agents**: Based on the above step, allocate the items to the agents.

Let's break down the process:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by agent 1 (93).
- Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 2 (88).
- Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 1 (89).
- Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 3 (83).
- Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 3 (86).
- Item 5: Highest valuation by agent 0 (42).
- Item 6: Highest valuation by agent 0 (70).

**Allocations**:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent receives an integer number of items, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
