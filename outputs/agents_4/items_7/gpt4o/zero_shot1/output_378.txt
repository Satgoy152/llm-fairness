Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  27  68  93  71  63  25
1  51  18  85  47  81  16   9
2  66  32  34  48  80  17  38
3  78  29  68   4  13  39  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from the items they receive. We will also ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 4 highly, but since it's already assigned to agent 0, we can consider item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent doesn't have very high valuations, but item 5 and 6 are somewhat valuable.

Allocating based on maximizing the individual agent's total valuation:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items 0 and 3
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 2 
- **Agent 2**: Gets item 4 
- **Agent 3**: Gets items 1, 5, and 6 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation balances the number of items among the agents while trying to respect their preferences as much as possible.
