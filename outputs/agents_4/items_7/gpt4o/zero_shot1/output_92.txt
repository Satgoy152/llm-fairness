Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  38  87  84  92   3  56
1  59  15   9   1  87  33  70
2  71  58  42  18   8  33  17
3  68  40  79  55  33  49  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 4: value 92 (highest value for any agent for this item)
   - Item 0: value 48

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 6: value 70 (highest value for agent 1 for any unallocated item)
   - Item 1: value 15

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 5: value 33

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 2: value 79 (highest value for agent 3 for any unallocated item)
   - Item 3: value 55

With this allocation, each agent receives a fair share of the total value of the items based on their valuations. Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
