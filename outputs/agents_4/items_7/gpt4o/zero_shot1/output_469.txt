Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  29  89  79  38   9  18
1  61  91  34  69  73  96  31
2  68  50  19  94  85  95  89
3  88  83  31  97  23  63  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider maximizing the total value that each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated.

Let's use a strategy to ensure a fair allocation by assigning items to agents based on the highest individual valuations, while also balancing the total number of items each agent receives.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Identify Highest Values for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 88 (highest)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 91 (highest)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 89 (highest)
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values it at 97 (highest)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 85 (highest)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 96 (highest)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 89 (highest)

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 3 receives items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1 and 5.
   - Agent 0 receives item 2.
   - Agent 2 receives items 4 and 6.

3. **Check Balance and Total:**
   - Agent 0: 1 item
   - Agent 1: 2 items
   - Agent 2: 2 items
   - Agent 3: 2 items

This ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all 7 items are allocated.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation respects the preferences as much as possible based on the highest available valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
