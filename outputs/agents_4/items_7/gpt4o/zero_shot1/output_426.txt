Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  96  25  36  79  57  59
1  53  35  48  28  16   5  77
2  64  10  46  97   9  29   1
3  32  64   6   8   4  91   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Determine the highest valuation for each item**: For each item, identify which agent values it the most. This helps ensure that items are allocated where they are most valued.

2. **Initial allocation based on highest valuation**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Adjust for fairness**: Check if any agent has too many or too few items. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent has a fair number of items, considering that some may have higher valuations overall.

4. **Final allocation**: Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent's allocation maximizes their total valuation.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Highest value is 64 by Agent 2.
- Item 1: Highest value is 96 by Agent 0.
- Item 2: Highest value is 48 by Agent 1.
- Item 3: Highest value is 97 by Agent 2.
- Item 4: Highest value is 79 by Agent 0.
- Item 5: Highest value is 91 by Agent 3.
- Item 6: Highest value is 77 by Agent 1.

Initial allocation based on these values:
- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [2, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 3]
- Agent 3: [5]

This allocation is already fairly distributed as each agent has at least one item, and none of the items are left unallocated. Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5]
}
```
