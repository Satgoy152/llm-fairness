Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88   9  19  64  95  63  77
1  30  98  10  93  91  31   0
2  87  87  62   9  96  39  63
3  79  22  55   5  61  13   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88  9 19 64 95 63 77]
 [30 98 10 93 91 31  0]
 [87 87 62  9 96 39 63]
 [79 22 55  5 61 13  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value of the items. Here’s a possible allocation strategy that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and consider these totals when making allocations.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 88 + 9 + 19 + 64 + 95 + 63 + 77 = 415
- Agent 1: 30 + 98 + 10 + 93 + 91 + 31 + 0 = 353
- Agent 2: 87 + 87 + 62 + 9 + 96 + 39 + 63 = 443
- Agent 3: 79 + 22 + 55 + 5 + 61 + 13 + 0 = 235

Next, we can allocate items by prioritizing higher valuations:

- Agent 0 should get items that maximize their total value.
- Agent 1 should also get items that maximize their value while considering what’s left.
- Agent 2 should receive items maximizing their total value.
- Agent 3, having the lowest total potential value, gets the remaining allocation.

Here's a possible item allocation based on these considerations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4 (88, 95)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3 (98, 93)
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6 (62, 63)
- Agent 3: Item 5 (13)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their respective total valuations within the available constraints.

Finally, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
