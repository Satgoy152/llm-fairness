Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  16  97  38  74  72  89
1  89   8  51  33  17  25  13
2  21  84  80  67  84  94  14
3  30  63  46  49  80  50  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[15 16 97 38 74 72 89]
 [89  8 51 33 17 25 13]
 [21 84 80 67 84 94 14]
 [30 63 46 49 80 50 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.

Let's start by analyzing the valuation table for each agent and item:

- Agent 0 values: [15, 16, 97, 38, 74, 72, 89]
- Agent 1 values: [89, 8, 51, 33, 17, 25, 13]
- Agent 2 values: [21, 84, 80, 67, 84, 94, 14]
- Agent 3 values: [30, 63, 46, 49, 80, 50, 43]

We will try to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Start by allocating the highest-valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (value 97)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (value 89)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (value 94)
   - Agent 3: Item 4 (value 80)

2. Remaining items to allocate: [1, 3, 6]

3. Allocate remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction:
   - Review remaining item valuations:
     - Item 1: [16, 8, 84, 63]
     - Item 3: [38, 33, 67, 49]
     - Item 6: [89, 13, 14, 43]

4. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (since they have the highest valuation of 89).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (since they have the highest valuation of 84).
6. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (since they have the second-highest valuation of 49).

This allocation ensures a fair distribution based on the highest valuations for each agent while using all items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [4, 3]
}
```
