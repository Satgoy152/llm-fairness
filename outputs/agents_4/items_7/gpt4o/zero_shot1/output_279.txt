Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51   6   1  14  94  47  99
1  61  35  38  87  84  19  34
2  99   1  44  13  31  33  61
3  82  68   6  53  89   5  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51  6  1 14 94 47 99]
 [61 35 38 87 84 19 34]
 [99  1 44 13 31 33 61]
 [82 68  6 53 89  5 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) while trying to maximize total value across all agents. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 6. We can assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3. We can assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 0 the most. We can assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4. We can assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Distribute remaining items:** Allocate the remaining items to maximize each agent's total value, ensuring each agent gets an item if possible and respecting their preferences.

Following this logic, here is an allocation that attempts to balance the values each agent receives:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [3, 2]
- Agent 2: [0, 5]
- Agent 3: [4, 1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall value is somewhat balanced.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```
