Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  24   9   5  50  98  29
1  68  92   3  23  51  58  39
2  94  22  17  31  33  45  27
3   4  63  84  84  63  67  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value of items each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
   - Allocate items 0, 1, and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Agent 1 has a very high valuation for item 1 (but it’s already allocated to Agent 0). 
   - Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 1, as they provide a good total value.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (but it’s already allocated to Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as it provides a reasonable value.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 6 (but item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1, and item 6 is allocated to Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3, as it’s still available and provides a high value.

With these considerations, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 7 items are allocated.
