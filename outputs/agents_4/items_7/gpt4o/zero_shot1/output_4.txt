Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  76  94  77  81  56  19
1  26  45  45  24  65  51  51
2  20  11  77  52  99  30  31
3  31  94  89  26  77  83  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will use a strategy that aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations for the items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: First, calculate the sum of valuations each agent has for all items.

2. **Determine Priority**: Assign items to agents based on who values them the most, while also attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.

3. **Allocate Items**: Begin assigning the items to the agents based on their individual valuations and the priority determined.

Let's apply this method:

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: Total Valuation = 31 + 76 + 94 + 77 + 81 + 56 + 19 = 434
- Agent 1: Total Valuation = 26 + 45 + 45 + 24 + 65 + 51 + 51 = 307
- Agent 2: Total Valuation = 20 + 11 + 77 + 52 + 99 + 30 + 31 = 320
- Agent 3: Total Valuation = 31 + 94 + 89 + 26 + 77 + 83 + 11 = 411

### Allocation Process:
1. **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 0 (31), assigned to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 3 (94), assigned to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 0 (94), assigned to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 0 (77), assigned to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 2 (99), assigned to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 3 (83), assigned to Agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value by Agent 1 (51), assigned to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:
Based on the above steps, here is the final allocation of items to agents:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a fair proportion of items based on their preferences and valuations, while ensuring that a total of 7 items are allocated.
