Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  82  53  45  33  78  17
1  80  47  73   7   2  35  54
2  33  66  21  95  96  72  53
3  51  93  32  65   5  76  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent may receive zero or more items.

Let's start by examining the valuations for each item and choosing the agent with the highest valuation for each item. This method involves a greedy strategy, which might not always yield the most balanced outcome but ensures a high valuation for each item.

1. **Item 0**: Valuation by agents: 
   - Agent 0: 1
   - Agent 1: 80
   - Agent 2: 33
   - Agent 3: 51
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (value 80)

2. **Item 1**: Valuation by agents: 
   - Agent 0: 82
   - Agent 1: 47
   - Agent 2: 66
   - Agent 3: 93
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (value 93)

3. **Item 2**: Valuation by agents: 
   - Agent 0: 53
   - Agent 1: 73
   - Agent 2: 21
   - Agent 3: 32
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (value 73)

4. **Item 3**: Valuation by agents: 
   - Agent 0: 45
   - Agent 1: 7
   - Agent 2: 95
   - Agent 3: 65
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (value 95)

5. **Item 4**: Valuation by agents: 
   - Agent 0: 33
   - Agent 1: 2
   - Agent 2: 96
   - Agent 3: 5
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (value 96)

6. **Item 5**: Valuation by agents: 
   - Agent 0: 78
   - Agent 1: 35
   - Agent 2: 72
   - Agent 3: 76
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (value 76)

7. **Item 6**: Valuation by agents: 
   - Agent 0: 17
   - Agent 1: 54
   - Agent 2: 53
   - Agent 3: 39
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (value 54)

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: No items.
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 6
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Items 1, 5

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
