Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  51   8  17  61  80  77
1  80  28  56  38  12  91  32
2   7   4  70  49  92  53   1
3  65  47  69  39  65  15  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value received by the agents while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share of items. Given the constraints, we aim to distribute 7 items among 4 agents.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [91, 51, 8, 17, 61, 80, 77]
Agent 1: [80, 28, 56, 38, 12, 91, 32]
Agent 2: [7, 4, 70, 49, 92, 53, 1]
Agent 3: [65, 47, 69, 39, 65, 15, 70]
```

A simple approach is to allocate items by maximizing the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each gets at least one item if possible. We will select items by the highest value for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 the highest.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and we need to allocate 3 more items. We will distribute these remaining items by considering the next highest values for the agents who can improve their total valuation:

- Agent 0's next highest value is item 5, but it's already taken. So, the next is item 6. Agent 0 can take item 1, which is not yet allocated.
- Agent 1's next highest value is item 0, but it's already taken. So, they can take item 2, which is not yet allocated.
- Agent 3's next highest value is item 2, but it's taken. They can take item 3, which is available.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6, 3]
}
```

This ensures a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
