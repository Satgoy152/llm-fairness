Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  81  68  81  54  45  27
1  92  65  17  37  96  47  38
2  89  55   8  19  90   0  33
3  57  17  48  96  27  15  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 81 68 81 54 45 27]
 [92 65 17 37 96 47 38]
 [89 55  8 19 90  0 33]
 [57 17 48 96 27 15 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. The goal is to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuations: Items 1 (81), 3 (81), and 0 (67)
   - Allocate items: 0 and 1 to Agent 0 for a total value of 148.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuations: Items 0 (92), 4 (96)
   - Allocate item: 4 to Agent 1 for a total value of 96.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuations: Items 0 (89), 4 (90)
   - Allocate item: 6 to Agent 2 for a total value of 33.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - High valuations: Items 3 (96)
   - Allocate items: 2, 3, and 5 to Agent 3 for a total value of 159.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempt ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all 7 items are distributed.
