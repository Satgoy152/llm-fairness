Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6   5  29  68  33  76  72
1  51  70  50  73  78  35  28
2  76  90  46  36  86  35   8
3  12   4  98   1  76  11  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6  5 29 68 33 76 72]
 [51 70 50 73 78 35 28]
 [76 90 46 36 86 35  8]
 [12  4 98  1 76 11 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent, considering their preferences. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 5 (76), then item 6 (72).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (78), then item 1 (70).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (90), then item 4 (86).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (98).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. Let's allocate the remaining 3 items:

5. **Agent 0:**
   - Next highest valuation is for item 3 (68).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1:**
   - Next highest valuation is for item 3 (73). However, item 3 is already allocated.
   - Next available highest valuation is for item 0 (51).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2:**
   - Next available highest valuation is for item 6 (8).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

The allocation is complete, and each agent has received an integer number of items with a total of 7 items allocated. 

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2]
}
```
