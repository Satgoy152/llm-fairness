Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  23  15  39  23  98  45
1   8  42  17  37  31  62  66
2  48  52  81  74  59  71  78
3  98  56  37  78  84  82  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 42 17 37 31 62 66]
 [48 52 81 74 59 71 78]
 [98 56 37 78 84 82 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, let's aim for a balanced distribution of total value received by each agent. This can be approached by using methods like maximizing the minimum value or ensuring an even distribution of high-value items.

Let's analyze the table and perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High value on item 5 (98) and item 3 (39).
   - Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values on item 1 (42) and item 6 (66).
   - Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High values on item 2 (81) and item 6 (78).
   - Since item 6 is already taken, allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values on item 0 (98) and item 6 (90).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to achieve a balanced distribution:

5. **Remaining items: 1, 3, 4**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 52).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 37).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (value 84).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [3, 6]
- Agent 2: [1, 2]
- Agent 3: [0, 4]

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
