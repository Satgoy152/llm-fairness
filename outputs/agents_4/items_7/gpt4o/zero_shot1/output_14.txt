Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  93   0  45  55  92   0
1  40  90  89  83  66   0   0
2  94  28  91  40  69  89  89
3  73  83  28  85  14  50  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one common approach is to maximize the total value of items allocated to each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A possible allocation strategy can be as follows:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1: Value 93
   - Item 5: Value 92

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2: Value 89
   - Item 3: Value 83

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0: Value 94
   - Item 6: Value 89

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 4: Value 14

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total value allocated is reasonably balanced based on the agents' valuations. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [4]
}
```
