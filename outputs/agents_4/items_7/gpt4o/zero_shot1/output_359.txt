Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  11  42  38  97  31  26
1  39  35  72  25  21  39  98
2  68  11  64  86  66  75   9
3   6  13  18  39   0  67  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on the values they assign to the items. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3, 5, and 0.
- Agent 3 has a relatively low valuation for all items, with the highest being item 5.

To make a fair allocation, let's distribute the items as follows:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because they value it the most.
2. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 because they value it the most.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because they value it the most.
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 because they value it the most among their options.
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 because they have the second-highest valuation for it, and it helps balance their allocation.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because they have the highest valuation for it.
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because they have a relatively higher valuation for it compared to the other agents.

Based on these decisions, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are fairly distributed based on valuations.
