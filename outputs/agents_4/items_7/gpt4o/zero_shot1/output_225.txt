Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  54  24  15  37  87  33
1  59  74  21  58  57  47  79
2  65  33  39  47   1   2  88
3   6  19   2  31  69  76  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze the table to make the allocations:

```
Agent 0: 
- Values: 90, 54, 24, 15, 37, 87, 33

Agent 1: 
- Values: 59, 74, 21, 58, 57, 47, 79

Agent 2: 
- Values: 65, 33, 39, 47, 1, 2, 88

Agent 3:
- Values: 6, 19, 2, 31, 69, 76, 21
```

Let's allocate each item to the agent who has the highest valuation for it:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 90.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 74.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 39.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it second most at 58 (Agent 2 values it the most at 47 but has higher priority for item 6).
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most at 69.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 87.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 88.

Based on this analysis, here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent the items they value the most while ensuring that all items are distributed.
