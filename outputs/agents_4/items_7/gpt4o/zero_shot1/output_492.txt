Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  76   2  68  77  73  55
1  98   3  17  47  78  30  23
2  44  23  99  10  56  23  94
3  18  79  54  26  82  32  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This problem is similar to an assignment problem, where each item is assigned to one agent, and we try to optimize the allocation for maximum total utility.

Here's a step-by-step approach to find a fair allocation:

1. **List each agent's highest-valued items**: Start by identifying which items each agent values the most and try to allocate those items to them if possible.

2. **Avoid conflicts**: If multiple agents value the same item highly, decide based on the next highest item available for those agents or overall fairness.

3. **Maximize total value**: Attempt to maximize the total value across all agents, ensuring each agent gets a fair share relative to their valuations.

Let's analyze the matrix and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuations for items 1 (76) and 4 (77).
- Agent 1 values item 0 (98) and item 4 (78) the most.
- Agent 2 values item 2 (99) and item 6 (94) the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 4 (82) and item 1 (79) the most.

Now, let's allocate items:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 98) because it's the highest value for any agent.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 79) since that's the highest remaining value for that item.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 99) for their highest preference.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 68) since it's one of the highest remaining values for Agent 0.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 77) since Agent 0 values it highly, and Agent 1 got item 0 already.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (value 32) since they have fewer items allocated and value it more than others.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 94) as it's their second-highest preference.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
