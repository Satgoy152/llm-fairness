Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  76  76   4  99  78  20
1  37  63   7  65  13  64  34
2  49  90  17  93  21  57  56
3   8  12  83  67  72  41  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 76 76  4 99 78 20]
 [37 63  7 65 13 64 34]
 [49 90 17 93 21 57 56]
 [ 8 12 83 67 72 41 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that all 7 items are distributed among the 4 agents. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4. Allocating these items to Agent 0 gives them a total valuation of 83 + 76 + 99 = 258.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest value for item 3. Allocating item 3 to Agent 1 gives them a valuation of 65. We can also give Agent 1 item 5, which has a value of 64, bringing their total to 129.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 highly, but since it's already allocated to Agent 0, we can give Agent 2 items 2 and 6. This gives them a total valuation of 17 + 56 = 73.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 can receive item 4, which isn't allocated yet, and it has a valuation of 72 for Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their valuations, maximizing the overall satisfaction.
