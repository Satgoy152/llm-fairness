Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  10  20  83  19  42  46
1  25  50  14  52  29  40  98
2  17   9  82  87  20  65  81
3  56  58   9  40   5  79  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 10 20 83 19 42 46]
 [25 50 14 52 29 40 98]
 [17  9 82 87 20 65 81]
 [56 58  9 40  5 79 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation of items assigned to each agent, while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. Additionally, each agent should receive an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated should be exactly 7.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest value each agent places on them:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the highest at 97.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the highest at 50.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the highest at 82.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it highly at 87.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it at 29, which is higher than others.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 values it the highest at 79.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the highest at 98.

This allocation maximizes the values for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5]
}
```
