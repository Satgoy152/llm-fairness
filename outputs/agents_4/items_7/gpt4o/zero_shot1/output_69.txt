Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  18  11  46  75  79  41
1  72  53  21  45  33  30  41
2  98  56  13  53  90  73  45
3   6  61  22  98  77  20  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to consider the agents' valuations for the items to ensure a balanced distribution of value. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share of the total value according to their preferences. 

Let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 29 + 18 + 11 + 46 + 75 + 79 + 41 = 299
- Agent 1: 72 + 53 + 21 + 45 + 33 + 30 + 41 = 295
- Agent 2: 98 + 56 + 13 + 53 + 90 + 73 + 45 = 428
- Agent 3: 6 + 61 + 22 + 98 + 77 + 20 + 88 = 372

Next, we'll try to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share, taking into account their total valuations and preferences:

1. Agent 0 seems to value items 4, 5, and 3 the most, but since item 3 is highly valued by Agent 3, we'll give item 3 to Agent 3 and items 4 and 5 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 and item 1 highly, so we'll allocate these to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high value on item 0 too, but since it's already allocated, we can give them items 2 and 6.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3 and item 6, but with item 6 allocated, we'll just allocate item 3.

Let's finalize the allocations:

- Agent 0: [4, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [2, 6]
- Agent 3: [3]

Finally, we'll format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3]
}
```
