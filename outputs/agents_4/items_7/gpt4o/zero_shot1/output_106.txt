Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  28  94  48  19  95  65
1  59  11  49  60   8  27  37
2  45  55  89  19  66  71  12
3   5  29  21  65  42  67  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. We can achieve this by evaluating the value each agent assigns to each item and ensuring that each agent receives a balanced and fair share of total value. 

Here's a possible allocation method using a greedy algorithm approach, prioritizing giving each agent items they value highly until all items are distributed:

1. Agent 0:
   - Values: [2, 28, 94, 48, 19, 95, 65]
   - Select items with highest values: Item 5 (95), Item 2 (94)

2. Agent 1:
   - Values: [59, 11, 49, 60, 8, 27, 37]
   - Select items with highest values: Item 3 (60), Item 0 (59)

3. Agent 2:
   - Values: [45, 55, 89, 19, 66, 71, 12]
   - Select items with highest values: Item 6 (12), Item 4 (66)

4. Agent 3:
   - Values: [5, 29, 21, 65, 42, 67, 76]
   - Select items with highest value: Item 1 (29)

The allocations are made based on the highest available values for each agent until all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value relatively highly, and all 7 items are allocated.
