Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  45  45  52   2  93  64
1  59  11  86  34  76  75  67
2   8  50  48  55  75  46  55
3  22  24  63  35  20  57  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 5 45 45 52  2 93 64]
 [59 11 86 34 76 75 67]
 [ 8 50 48 55 75 46 55]
 [22 24 63 35 20 57 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can look at the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest, with a valuation of 93.
   - Next is item 6, valued at 64.
   - Then, item 3, valued at 52.
   - Total valuation: 93 + 64 + 52 = 209

2. Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest, with a valuation of 86.
   - Next is item 4, valued at 76.
   - Total valuation: 86 + 76 = 162

3. Agent 2:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest, with a valuation of 75. However, item 4 is already allocated to agent 1.
   - Next highest is item 1, valued at 50.
   - Then, item 3, valued at 55. However, item 3 is already allocated to agent 0.
   - Finally, item 2, valued at 48. However, item 2 is already allocated to agent 1.
   - Total valuation: 50

4. Agent 3:
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the highest, with a valuation of 63. However, item 2 is already allocated to agent 1.
   - Next is item 6, valued at 64.
   - Then, item 5, valued at 57. However, item 5 is already allocated to agent 0.
   - Total valuation: 64

Therefore, the allocations can be made as follows:

- Agent 0: [5, 6, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: []

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": []
}
```
