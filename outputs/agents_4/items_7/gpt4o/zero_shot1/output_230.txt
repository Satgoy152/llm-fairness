Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  36  42  93   1  98  92
1  53  75  97  93  85  76  51
2  46  91  55  31   8   6  69
3  31   2  29  49  44  15  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 36 42 93  1 98 92]
 [53 75 97 93 85 76 51]

 [31  2 29 49 44 15 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable allocation of items. Given the valuations provided, let's distribute the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, 5, and 6.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2, 3, 4, and 5.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 6.
4. Agent 3 has lower valuations across the board but could be given an item to ensure some fairness.

Let's start by assigning items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are allocated:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (84)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (93)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (91)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (69)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (98)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (97)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (44)

This allocation ensures that items are distributed while taking into account each agent's highest preferences, and all items are allocated.

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4]
}
```
