Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  10  17  70  37  38  92
1  16  54  28  70  25  74  16
2  58  22  74  22   7  97  72
3   6  16  86  97  26  53  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the total valuation or tries to balance the valuations across the agents. Here, I'll attempt to allocate items such that each agent's share is as fair as possible.

Let's consider each agent's highest valuation first, and allocate items to distribute the values fairly:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (92), Item 3 (70)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (74), Item 3 (70)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (97), Item 2 (74)
   - Item 5 is already allocated, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (97), Item 2 (86)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 0, 1, 4

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest valuation: Item 4 (37)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Next highest valuation: Item 0 (16)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Next highest valuation: Item 1 (22)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, all items are allocated. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
