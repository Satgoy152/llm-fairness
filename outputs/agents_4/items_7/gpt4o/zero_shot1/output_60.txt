Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  16  24  18  69  95  15
1  10  58  16  32  71  99  87
2  11  42  76  72  42  62  66
3  84  65  84  95  78  13  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that considers the preferences of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is for item 5 (95).
   - Next highest is item 4 (69).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value is for item 5 (99), but item 5 is already taken.
   - Next highest is item 6 (87).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value is for item 2 (76).
   - Next highest is item 3 (72).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value is for item 3 (95), but item 3 is already taken.
   - Next highest is item 0 (84).

Let's allocate the items based on the above considerations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [5, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Item [6]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 3]
- **Agent 3**: Items [0, 1]

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and takes into account the highest valuation for each agent as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
