Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  77  76  13  40  93  11
1   1  72  92   9  35  21  48
2  15  17  93  87  59  77  74
3  84  50  33   9  45  62   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. A common approach is to use a variant of the "maximum weight matching" in bipartite graphs, but given the requirement that each agent gets at least one item, we can approach the problem by assigning items based on maximizing individual agent values while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5 (value 93 for Agent 0). This is the highest value item for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2 (value 92 for Agent 1). This is the highest value item for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (value 87 for Agent 2). This is the highest value item for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 0 (value 84 for Agent 3). This is the highest value item for Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate 3 more items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

5. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (value 77 for Agent 0). This is the next highest value after item 5.
6. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 6 (value 74 for Agent 2). This is the next highest value after item 3.
7. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 4 (value 45 for Agent 3). This is the next highest value after item 0.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
