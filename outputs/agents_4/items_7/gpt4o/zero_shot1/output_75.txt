Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88   9  84  58  47  34  86
1  64  34  16  12  81  21  13
2  95  20   9  16  31  57  71
3  69  74  12   6   7  21  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness based on each agent's valuations. One common method to achieve this is using the "max-min fairness" approach, where we try to maximize the minimum value received by any agent. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 88 + 9 + 84 + 58 + 47 + 34 + 86 = 406
   - Agent 1: 64 + 34 + 16 + 12 + 81 + 21 + 13 = 241
   - Agent 2: 95 + 20 + 9 + 16 + 31 + 57 + 71 = 299
   - Agent 3: 69 + 74 + 12 + 6 + 7 + 21 + 42 = 231

2. **Allocate Highest Valued Items First:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (88), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (95), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (74), so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (81), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue Allocation with Remaining Items:**
   - Item 3: Highest remaining value is 58 for Agent 0, allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Highest remaining value is 57 for Agent 2, allocate to Agent 2.
   - Item 6: Highest remaining value is 86 for Agent 0, allocate to Agent 0.

After this allocation, the distribution is:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 3, 6
- Agent 1 gets item: 4
- Agent 2 gets items: 2, 5
- Agent 3 gets item: 1

4. **Validate Allocation:**
   - Total items allocated = 7 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
   - Each agent is considered.
   - Fairness based on high preferences is attempted within constraints.

**Final Allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```
