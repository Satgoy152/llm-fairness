Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  15  58  69  86  45  45
1  22  23  42  17   0  49  30
2  39   5  80  64  81  22  46
3  86  88  73  42  20  17   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One common approach in such problems is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with a fair share of the items. However, since we have 4 agents and 7 items, one agent will end up with only one item, while the others will have two items each.

Here's one way to approach this allocation problem:

1. For each item, identify the agent who values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent, ensuring that the final allocation satisfies the condition that all items are allocated.

Let's go through the list of items and allocate each one:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 86, the highest. Assign item 0 to agent 3.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it at 88, the highest. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 80, the highest. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 69, the highest. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 86, the highest. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 49, the highest. Assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 46, the highest. Assign item 6 to agent 2.

This allocation results in the following distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
