Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  23  41  27  79  25  33
1  81  28  84  53  35  49  75
2  43  93  98  30  19   5  98
3  35  97  77  60  57  90  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for each item. One approach to ensure fairness is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives by assigning each item to the agent who values it most. Here is a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing individual agent valuations:

1. **Item 0:**  
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 81.

2. **Item 1:**  
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 97.

3. **Item 2:**  
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 98.

4. **Item 3:**  
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 60.

5. **Item 4:**  
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 79.

6. **Item 5:**  
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 90.

7. **Item 6:**  
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 98.

Let's allocate the items accordingly, ensuring each agent is included even if they receive no items.

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all 7 items are allocated.
