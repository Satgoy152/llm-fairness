Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89   2  67  97  30  51  34
1  33  91  25  66  31  51  41
2  58   1  81   2  62  18  56
3   8  25  97   3  83  64  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 25 97  3 83 64 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is balanced or maximized according to their preferences. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (97). We can assign item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (91). We can assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (81). We can assign item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2 (97), but it's already assigned to agent 2. The next highest valuation for agent 3 is item 4 (83). We can assign item 4 to agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items 0, 5, and 6:

5. **Agent 0**: The highest remaining valuation for agent 0 is item 0 (89). We can assign item 0 to agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**: The next highest remaining valuation for agent 1 is item 5 (51). We can assign item 5 to agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**: The next highest remaining valuation for agent 2 is item 6 (56). We can assign item 6 to agent 2.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
