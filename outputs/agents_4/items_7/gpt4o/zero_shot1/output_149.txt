Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76   2  77  85  78   4  66
1  37   9   6  10  62  29  68
2  36  51  20  80  42  29  65
3  49  47  37  32  92  40  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items and try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is balanced, while also ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 has a moderate valuation for item 4 and 6.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4.

A possible allocation that tries to balance the total value received by each agent could be:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 76 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 51 for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 77 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 80 for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (value 92 for Agent 3).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 29 for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (value 68 for Agent 1).

This allocation tries to give each agent items they value relatively highly while ensuring fairness:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 5 and 6.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
