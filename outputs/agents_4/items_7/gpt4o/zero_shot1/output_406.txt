Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25   1  26  51  74  80  23
1  62  51  58  60   3  97  96
2  38  10  17  14  65  50  37
3  51  77  11  94  37  56  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a greedy approach. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring all items are allocated.

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items:**

   - Agent 0: 25 + 1 + 26 + 51 + 74 + 80 + 23 = 280
   - Agent 1: 62 + 51 + 58 + 60 + 3 + 97 + 96 = 427
   - Agent 2: 38 + 10 + 17 + 14 + 65 + 50 + 37 = 231
   - Agent 3: 51 + 77 + 11 + 94 + 37 + 56 + 63 = 389

2. **Sort the valuations for each agent to see which items are most valuable to them.**

3. **Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated:**

   - Assign the highest-valued items to each agent that doesn't overlap with others until all items are allocated.

4. **Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items [4, 5] (highest values 74 and 80)
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 6] (highest values 51 and 96)
   - Agent 2: Item [3] (highest value 14)
   - Agent 3: Items [0, 2] (highest values 51 and 11)

5. **Ensure all items are allocated and no duplicates:**

   After checking, all items from 0 to 6 are allocated uniquely.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair portion of items according to their valuations.
