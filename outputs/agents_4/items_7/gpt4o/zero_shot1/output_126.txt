Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  58  77  86   2  70  86
1  57  55  67  78  42  68  95
2  66  59  83  26   8  73  39
3  36   6  89  16   2   9   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider the valuations and attempt to distribute the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We have 4 agents (0, 1, 2, 3) and 7 items (0 through 6) to allocate.

Let's go through the process of distributing the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for agent 0 are 3 and 6, both with a value of 86. We'll allocate these two items to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for agent 1 is item 6, valued at 95, which is already taken by agent 0. The next highest value is item 3, valued at 78, which is also taken by agent 0. We will allocate the next available highest valued item, which is item 2, valued at 67, to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for agent 2 is item 2, valued at 83, which is already taken by agent 1. The next highest value is item 5, valued at 73. We will allocate item 5 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for agent 3 is item 2, valued at 89, which is already taken. The next highest values are items 0 and 1, valued at 36 and 6, respectively. We will allocate item 0 to agent 3.

Now we have allocated 5 items, leaving items 1 and 4 unallocated. We need to allocate these remaining items to ensure each agent gets a fair distribution:

5. **Further Allocation**:
   - Agent 2 can also have item 1, which has a valuation of 59, as it increases their total value significantly.
   - Agent 1 can take item 4, which they value at 42, providing them with a second item to match the allocation to agent 2 and agent 0.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
