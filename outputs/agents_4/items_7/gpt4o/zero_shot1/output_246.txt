Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  42  62  82  72   4  18
1  12  19   0  42  80  98  19
2  50   6  32  22  71   4   3
3  41  70  66  30  16  59  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4, 5.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively high valuation for item 4.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 1 and 2.

Let's allocate based on these observations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value: 89) and item 3 (value: 82) are assigned to agent 0 because they have the highest valuation among the agents for these items.
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 (value: 98) is assigned to agent 1 because they have the highest valuation for this item.
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value: 71) is assigned to agent 2 since no other agent values it as highly.
- **Agent 3**: Items 1 (value: 70) and 2 (value: 66) are assigned to agent 3 because they have the highest valuations among the agents for these items.
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (value: 15) is assigned to agent 3 as it is the least valued item left, and agent 3 can use it to balance their allocation.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while maximizing the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.
