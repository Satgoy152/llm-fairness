Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  70  43  58  70  82  74
1  90  11  40  41   9  54  16
2   3  72  78  67  93  63  52
3  92  92  22  52  56  41  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 70 43 58 70 82 74]
 [90 11 40 41  9 54 16]
 [ 3 72 78 67 93 63 52]
 [92 92 22 52 56 41 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, resulting in a total allocation of all 7 items.

Let's try to allocate items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation takes into account the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (82)
   - Allocation: [5]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (90)
   - Allocation: [0]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (93)
   - Allocation: [4]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (92)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (52) and Item 6 (50)
   - Allocation: [1, 3, 6]

Now, let's check if all items have been allocated and if the allocation is fair:

- **Agent 0** has item [5]
- **Agent 1** has item [0]
- **Agent 2** has item [4]
- **Agent 3** has items [1, 3, 6]

Remaining items to allocate: 2. Let's allocate them based on the remaining highest valuations:

1. **Agent 2**: 
   - Next highest valued item: Item 2 (78)
   - Allocation: [4, 2]

So, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [1, 3, 6]
}
```
