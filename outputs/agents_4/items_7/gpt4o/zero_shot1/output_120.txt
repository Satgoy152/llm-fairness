Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  21   4  56  66  90  10
1  47  50  73  66  42  23  83
2  51  87  89  34  19   2  94
3  21  98  17  14  90  20  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **List the items with their values for each agent:**

    - **Agent 0:** 46, 21, 4, 56, 66, 90, 10
    - **Agent 1:** 47, 50, 73, 66, 42, 23, 83
    - **Agent 2:** 51, 87, 89, 34, 19, 2, 94
    - **Agent 3:** 21, 98, 17, 14, 90, 20, 77

2. **Identify the highest value item for each agent:**

    - **Agent 0:** Item 5 (value 90)
    - **Agent 1:** Item 2 (value 73)
    - **Agent 2:** Item 6 (value 94)
    - **Agent 3:** Item 1 (value 98)

3. **Allocate items based on maximizing individual agent's value while ensuring no item is assigned more than once:**

    - **Agent 0:** The highest value item for Agent 0 is Item 5.
    - **Agent 1:** The highest value item for Agent 1 is Item 2.
    - **Agent 2:** The highest value item for Agent 2 is Item 6.
    - **Agent 3:** The highest value item for Agent 3 is Item 1.

4. **Allocate remaining items:**

    - Items 0, 3, and 4 are left to be allocated. We allocate these to further balance the distribution.
    - **Agent 0:** Allocate Item 4 (value 66), as it is the next highest value item available.
    - **Agent 1:** Allocate Item 0 (value 47), since Agent 1 has a decent valuation for it.
    - **Agent 3:** Allocate Item 3 (value 14), as it fills the allocation requirement.

5. **Verify allocations:**

    - Ensure no item is allocated more than once and all items are distributed.

6. **Finalize:**

Here's the allocation presented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents while maximizing the total value received by all agents.
