Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  31  36  44  16  96  86
1  24  32  58  83  81   9  85
2  95  89  82  55  27  73  85
3  46  16  62  16  43  84  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 32 58 83 81  9 85]
 [95 89 82 55 27 73 85]
 [46 16 62 16 43 84 63]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7. One possible approach to this problem is to consider the valuations and try to distribute items such that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is maximized while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's consider different allocations based on the table provided:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation on item 5 (96) and item 6 (86).
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations on item 3 (83) and item 2 (58).
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations on item 0 (95) and item 1 (89).
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation on item 5 (84) and item 2 (62).

A possible fair distribution could be:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (96), because it is their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (83), which is their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (95), their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (63), as it gives a decent value.

Now we have 3 more items (1, 2, 4) to be allocated. We can assign them based on maximizing the value for the agents who have not yet received a second item:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (89), increasing their total value.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (58), as it is a high value for them.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (43), as it gives them a reasonable second item.

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution while maximizing individual agent satisfaction. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [6, 4]
}
```
