Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58   8  82  71  90   9  86
1  99  18  89  14  80  73  42
2  67  36  32  31  32  57  33
3  88  46  74  11  64  81  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for the items each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the sum of valuations for each agent for all items.
2. Assign items to agents starting with the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with this approach:

### Calculating the Total Valuation for Each Agent:
- Agent 0: 58 + 8 + 82 + 71 + 90 + 9 + 86 = 404
- Agent 1: 99 + 18 + 89 + 14 + 80 + 73 + 42 = 415
- Agent 2: 67 + 36 + 32 + 31 + 32 + 57 + 33 = 288
- Agent 3: 88 + 46 + 74 + 11 + 64 + 81 + 41 = 405

### Assigning Items:
1. Start with the highest value each agent has for an item, and assign that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Continue assigning the next highest unallocated item to the agent who values it most, ensuring no agent receives more than necessary, given there are only 7 items.

### Allocation Steps:
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 99, which is the highest single-item valuation, so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 4 at 90, assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 0 values item 2 at 82, assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 3 values item 5 at 81, assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Agent 0 values item 6 at 86, assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Agent 0 values item 3 at 71, assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 3 values item 1 at 46, assign item 1 to Agent 3.

### Resulting Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items [2, 3, 4, 6]
- Agent 1 gets item [0]
- Agent 2 gets no items []
- Agent 3 gets items [1, 5]

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This is one possible allocation that respects the conditions given.
