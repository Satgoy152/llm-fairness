Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  92  65   7  69  79  70
1  78  97  41  98  39  41  82
2  95  79  73  29  93  81  78
3  67  23  40  76  58  79  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items when possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Allocate the item that each agent values the highest.
2. If conflicts arise (more than one agent wants the same item), allocate based on a tiebreaker, such as the next highest valued item or random selection if values are equal.
3. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent is considered for allocation.

Let's go through the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [7, 92, 65, 7, 69, 79, 70]
   - Highest value is for item 1 (92).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [78, 97, 41, 98, 39, 41, 82]
   - Highest value is for item 3 (98).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [95, 79, 73, 29, 93, 81, 78]
   - Highest value is for item 0 (95).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [67, 23, 40, 76, 58, 79, 85]
   - Highest value is for item 6 (85).

Now, let's resolve any conflicts and allocate remaining items:

- Items 1, 3, 0, and 6 are already allocated.
- Remaining items: [2, 4, 5].

Continuing the allocation to ensure fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest value for item 5 (79).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest value for item 4 (39).
- **Agent 2**: Next highest value for item 2 (73).

After resolving conflicts and allocating all items, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to one agent, and each agent is considered in the process.
