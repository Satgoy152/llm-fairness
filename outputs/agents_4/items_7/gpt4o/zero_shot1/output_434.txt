Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75   0  19  65  41  10  22
1  81  56  71  17  19  77  75
2   9  87  64  68  53  76  35
3  76  24  72   9  41  17  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [76 24 72  9 41 17 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is 75 for Item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is 81 for Item 0, but since Item 0 is already taken, we choose the next highest, which is 77 for Item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is 87 for Item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is 76 for Item 0, but since Item 0 is taken, we choose the next highest, which is 72 for Item 2.

Now, we have allocated Items 0, 1, 2, and 5. The remaining items are 3, 4, and 6. We continue by allocating these:

5. **Remaining for Agent 0**: The next highest value for Agent 0 is 65 for Item 3.
6. **Remaining for Agent 1**: The next highest value for Agent 1 is 75 for Item 6.
7. **Remaining for Agent 2**: The next highest value for Agent 2 is 53 for Item 4.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
