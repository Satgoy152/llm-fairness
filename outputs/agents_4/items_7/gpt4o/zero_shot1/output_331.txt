Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  59  88  76  53  29  33
1  46  23  76  76  49  77  63
2   6  25  86  71   4  12   4
3  96   0  47  88  93  85  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Assign the highest valued items to agents first**: We will start by assigning items based on the highest individual valuations to ensure each agent gets the most value possible.

2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item**: We try to distribute items such that each agent gets at least one item, promoting fairness.

3. **Reassess and reallocate if needed**: After initial allocation, if any agent ends up with no items, reassign from another agent where possible to ensure all agents are included.

The following allocation is one possible solution:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (88)
- Agent 1: Items 5 (77) and 6 (63)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (71)
- Agent 3: Items 0 (96), 4 (93), and 1 (0)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 4, 1]
}
```

This allocation is balanced in terms of the overall valuations for each agent, considering the constraints.
