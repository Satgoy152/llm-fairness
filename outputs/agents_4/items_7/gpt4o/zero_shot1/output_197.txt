Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  59  29  58  28  72   9
1  14   4  85  48   0  98  18
2  22  65  27  99   8  64  50
3  87  36  27  89  14  76  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14  4 85 48  0 98 18]
 [22 65 27 99  8 64 50]
 [87 36 27 89 14 76 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to give each agent at least one item while considering their valuations. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences. We can use a greedy approach to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 87 by agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 65 by agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 85 by agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 99 by agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 28 by agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 98 by agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 98 by agent 3.

Now we need to ensure each agent gets an item while keeping the total allocations to 7. We can adjust slightly for fairness:

- Agent 0: Gets item 4.
- Agent 1: Gets items 2 and 5.
- Agent 2: Gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 3: Gets items 0 and 6.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the highest valuations reasonably.
