Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  37  54  74  25  94  11
1   8   3  71  77   7  37  60
2  23  25  13  12  53  34  59
3  98  14  82  74  36  90  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim for a distribution that maximizes each agent’s total value from the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [4, 37, 54, 74, 25, 94, 11]
Agent 1: [8, 3, 71, 77, 7, 37, 60]
Agent 2: [23, 25, 13, 12, 53, 34, 59]
Agent 3: [98, 14, 82, 74, 36, 90, 89]
```

We aim to distribute these 7 items among 4 agents. One approach is to allocate the items in a way that gives each agent at least one item, while maximizing the total value each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value is for item 5 (94)
  
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value is for item 3 (77)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is for item 4 (53)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value is for item 0 (98)

Now, let's allocate remaining items:

- Items 1, 2, and 6 are left for allocation. Let’s distribute them based on remaining high values:

5. **Agent 3** (second allocation):
   - Item 6 (89) has a high value for Agent 3

6. **Agent 1** (second allocation):
   - Item 2 (71) has a high value for Agent 1

7. **Agent 0** (second allocation):
   - Item 1 (37) has a reasonable value for Agent 0 and balances the distribution

This distribution ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total value is relatively fair based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
