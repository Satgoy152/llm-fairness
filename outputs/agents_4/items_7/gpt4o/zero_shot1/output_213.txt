Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  45  61  49  89  73  69
1   9  19  73  47  62  29  36
2  11  25   1  55  21   3  35
3  96   3  92  67  34  93  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we will attempt to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their overall satisfaction based on their valuations. We will consider both the valuations and the need to distribute all items while ensuring no items are left unallocated.

Let's examine the values and try to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuation for item 4 (89), so item 4 is allocated to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 (73), so item 2 is allocated to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (55), so item 3 is allocated to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 0 (96), so item 0 is allocated to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 out of 7 items, with items 1, 5, and 6 remaining.

- **Item 5:** Agent 3 has the highest valuation (93), so item 5 is allocated to Agent 3.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 has a reasonable valuation (45), and since Agent 0 only has one item, item 1 is allocated to Agent 0.
- **Item 6:** Between Agent 0 (69) and Agent 3 (27), Agent 0 has a higher valuation, so item 6 is allocated to Agent 0.

Let's ensure this allocation is clear and follows the requirements:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items among the agents, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their valuations.
