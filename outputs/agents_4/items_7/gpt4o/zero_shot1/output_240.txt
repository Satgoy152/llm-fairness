Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86   0   3   5  52  27  86
1  56  66  47  54  19  42  56
2  86  36  31  20  95  14  94
3  14  45   4  54  48  69  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here's a step-by-step plan for a fair allocation:

1. **Assign High-Value Items:**
   - Start by assigning the most valuable item for each agent, if possible, to ensure each agent receives high-value items.

2. **Avoid Overlapping:**
   - If the most valuable items conflict (i.e., the same item is most valuable for multiple agents), choose the next best available item for one of those agents.

3. **Ensure All Receive Items:**
   - Ensure every agent gets at least one item, and adjust as necessary to distribute remaining items.

Let's walk through this process with the given valuation table:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 0 and 6 (value 86 each). Assign item 0.
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 1 (value 66). Assign item 1.
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 4 (value 95). Assign item 4.
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 5 (value 69). Assign item 5.

Each agent has received one item so far, and there are 3 items left to allocate (items 2, 3, and 6).

- **Remaining Items Allocation**:
  - **Agent 0**: Choose item 6 (value 86), as it is the highest remaining value for agent 0.
  - **Agent 1**: Choose item 3 (value 54), as it is the highest remaining value for agent 1.
  - **Agent 2**: Choose item 2 (value 31), as it is the highest remaining value for agent 2.

Agent 3 has already received the item with the highest value they can get (item 5).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total value is optimized for each agent based on their given valuations.
