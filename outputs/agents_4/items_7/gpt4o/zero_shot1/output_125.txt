Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  91  37  20  15  78  21
1  53  88  40  16  96  65   7
2  55  39  51  59  34  62  27
3  88  85  28  18  60  17  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will attempt to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. We can start by considering each agent's highest value items and making sure every agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (91), Item 5 (78)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (96), Item 1 (88)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (59), Item 5 (62)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (88), Item 1 (85)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, consider the remaining items (2, 5, 6) and distribute them:

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 2:
     - Highest value for Agent 2 (51)
     - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

   - Item 5:
     - Highest value for Agent 2 (62)
     - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2.

   - Item 6:
     - Highest value for Agent 0 (21)
     - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

The allocations are now complete, with each agent receiving an integer number of items and all items distributed.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
