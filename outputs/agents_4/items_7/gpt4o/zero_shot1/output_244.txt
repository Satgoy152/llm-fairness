Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  14  41  59  77  62  60
1  10  58  95  27  82  53  93
2   4  20  56  68  34  49  84
3  58  20  78  26  66  22   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 14 41 59 77 62 60]
 [10 58 95 27 82 53 93]
 [ 4 20 56 68 34 49 84]
 [58 20 78 26 66 22  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are assigned. Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each. Let's perform the allocation based on maximizing individual agent valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [6, 14, 41, 59, 77, 62, 60]
   - Highest value: 77 (item 4)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [10, 58, 95, 27, 82, 53, 93]
   - Highest value: 95 (item 2)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [4, 20, 56, 68, 34, 49, 84]
   - Highest value: 84 (item 6)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [58, 20, 78, 26, 66, 22, 6]
   - Highest value: 78 (item 2) - already taken by Agent 1
   - Next highest: 66 (item 4) - already taken by Agent 0
   - Next highest: 58 (item 0)

Now, let's assign the remaining items. Agent 0 has the next highest interest in item 5 following their highest interest item 4.

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Now has item 4 (77) and item 5 (62)

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 0

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0]
}
```
