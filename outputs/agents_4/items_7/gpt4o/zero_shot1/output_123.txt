Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  18  80  85  13  54  88
1  72  33  17  62  50  17  78
2  17  96  36   9  93  95  83
3  35  30  96  93  23  63  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (given that we have 4 agents and 7 items). Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item by Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: [17, 18, 80, 85, 13, 54, 88]
   - Agent 1: [72, 33, 17, 62, 50, 17, 78]
   - Agent 2: [17, 96, 36, 9, 93, 95, 83]
   - Agent 3: [35, 30, 96, 93, 23, 63, 50]

2. **Assign Each Item to the Agent Who Values It the Most**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (value = 72)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (value = 96)
   - Item 2: Agent 3 (value = 96)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (value = 85)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (value = 93)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (value = 95)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (value = 88)

3. **Ensure Fair Distribution**:
   - Check the current allocation:
     - Agent 0: [3, 6]
     - Agent 1: [0]
     - Agent 2: [1, 4, 5]
     - Agent 3: [2]

   - Since Agent 1 has only one item, we ensure that no agent has more than three items in this configuration.

4. **Finalize the Allocation**:
   - Ensure a fair distribution by checking the number of items each agent gets and the total number of items is 7.

Here's the final allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives an integer number of items, and a total of 7 items are allocated fairly among the agents.
