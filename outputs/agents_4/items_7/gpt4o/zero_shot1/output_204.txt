Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  53  81  10  13  34  92
1  77  58  98  55  15  57  79
2   6  19  27  36  99  70  75
3  51  23  52   2  73  49  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize total value across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, provided that this doesn't lead to any agent receiving more items than others in an unfair manner. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 54
   - Agent 1 values it at 77
   - Agent 2 values it at 6
   - Agent 3 values it at 51
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 53
   - Agent 1 values it at 58
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - Agent 3 values it at 23
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 81
   - Agent 1 values it at 98
   - Agent 2 values it at 27
   - Agent 3 values it at 52
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 10
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Agent 2 values it at 36
   - Agent 3 values it at 2
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 13
   - Agent 1 values it at 15
   - Agent 2 values it at 99
   - Agent 3 values it at 73
   - **Allocate to Agent 2**

6. **Item 5:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 34
   - Agent 1 values it at 57
   - Agent 2 values it at 70
   - Agent 3 values it at 49
   - **Allocate to Agent 2**

7. **Item 6:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 92
   - Agent 1 values it at 79
   - Agent 2 values it at 75
   - Agent 3 values it at 17
   - **Allocate to Agent 0**

Now, let's ensure that the allocation is fair and follows the rules:

- Agent 1 has received 4 items (0, 1, 2, 3), which is the maximum any single agent should receive to maintain fairness.
- Agent 2 has received 2 items (4, 5).
- Agent 0 has received 1 item (6).
- Agent 3 has received no items.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": []
}
```
