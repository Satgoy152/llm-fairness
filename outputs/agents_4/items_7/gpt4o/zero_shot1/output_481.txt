Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  66  81  58  36  63  23
1  58  26  56  48  73  70  32
2  97  30  54  17  38  18  64
3  97  58  52  57   6  65  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives a reasonable value from their allocated items. One common approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's go through the steps for this allocation:

1. **Determine initial allocations**: We start by giving each agent one item that they value most.
2. **Allocate remaining items**: Distribute the remaining items based on the highest valuation from the remaining agents, ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

- **Step 1**: Assign each agent their highest valued item:
  - Agent 0: Item 2 (value 81)
  - Agent 1: Item 4 (value 73)
  - Agent 2: Item 0 (value 97)
  - Agent 3: Item 0 (value 97) – Since this item is already taken, we assign the next highest value.

- **Step 2**: Continue assigning the remaining items based on highest valuations:
  - Agent 3: After item 0, the next highest is item 5 (value 65)
  - Remaining items: 1, 3, 6

- **Step 3**: Allocate remaining items considering highest remaining valuations:
  - Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (66)
  - Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (58)
  - Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (64)

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 6
- Agent 3: Item 5

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
