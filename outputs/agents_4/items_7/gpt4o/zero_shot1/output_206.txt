Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  66  93  74  62  45  86
1  25  64  81  36  30  97  83
2  36  10  41  91  44  16  68
3  78  62  81  57  33   1  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. One common approach to achieve this is by using a method like the "Greedy Algorithm". Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for agent 0 are items 2 (value 93) and item 6 (value 86). Assign items 2 and 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for agent 1 is item 5 (value 97). Assign item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for agent 2 is item 3 (value 91). Assign item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for agent 3 is item 0 (value 78). Assign item 0 to agent 3.

5. Now, we have allocated 5 items, and 2 items remain (1 and 4).

6. **Agent 2**: The next highest value for remaining items is item 4 (value 44) for agent 2. Assign item 4 to agent 2.

7. **Agent 1**: Assign the last remaining item 1 (value 64) to agent 1.

Now, all items have been allocated. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations while distributing all 7 items.
