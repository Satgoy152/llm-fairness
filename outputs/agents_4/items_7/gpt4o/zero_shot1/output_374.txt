Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  41  53  59  86  41  39
1  49  50  87  53  68  65  64
2   1  86  82  16  28  36  34
3  34  31  98  35  43   3  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[31 41 53 59 86 41 39]
 [49 50 87 53 68 65 64]
 [ 1 86 82 16 28 36 34]
 [34 31 98 35 43  3 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations, we can use a strategy that considers the highest individual value each agent has for an item, while also ensuring that no agent is left without an item. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent one by one until each agent has at least one item.
2. After each agent has at least one item, allocate the remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent.

Let's go through this process step by step:

- Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value = 98).
- Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value = 86).
- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value = 86).
- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value = 49).

Now, each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (3, 5, 6):

- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value = 53), maximizing agent 1's total value.
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value = 65), maximizing agent 1's total value further.
- Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value = 39), maximizing agent 0's total value.

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
