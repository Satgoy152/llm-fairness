Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  20  36  61  72  31  44
1  80  93  51  49  36  72  19
2  68   2  49  36  72  70   3
3  34  71  19  54  68  53  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to distribute items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. Here is one approach to do so:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
2. Agent 1 has high valuation for item 1.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5 and 4.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3 and 1.

We'll allocate the items by considering the highest valuations first, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 5 and 6
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
