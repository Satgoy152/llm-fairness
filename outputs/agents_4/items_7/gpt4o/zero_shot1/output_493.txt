Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  52  27  89  88  71  83
1  19   6  89  53  45  66  53
2  11  90  82  88  32  97  31
3   9   8  11  69  43  22  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives a fair number of items.

Let's go through the process step-by-step to determine an allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each agent and allocate those items, making sure no two agents compete for the same item unless necessary.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated, with a preference for maximizing individual agent valuations.

Looking at the table:

Agent 0:
- Highest valuations: Item 0 (90), Item 3 (89)
  
Agent 1:
- Highest valuation: Item 2 (89)

Agent 2:
- Highest valuation: Item 5 (97), Item 1 (90)

Agent 3:
- Highest valuation: Item 6 (81)

By allocating based on these high valuations, we can distribute the items fairly:

- Agent 0 takes Item 0 and Item 3.
- Agent 1 takes Item 2.
- Agent 2 takes Item 5 and Item 1.
- Agent 3 takes Item 6.

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated, and every agent has at least one item. We have already allocated 6 items. Item 4 remains unallocated.

Observing the remaining item (Item 4):

- Agent 0 would value it at 88, which is high compared to their other preferences.

Therefore, allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 to maximize overall satisfaction.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their preferences, maximizing their total valuation.
