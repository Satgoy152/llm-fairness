Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  57  33  76  23  90  78
1  98  32   4  41   9  36  98
2   2  99  86  71  30  72  12
3  38  53  96  37  91  42  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We must ensure that each agent gets a fair share of items, considering their valuations, and that all 7 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the agents' preferences based on their valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Preferences (from highest to lowest value): 5 (90), 3 (76), 6 (78), 1 (57), 2 (33), 4 (23), 0 (0)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Preferences: 0 (98), 6 (98), 3 (41), 5 (36), 1 (32), 4 (9), 2 (4)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Preferences: 1 (99), 2 (86), 5 (72), 3 (71), 4 (30), 6 (12), 0 (2)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Preferences: 2 (96), 4 (91), 1 (53), 3 (37), 5 (42), 0 (38), 6 (21)

To ensure fairness, we need to distribute items such that each agent gets a reasonable number of items while also considering their top preferences.

Here's one possible fair allocation:
- Assign items based on maximizing valuations for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated once.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: [5] (highest value for item 5)
- Agent 1: [0, 6] (highest value for items 0 and 6)
- Agent 2: [1, 3] (highest value for items 1 and 3)
- Agent 3: [2, 4] (highest value for items 2 and 4)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
