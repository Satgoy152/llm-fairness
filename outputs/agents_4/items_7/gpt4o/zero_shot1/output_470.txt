Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  45  28  44  23  35  18
1   6  54  39  17  85  31  75
2  99  44  53  35  30  14  68
3  49  92  60  97  32  59  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction of each agent for the items they receive. Here, we'll aim to allocate items based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (45), Item 3 (44)
   - Allocate: Item 1

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (85), Item 6 (75)
   - Allocate: Item 4

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 6 (68)
   - Allocate: Item 0

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (97), Item 1 (92)
   - Allocate: Item 3

Now, we review the remaining items: 2, 5, and 6. We will assign these items to agents who maximize their value in the remaining pool.

- **Remaining Item 2**: 
  - Highest remaining valuation: Agent 3 (60)
  - Allocate to Agent 3

- **Remaining Item 5**:
  - Highest remaining valuation: Agent 0 (35)
  - Allocate to Agent 0

- **Remaining Item 6**:
  - Highest remaining valuation: Agent 1 (75)
  - Allocate to Agent 1

The allocation is as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 3, 2

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```
