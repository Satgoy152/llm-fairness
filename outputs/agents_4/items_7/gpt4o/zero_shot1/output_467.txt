Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  35  55  43  15  21  80
1  64  73  57  55  91  54  53
2  35  58   5   3  21  30  82
3  81  22  56  26  31  79  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High Valuation Matches:** Start by identifying the highest valuations for each item across all agents. This helps in ensuring each item is allocated to an agent who values it the most.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Item 0: Agent 3 has the highest value (81).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 has the highest value (73).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest value (55).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest value (43).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 has the highest value (91).
   - Item 5: Agent 3 has the highest value (79).
   - Item 6: Agent 2 has the highest value (82).

3. **Consider Fairness and Redistribution:**
   - Ensure each agent receives a fair number of items. Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, each agent should ideally get either 1 or 2 items.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Adjust the allocation slightly to ensure fairness while maintaining relatively high valuations.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [6]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution is reasonably fair considering the agents' valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
