Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  20  76   3  51  59  22
1   6  12  63   9  99  62  44
2  12  71  88  74  54  15  44
3  62   5  22  83  97  94  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 20 76  3 51 59 22]
 [ 6 12 63  9 99 62 44]
 [12 71 88 74 54 15 44]
 [62  5 22 83 97 94 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Additionally, each agent should receive at least one item since there are 7 items and 4 agents. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Highest value items: 0 (91), 2 (76)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Highest value items: 4 (99), 5 (62)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Highest value items: 2 (88), 1 (71)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**  
   - Highest value items: 4 (97), 3 (83)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. Allocate remaining items based on next highest values:

   - **Item 1:**  
     - Highest value to Agent 2 (71)
   - **Item 5:**  
     - Highest value to Agent 3 (94)
   - **Item 6:**  
     - Highest value to Agent 1 (44)

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6
- Agent 2: Items 2, 1
- Agent 3: Items 3, 5

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
