Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  33  91  19  76  78   9
1  81  72  64  14  57  88  46
2  60  17  71  12  22  23  59
3  22  37  54  89  64  42  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74 33 91 19 76 78  9]
 [81 72 64 14 57 88 46]
 [60 17 71 12 22 23 59]
 [22 37 54 89 64 42 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the total allocation consists of all 7 items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value 74
   - Item 2: Value 91

   Total value for Agent 0 = 74 + 91 = 165

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 5: Value 88
   - Item 6: Value 46

   Total value for Agent 1 = 88 + 46 = 134

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 1: Value 17

   Total value for Agent 2 = 17

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 3: Value 89
   - Item 4: Value 64

   Total value for Agent 3 = 89 + 64 = 153

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, all items are allocated, and the overall valuation is maximized to the extent possible.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
