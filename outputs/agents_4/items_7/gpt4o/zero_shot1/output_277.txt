Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  43  82  78  82  77  47
1  72  30  86  70  24  27  79
2  37  60   6  56  28  22  95
3  49  69  36  68  85  68  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive one more item than the others.

Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. Agent 1 has high valuation for item 2, but item 0 is already a better fit for agent 0.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 6.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 4 and 1.

Based on these considerations, here's a reasonable allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, with a total of 7 items distributed.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
