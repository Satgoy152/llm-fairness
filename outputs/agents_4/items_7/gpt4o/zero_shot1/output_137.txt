Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  21  62  83  44  59  95
1  62  53  64  73  21  14  88
2  18  89  59  44  33  84  99
3  83  88  47  89  34  36  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets as close to an equal number of items as possible. Since there are 7 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but we'll try to distribute them fairly.

Let's begin by examining the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 0, 3, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 highly.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1 and 6.
4. **Agent 3** values items 0, 1, and 3 highly.

Based on these valuations, we can try the following allocation strategy:

- Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual preferences while attempting to distribute the items evenly.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (78), Item 3 (83)
   - Total value: 161
2. **Agent 1**: Item 6 (88)
   - Total value: 88
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 (89), Item 5 (84)
   - Total value: 173
4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 (47), Item 4 (34)
   - Total value: 81

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, and the distribution is done in a manner that tries to respect the agents' preferences.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation is fair in terms of distributing the items based on the agents' valuations and providing each agent with a significant portion of their highly valued items.
