Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  55  61  72  11   0  88
1  83  24   4  62  18  20  55
2  61  26  21  48  48  88  54
3  95  11  94  32  38  86  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 11 94 32 38 86 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider optimizing the allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it highly at 72.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1 as they value it highly at 83.
3. Assign item 5 to agent 2 since they value it highly at 88.
4. Assign item 2 to agent 3 because they value it highly at 94.
5. Assign item 6 to agent 0 since they value it highly at 88.
6. Assign item 1 to agent 1 as they value it at 24, which is reasonable.
7. Assign item 4 to agent 3 as they value it at 38, which is reasonable.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
