Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  67  33  83   9  41  57
1  16  42  95  35  19  12   1
2  13  39  29  49  62  18  99
3  58  63  38  30  36  70  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that balances the valuations each agent has for the items, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the total valuation or attempts to equalize the valuation received by each agent as much as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: 83 (item 3), 71 (item 0), 67 (item 1)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: 95 (item 2), 42 (item 1), 35 (item 3)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: 99 (item 6), 62 (item 4), 49 (item 3)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: 70 (item 5), 63 (item 1), 58 (item 0)

Now let's allocate the items based on these valuations, aiming to maximize each agent's total valuation:

- Assign item 2 (highest value 95) to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 (highest value 99) to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 (highest value 83) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 (highest value 70) to Agent 3.
- Assign item 1 (highest value 67) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 (highest value 71) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 (highest value 62) to Agent 2.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 3: Item [5]

These allocations ensure that each agent receives a fairly balanced distribution based on their valuations.

{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [5]
