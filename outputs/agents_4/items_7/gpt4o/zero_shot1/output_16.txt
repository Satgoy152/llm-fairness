Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  84  71  49  94  59   3
1  32  94  59  32  95  62  12
2  91  69  21  69  34  82  87
3  81   1  39  42  68  11  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. One common approach is to use an algorithm like the "Maximum Weighted Matching" in a bipartite graph or other similar allocation strategies. However, given the small size of the problem, we can manually inspect and assign the items to achieve a fair distribution.

Let's evaluate the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: High valuations on items 1 and 4.
- **Agent 1**: High valuations on items 1 and 4.
- **Agent 2**: High valuations on items 0 and 5.
- **Agent 3**: High valuations on items 0 and 6.

Based on the above valuations, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 84).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 95).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 82).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value 91).

Now, for the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 91).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 71).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 32).

This distribution ensures that each agent gets a fair share of high-valued items as per their preferences, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [6]
}
```
