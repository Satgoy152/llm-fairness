Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  77  82   2   8  23  79
1  92   7  73  71   1  69  27
2  68  86  13  56  82  20  37
3  77  71  29  28  41  55  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items combined.
2. Distribute the items based on the highest valuations to ensure fairness and efficiency.
3. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 1 and 6 to Agent 0 as they have high values for these items.
- Agent 1: Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 1 as they have very high values for these items.
- Agent 2: Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 2 as they have high values for these items.
- Agent 3: Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 as they have a decent value for it, and it balances the allocation.

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
