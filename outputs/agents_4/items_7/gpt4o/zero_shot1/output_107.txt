Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  89  81  98  75  11  65
1  12  65  10  20  32  95  17
2  23  92   1  71  80  25   7
3  64  41  14  17  78  25  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider both the values agents assign to items and ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible. We aim to maximize total valuations across all agents while distributing the items fairly.

Here's a fair allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. 
2. If any agent ends up with no items, reassign items from agents with multiple items, prioritizing agents with higher total valuations.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Highest value is 64 by Agent 3.
- Item 1: Highest value is 92 by Agent 2.
- Item 2: Highest value is 81 by Agent 0.
- Item 3: Highest value is 98 by Agent 0.
- Item 4: Highest value is 80 by Agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest value is 95 by Agent 1.
- Item 6: Highest value is 65 by Agent 0.

Initial assignments based on highest valuation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4
- Agent 3: Item 0

All agents have at least one item, and a total of 7 items have been allocated. This allocation satisfies the conditions.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
