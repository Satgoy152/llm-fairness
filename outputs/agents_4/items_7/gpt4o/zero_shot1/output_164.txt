Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  18  50  71  78  68  85
1  18  15  13   0   5   5  16
2  26   1  83  34  74  91  71
3  73  23  94  41  51  52  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we should consider both maximizing total valuation and ensuring each agent receives some items, if possible. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a balanced allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Matches**: Start by identifying the highest-valued items for each agent to ensure that they receive items they value the most.

2. **Balance Across Agents**: Ensure that each agent has at least some items, if possible, and avoid assigning all items to just one or two agents.

3. **Final Allocation**: Adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed, and each allocation is fair.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Valuations are high for items 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We will start by assigning them items they value highly.
- Agent 1: Values items 0, 1, and 6, but values are generally lower than others. Assign items not highly valued by others.
- Agent 2: Values item 2 highly and has a good valuation for items 5 and 6.
- Agent 3: Has the highest valuation for item 2 and values items 0, 3, and 4 considerably.

Considering the above, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Assign high-value items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1: Assign item 1, which is not highly valued by others.
- Agent 2: Assign highly valued item 2 and item 6.
- Agent 3: Assign items 3 and 4.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
