Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  24  54  86   2   9  53
1   7  98  18  83  49  37  90
2  78  55  55  53  67  90  34
3  35  22  14  99  15  24  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive. One way to approach this is by assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and that the distribution is as balanced as possible.

Let's look at each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives to make sure the distribution is reasonable:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 78 by agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 98 by agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 54 by agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 99 by agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 67 by agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 90 by agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 90 by agent 1.

Now, let's distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets a reasonable share:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4, 5
- Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and distributes the items fairly based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items to the agents while considering their highest valuations for fairness.
