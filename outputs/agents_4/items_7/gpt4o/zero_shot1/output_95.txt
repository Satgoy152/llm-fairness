Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  36  78  81  16  32  88
1  44   1  59  16  33  15   9
2  59  60  17  38  87  97  14
3  79  51  91  64  68  30   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44  1 59 16 33 15  9]
 [59 60 17 38 87 97 14]
 [79 51 91 64 68 30  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuation of the items. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (value 79)
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (value 60)
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (value 91)
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (value 81)
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (value 87)
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (value 97)
- Item 6: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (value 88)

Based on this analysis, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 6
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4, 5
- Agent 3: Items 0, 2

This allocation ensures that the number of items given to each agent is an integer and all 7 items are distributed.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 4, 5],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
