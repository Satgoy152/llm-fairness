Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20   4  13  13  57  57  23
1  94  68  44  65  84  54  15
2   4  52  54  71  27  86  68
3   1  10  91  68   4  39  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of their assigned items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: 4 (57), 5 (57)
   - Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (94), 4 (84)
   - Item 4 is already taken, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items: 5 (86), 3 (71)
   - Item 5 is already taken, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valued items: 2 (91), 3 (68)
   - Item 3 is already taken, so allocate item 2 to Agent 3

Now, we have the items 1 and 6 remaining:

- **Agent 1** can also take item 1 (68)
- **Agent 2** can take item 6 (68)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the values each agent receives according to their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.
