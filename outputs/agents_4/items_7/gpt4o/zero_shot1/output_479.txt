Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  35  12  25  79  27  64
1  63  64  10  30  50  51  95
2  35  68   8  30  28  59  91
3  99  54  77  69  79  34   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total value received by each agent is as fair as possible.

First, let's analyze the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [38, 35, 12, 25, 79, 27, 64]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [63, 64, 10, 30, 50, 51, 95]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [35, 68, 8, 30, 28, 59, 91]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [99, 54, 77, 69, 79, 34, 2]

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Allocate item 4 (value 79) and item 6 (value 64)
  
- **Agent 1:** 
  - Allocate item 1 (value 64) and item 5 (value 51)

- **Agent 2:** 
  - Allocate item 3 (value 30)

- **Agent 3:** 
  - Allocate item 0 (value 99) and item 2 (value 77)

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
