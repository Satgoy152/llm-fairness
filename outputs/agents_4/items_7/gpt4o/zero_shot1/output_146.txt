Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  86  91  65  41  98   3
1  99  44  11  94   6   0   8
2  82  22  83  12  82  61  57
3  70  43  31  24   7  44  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common method for achieving this is to use a greedy algorithm, where we iteratively assign the highest valued item to the agent who values it most, adjusting for already assigned items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value (99) is given by agent 1. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value (86) is given by agent 0. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value (91) is given by agent 0. Assign item 2 to agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value (94) is given by agent 1. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value (82) is given by agent 2. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value (98) is given by agent 0. Assign item 5 to agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: The highest value (78) is given by agent 3. Assign item 6 to agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, considering the highest valuations for each item.
