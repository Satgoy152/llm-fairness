Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5   0  69  40  27  81  70
1  54  32  78  43  59   8  82
2  90  90   2  46  97  47   3
3  42  15  81  74  44  71  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a distribution where each agent is satisfied with the items they receive, given their valuations. One strategy is to use a greedy method that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the items and assign them to agents based on their highest valuations:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 5
   - Agent 1 values it at 54
   - Agent 2 values it at 90
   - Agent 3 values it at 42
   - **Assign to Agent 2 (Value: 90)**

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 0
   - Agent 1 values it at 32
   - Agent 2 values it at 90
   - Agent 3 values it at 15
   - **Assign to Agent 2 (Value: 90)**

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 69
   - Agent 1 values it at 78
   - Agent 2 values it at 2
   - Agent 3 values it at 81
   - **Assign to Agent 3 (Value: 81)**

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 40
   - Agent 1 values it at 43
   - Agent 2 values it at 46
   - Agent 3 values it at 74
   - **Assign to Agent 3 (Value: 74)**

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 27
   - Agent 1 values it at 59
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   - Agent 3 values it at 44
   - **Assign to Agent 2 (Value: 97)**

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 81
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 47
   - Agent 3 values it at 71
   - **Assign to Agent 0 (Value: 81)**

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 70
   - Agent 1 values it at 82
   - Agent 2 values it at 3
   - Agent 3 values it at 30
   - **Assign to Agent 1 (Value: 82)**

After assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 1, 4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it most highly, and each agent receives at least one item.
