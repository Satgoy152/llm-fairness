Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  85  12  69  87  91  37
1  64  70   6  58  83  59  56
2  12  28  80  84  61  90  55
3  16  72  11  45  23  43  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution maximizes the total valuation for each individual agent. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 91). Let's allocate item 5 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 83). Let's allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 80). Let's allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 (value 72). Let's allocate item 1 to agent 3.

5. **Distribute remaining items:**
    - Remaining items: 0, 3, 6

6. **Remaining allocations:**
   - Item 0: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 64). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
   - Item 3: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 84). Allocate item 3 to agent 2.
   - Item 6: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 37). Allocate item 6 to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution maximizes the total valuation for each agent.
