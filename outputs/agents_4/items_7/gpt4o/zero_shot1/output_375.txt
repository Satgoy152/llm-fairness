Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  37  73  71  63  55   0
1  96  65  77  84  56  82  39
2  25  10  34  92   6  42  26
3  56  54  66   5  52  53  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations and the requirement to allocate all 7 items, let's distribute them as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Evaluate which items yield the highest total value for Agent 0 without exceeding a fair share.
   - Agent 0 values: [0, 37, 73, 71, 63, 55, 0]
   - Allocate items: 2, 3 (highest values without exceeding a fair share).

2. **Agent 1**: Evaluate which items yield the highest total value for Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values: [96, 65, 77, 84, 56, 82, 39]
   - Allocate items: 0, 5 (highest values for a fair share).

3. **Agent 2**: Evaluate which items yield the highest total value for Agent 2.
   - Agent 2 values: [25, 10, 34, 92, 6, 42, 26]
   - Allocate items: 3 (highest value for a fair share).

4. **Agent 3**: Evaluate which items yield the highest total value for Agent 3.
   - Agent 3 values: [56, 54, 66, 5, 52, 53, 54]
   - Allocate items: 1, 6 (highest values for a fair share).

After distributing the items, ensure all 7 items are allocated, and each agent has an integer number of items.

Here is the JSON formatted allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations while fulfilling the requirement of distributing all 7 items.
