Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  60   1  55  95  68  57
1  38  90  10  31  56  32  34
2  43   7   8  35  46  44  91
3  59  44  26  75  45  22  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 44 26 75 45 22 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share of items. We start by examining the highest valuations for each item and assign items to agents accordingly, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's begin by assigning items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Item 4** has the highest valuation by Agent 0 (95).
2. **Item 1** has the highest valuation by Agent 1 (90).
3. **Item 6** has the highest valuation by Agent 2 (91).
4. **Item 3** has the highest valuation by Agent 3 (75).
5. **Item 0** has the next highest valuation by Agent 0 (65).
6. **Item 5** can be given to Agent 0 (68), as they still have the highest remaining valuation for any unallocated item.
7. **Item 2** can be given to Agent 1 (10), as Agent 1 has more room for additional items compared to others.

Now, let's compile the allocations into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations.
