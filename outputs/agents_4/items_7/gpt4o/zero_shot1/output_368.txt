Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  88  26  89  70  64  24
1  80  17  40  90   1  77  34
2  26  50  40  15  76  78  31
3  10  64  36   6   8   6  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 88 26 89 70 64 24]
 [80 17 40 90  1 77 34]
 [26 50 40 15 76 78 31]
 [10 64 36  6  8  6 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least some items.

Let's review the valuations and attempt a reasonable allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (89), followed by item 1 (88).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (90), followed by item 0 (80).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (78), followed by item 4 (76).
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (87), followed by item 1 (64).

Let's proceed with the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Assign item 3 to Agent 1** (value 90) since it is the highest value for Agent 1 and significantly higher than other agents' valuations for this item.
2. **Assign item 5 to Agent 2** (value 78) since it is the highest value for Agent 2.
3. **Assign item 6 to Agent 3** (value 87) since it is the highest value for Agent 3.
4. **Assign item 1 to Agent 0** (value 88) since it is a high value for Agent 0 and the highest remaining.
5. **Assign item 4 to Agent 2** (value 76) as it's the second highest for Agent 2 and not highly valued by others.
6. **Assign item 0 to Agent 1** (value 80) since it's a high value for Agent 1 and the highest remaining.
7. **Assign item 2 to Agent 0** (value 26) since it's left and Agent 0 can have it.

Now, each agent has received some items, and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 0
- Agent 2: Items 5, 4
- Agent 3: Item 6

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [6]
}
```
