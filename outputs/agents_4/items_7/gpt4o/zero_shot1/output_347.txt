Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  66  66  32  20  18  66
1   1  48  61   4  98  59  17
2  44  60  57  18  17  12  51
3  31  29  45  22  17   7  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 66 66 32 20 18 66]
 [ 1 48 61  4 98 59 17]
 [44 60 57 18 17 12 51]
 [31 29 45 22 17  7 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items allocated to them. Let's consider each agent's preferences and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: 
   - Highest values are for items 0, 1, 2, and 6, all valued at 66 and 75 for item 0.
   
2. **Agent 1's Preferences**: 
   - Highest value is for item 4, valued at 98.
   - Item 2 is also highly valued at 61.

3. **Agent 2's Preferences**:
   - Highest values are for items 1 and 0, valued at 60 and 44 respectively.

4. **Agent 3's Preferences**:
   - Highest value is for item 6, valued at 67.

Considering these preferences, we can allocate items by selecting the highest valued items for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3, as it has the highest value for them.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for them.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their next highest valued item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it is their next highest valued item.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it is their next highest valued item.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
