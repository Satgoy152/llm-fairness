Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  98  85  95  79  19  23
1  35  63  25  61   0  59  54
2  35  48  50  50  53  76  84
3  34  11  74  34  91  68  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by the agents for each item. The goal is to allocate all 7 items in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction or fairness.

One approach is to use the "Maximum Weight Bipartite Matching" algorithm, which aims to maximize the total valuation. However, given the simplicity and constraints of this problem (only 7 items and 4 agents), we can manually determine an allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, 2, 3.
- Agent 1 values item 1 and item 3 moderately.
- Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for items 5 and 6.
- Agent 3 highly values item 4 and moderately values items 2 and 6.

A fair allocation could be:

1. Give agent 0 two of the highest-valued items.
2. Allocate items to other agents based on their high valuations and fairness considerations.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1 (high valuation).
- Agent 1 gets item 3 (moderate valuation).
- Agent 2 gets items 5 and 6 (high valuation).
- Agent 3 gets items 2 and 4 (high valuation).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly while distributing all items fairly amongst the agents. Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
