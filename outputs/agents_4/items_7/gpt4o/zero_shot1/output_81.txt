Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  43  38  77  38  13  66
1  37  64  63  87  82  64  47
2  54  16  40  53  23  73  51
3  85   2  48  63  83  96  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and each item is assigned to exactly one agent. 

Let's consider the given valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  43  38  77  38  13  66
1  37  64  63  87  82  64  47
2  54  16  40  53  23  73  51
3  85   2  48  63  83  96  44
```

We'll allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's individual total valuation. One way to achieve a reasonable allocation is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no two agents get the same item. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most (85).
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most (64).
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most (63).
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most (87).
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most (83).
6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most (96).
7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most (66).

To ensure every agent gets a fair chance and items are distributed, we need to adjust the allocation a bit to ensure Agent 2 gets at least one item, given the constraints.

Let's update the allocation to give Agent 2 an item and balance the distribution:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
