Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  25  58  42  34  70  95
1  93  13  18   5  90   3  74
2   5  64  76  68  54  19  50
3  60  81  19  60  23  26  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we will aim to assign items such that each agent receives items they value relatively highly compared to others. We'll consider distributing the total of 7 items in a way that tries to maximize total satisfaction across all agents.

Let's examine the highest valuations for each agent and try to allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest-valued items are 6 (95), 0 (87), and 5 (70).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest-valued items are 0 (93), 4 (90), and 6 (74).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest-valued items are 2 (76), 1 (64), and 3 (68).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest-valued items are 1 (81), 0 (60), and 3 (60).

Considering these preferences, we will make allocations as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 5. (Values: 87, 70)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4. (Value: 90)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 2 and 3. (Values: 76, 68)
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 1 and 6. (Values: 81, 38)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
