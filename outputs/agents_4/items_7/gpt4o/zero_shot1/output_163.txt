Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  52  25  93  24  17   1
1  35   9  84   9  16  51  67
2  50  50  61  62  38  81   6
3  17  23  45  35  22  16  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction or efficiency. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for a particular item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the given matrix and assign items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (93)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (84)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (81)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (45), but this is already assigned to Agent 1, so next is Item 3 (35).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items considering the next highest values:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 2 (50) has the highest remaining value.

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 (52) has the highest remaining value.

- Item 4:
  - Agent 2 (38) has the highest remaining value.

- Item 6:
  - Agent 1 (67) has the highest remaining value.

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 5, 4],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations while distributing all items.
