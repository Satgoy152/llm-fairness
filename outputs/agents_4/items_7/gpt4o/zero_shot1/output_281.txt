Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  70  23  70  64  91  37
1  13  56  84  55  11  82  23
2   2  76   9  44  23  17  18
3  15  40  74  49  70  84   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41 70 23 70 64 91 37]
 [13 56 84 55 11 82 23]
 [ 2 76  9 44 23 17 18]
 [15 40 74 49 70 84  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can use a simple greedy strategy for this problem:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Verify that all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the allocations:

- Item 0: Highest value is 41 (Agent 0)
- Item 1: Highest value is 76 (Agent 2)
- Item 2: Highest value is 84 (Agent 1)
- Item 3: Highest value is 70 (Agent 0)
- Item 4: Highest value is 70 (Agent 3)
- Item 5: Highest value is 91 (Agent 0)
- Item 6: Highest value is 37 (Agent 0)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and make adjustments if needed:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 4

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
