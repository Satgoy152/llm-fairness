Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  44  13  90  50  61  47
1  34  53  46   3  37  97  73
2  78  22  30  59  82  46  78
3  80  60   7  78  30  13  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives a whole number of items, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each item is only allocated once.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is 80 by Agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is 60 by Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 46 by Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 90 by Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 82 by Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is 97 by Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is 78 by Agent 2.

Given these allocations, each item is given to the agent who values it the most. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
