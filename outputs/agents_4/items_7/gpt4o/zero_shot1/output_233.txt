Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47   0  31   0  38   8  42
1  97  28  88  63  94  66   3
2  57  30  32  15  76  38  81
3  56  93  38  34  63  22  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 28 88 63 94 66  3]
 [57 30 32 15 76 38 81]
 [56 93 38 34 63 22 96]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We also need to ensure that each item is assigned to only one agent, and all items are allocated.

Let's look at the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47   0  31   0  38   8  42
1  97  28  88  63  94  66   3
2  57  30  32  15  76  38  81
3  56  93  38  34  63  22  96
```

A potential allocation strategy is to assign items based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the available items, considering the constraint that each agent should get at least one item where possible, and all items must be allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuation for item 0, 2, and 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuation for item 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 3 has high valuation for item 1 and 6.

Let's assign items to agents:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items 1, 2, 3, and 5.

This ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes overall valuations based on the given constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
