Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  23  41   0  62  43  29
1  90  56  51  62  23  64  90
2  49  79  16  80  24  32  72
3  11  26  26  97  54  39  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0: 33
  - Agent 1: 90
  - Agent 2: 49
  - Agent 3: 11

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 23
  - Agent 1: 56
  - Agent 2: 79
  - Agent 3: 26

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 41
  - Agent 1: 51
  - Agent 2: 16
  - Agent 3: 26

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 0
  - Agent 1: 62
  - Agent 2: 80
  - Agent 3: 97

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0: 62
  - Agent 1: 23
  - Agent 2: 24
  - Agent 3: 54

- Item 5:
  - Agent 0: 43
  - Agent 1: 64
  - Agent 2: 32
  - Agent 3: 39

- Item 6:
  - Agent 0: 29
  - Agent 1: 90
  - Agent 2: 72
  - Agent 3: 32

Now, let's allocate the items by giving preference to the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (90).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (79).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (51).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (97).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (62).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (64).
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (90).

Let's check the allocations and adjust to ensure all agents receive items and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 5, 6
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 3

This distribution ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
