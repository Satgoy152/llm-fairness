Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  98  31  52  87  38  42
1  56  26  98  78  14  28  93
2  15   7  41  67  91  36  56
3  36  56  42  89  68  62  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given the table of valuations, we can approach this problem using a strategy that maximizes the utility for each agent.

Let's start by allocating the items to agents based on the highest value for each item.

1. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 1 (56).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (98).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 (98).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 3 (89).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 2 (91).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 3 (62).
7. Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 1 (93).

Now, we'll distribute these allocations while ensuring all agents receive at least one item if possible and adjusting as necessary to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: Highest value item is 1
- Agent 1: Highest value item is 2
- Agent 2: Highest value item is 4
- Agent 3: Highest value item is 3

Given that Agent 1 has two items (0 and 6), let's adjust to ensure all receive at least one:

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 to balance the number of items allocated.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 4 and 6
- Agent 3: Items 0, 3, and 5

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and distributes the items fairly based on their highest valuations.
