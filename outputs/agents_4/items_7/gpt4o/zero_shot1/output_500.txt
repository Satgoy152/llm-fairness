Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  73  43   6  11  40  69
1  18   9  10   0  32   0  40
2   6  55  32  11   2  16  94
3  54  12  37  66  95  85  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 73 43  6 11 40 69]
 [18  9 10  0 32  0 40]
 [ 6 55 32 11  2 16 94]
 [54 12 37 66 95 85 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction of all agents. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest available valuation.

Let's look at the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [90, 73, 43, 6, 11, 40, 69]
Agent 1: [18, 9, 10, 0, 32, 0, 40]
Agent 2: [6, 55, 32, 11, 2, 16, 94]
Agent 3: [54, 12, 37, 66, 95, 85, 50]
```

I'll allocate the items as follows:

1. Item 0 has the highest valuation from Agent 0.
2. Item 1 has the highest valuation from Agent 0.
3. Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 0.
4. Item 3 has the highest valuation from Agent 3.
5. Item 4 has the highest valuation from Agent 3.
6. Item 5 has the highest valuation from Agent 3.
7. Item 6 has the highest valuation from Agent 2.

After these allocations, we have:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets items 3, 4, and 5.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
