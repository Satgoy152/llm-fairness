Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  61  72  47  74  91  14
1  30  14  41  95  88   4  44
2  98  60  64  25  25  80  74
3  60  63  39  89  29  68  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 61 72 47 74 91 14]
 [30 14 41 95 88  4 44]
 [98 60 64 25 25 80 74]
 [60 63 39 89 29 68 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach, such as maximizing each agent's total valuation from the items they receive. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Select items that Agent 0 values highly.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (91). Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Next highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 (75). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Select items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (95). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Next highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 (88). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Select items that Agent 2 values highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest, but it's already taken. Next is item 5 (80), but it's already allocated. The next highest value is item 6 (74). Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
   - Next highest available item for Agent 2 is item 2 (64). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Select items that Agent 3 values highly.
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the highest, but it's already allocated. Next is item 6 (76), but it's already taken. The next highest available item is item 1 (63). Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly and that all items are allocated among the agents.
