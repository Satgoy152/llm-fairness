Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  58  50  80  67  99  35
1  10  50  48  82   2  66  94
2  33  33  33  25  77   2  25
3  64  54  39  48  48   5  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to balance the total value each agent receives. One way to do this is to try to maximize the minimum value that any agent receives, ensuring a fair distribution of items.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations and allocating items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 3, 5, and 6.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 4.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4.

Considering these preferences, let's try to distribute the items:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest value of 99).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value of 94).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value of 77).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value of 64).

Now, assign the remaining items:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value of 50).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value of 82).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value of 54).

This allocation distributes the items fairly considering the valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation considers the highest values for each agent.
