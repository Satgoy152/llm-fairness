Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  73  40  99  68  45  16
1   7  88  41  40  81  15  84
2  97   8  48   2  86   7  25
3  38  19  98  63  21  17   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 73 40 99 68 45 16]
 [ 7 88 41 40 81 15 84]
 [97  8 48  2 86  7 25]
 [38 19 98 63 21 17  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. There are various ways to approach this, but we will try to allocate the items in a manner that ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes their respective utility based on the given valuations.

Let's analyze the table and make a decision based on maximizing the value for each agent:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 (99) and 1 (73).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 (88) the highest.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 (97) the highest.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 (98) the highest.

We will attempt to allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 1 (values: 99, 73)
- Agent 1: Items 4 and 6 (values: 81, 84)
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 5 (values: 97, 7)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (value: 98)

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their total valuation based on their preferences.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```
