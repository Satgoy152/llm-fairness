Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  75  71  33   2  46  26
1  81  68  88  59  83  70  39
2  11  46  90  92  49  97  53
3  14  76  91  30  15  19  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. We'll consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate them accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 (value 84). We allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 88). We allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 5 (value 97). We allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 6 (value 92). We allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, four items are allocated. We still need to allocate three more items. We can look for the next highest available values for each agent:

5. **Agent 2**: The second-highest value for Agent 2 is item 3 (value 92). We allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 1**: The second-highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 (value 83). We allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 3**: The second-highest value for Agent 3 is item 1 (value 76). We allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures a fair distribution of items based on each agent's valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [6, 1]
}
```
