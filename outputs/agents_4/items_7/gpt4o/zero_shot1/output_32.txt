Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  16  98  49  30  83  73
1  88  89  81  41  23  92  67
2  98  23  87  41  78  13  75
3  43  58  68  67  40  40  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one way to approach it using a greedy algorithm:

1. First, assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's see how this works for the given valuations:

- Item 0: Highest value by agent 2 (98)
- Item 1: Highest value by agent 1 (89)
- Item 2: Highest value by agent 0 (98)
- Item 3: Highest value by agent 0 (49)
- Item 4: Highest value by agent 2 (78)
- Item 5: Highest value by agent 1 (92)
- Item 6: Highest value by agent 0 (73)

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most. Now, let's check if each agent has at least one item. If any agent doesn't have an item, we would need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness.

In this case, the allocation seems fair as each agent will end up with at least one item if we make some adjustments based on maximizing total value:

1. Reassign item 3 to agent 3 (value 67) from agent 0 to ensure agent 3 gets at least one item.

Here's the adjusted allocation:

- Item 0: Assign to agent 2
- Item 1: Assign to agent 1
- Item 2: Assign to agent 0
- Item 3: Assign to agent 3
- Item 4: Assign to agent 2
- Item 5: Assign to agent 1
- Item 6: Assign to agent 0

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
