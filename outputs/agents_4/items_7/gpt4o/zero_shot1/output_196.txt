Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  55  44   5  66  62  36
1  75  25  54  19  53  65  93
2  27  59  59  58  17  13  66
3  66  93  91  83  97  57  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This is a simplified approach to the fair division problem, aiming to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations.

We will use the following strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure fairness and that all items are assigned.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 2 since agent 2 values it highly and has no other highly valued items.
2. Assign item 6 to agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
3. Assign item 4 to agent 3, as it is their highest-valued item.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 0, balancing the remaining unallocated items.
5. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as it is the next highest-valued unallocated item for them.
6. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as it is a reasonable next choice for balancing.
7. Assign item 2 to agent 3, as it is another high-value item for them.

The resulting allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 6.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 4.

This distribution ensures all items are allocated fairly based on the given valuations.
