Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  47  74  69  66  54  89
1  47  70  37  14  19  38  39
2  97   7  82  40  38  61  71
3  86  82  21   8  29  57  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that exactly 7 items are allocated in total.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent**: First, we compute the sum of values for each agent if they received all items. This helps us understand which agents have higher overall valuation and might benefit from receiving more items.

2. **Consider Each Agent's Highest Valued Items**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each item is allocated only once.

3. **Ensure Fairness and Completeness**: Distribute the remaining items to ensure all 7 items are allocated, while maintaining a balanced distribution of value among agents.

4. **Adjust and Finalize**: Make adjustments if necessary to ensure no agent is left without items unless unavoidable, and that all items are allocated.

Following this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 6.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 6, but given Agent 0's higher valuation of item 6, we prioritize other items.
- Agent 3 has relatively high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.

After considering these factors, a fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 5 and 6.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations and ensures all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3]
}
```
