Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  12  77  45  25  51  37
1   1  69  85  47  86   1  59
2  46  61  44  87  56  10  14
3  76  20  28  30  32   0  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 12 77 45 25 51 37]
 [ 1 69 85 47 86  1 59]
 [46 61 44 87 56 10 14]
 [76 20 28 30 32  0 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim for a distribution that maximizes the total satisfaction across all agents. Here is a possible allocation that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 3, as they value it highly at 76.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as they value it highly at 69.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they value it the highest at 85.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as they value it highly at 87.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as they value it highly at 86.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as they have a relatively high value for it at 51.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0, as they value it at 37, which is decent relative to other agents.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution based on their preferences and maximizes the total perceived value.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
