Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  22  61  12  23  70  61
1  17  45  11  66   2  70  99
2  85  10  38  66  38  90  97
3  21  28  87  43  15   9  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item across all agents:**

    - Item 0: Highest value is 85 by agent 2.
    - Item 1: Highest value is 45 by agent 1.
    - Item 2: Highest value is 87 by agent 3.
    - Item 3: Highest value is 66 (shared by agents 1 and 2).
    - Item 4: Highest value is 38 (shared by agents 2).
    - Item 5: Highest value is 90 by agent 2.
    - Item 6: Highest value is 99 by agent 1.

2. **Assign items based on the highest value and attempt to balance the number of items each agent receives:**

   - Agent 2 has the highest value for items 0 and 5.
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for items 1 and 6.
   - Agent 3 has the highest value for item 2.
   - The remaining item (item 3) is a tie in value between agents 1 and 2. To balance the allocation, we can decide based on the current allocation or slightly shift priorities.

3. **Distribute items to ensure fairness in the number of items each agent receives:**

   - Agent 0 currently has no assigned items.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 6.
   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 5.
   - Agent 3 receives item 2.
   - To balance, we can assign item 4 to Agent 0.

4. **Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated:**

   - Agent 0: [4]
   - Agent 1: [1, 3, 6]
   - Agent 2: [0, 5]
   - Agent 3: [2]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations and that all items are allocated.
