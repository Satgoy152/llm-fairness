Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  81  55  20  27  49  87
1  27  26  92  86  71  54   7
2  37  39  73  73  87  90   7
3  33   9  24  94  15  33  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33  9 24 94 15 33 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We will try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, as much as possible, while also considering the values they place on the items.

Here's one way to approach this:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent, ensuring no item is double-assigned.
2. Continue assigning remaining items to agents who have the highest relative value for them until all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (value 87), so assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (value 92), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (value 90), so assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (value 94), so assign item 3 to agent 3.

Now, assign the remaining items (0, 1, 4) to agents, considering their highest remaining valuations:

- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 2 (value 87), so assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 81), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 2 (value 37), so assign item 0 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to fairly distribute items based on the agents' valuations.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
