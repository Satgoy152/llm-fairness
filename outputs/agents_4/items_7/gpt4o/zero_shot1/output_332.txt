Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  17  43  12  94  93  50
1  26  23  69  93  54  89  35
2   5  46  16  92  64  55  58
3  98  44   0  79  41  54  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88 17 43 12 94 93 50]
 [26 23 69 93 54 89 35]
 [ 5 46 16 92 64 55 58]
 [98 44  0 79 41 54 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 4 agents and 7 items, some agents will get more items than others. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Determine the highest value for each item among the agents.
2. Allocate items based on the highest value an agent assigns to them, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the table:

- Item 0: Highest value is 98 (Agent 3)
- Item 1: Highest value is 46 (Agent 2)
- Item 2: Highest value is 69 (Agent 1)
- Item 3: Highest value is 93 (Agent 1)
- Item 4: Highest value is 94 (Agent 0)
- Item 5: Highest value is 93 (Agent 0)
- Item 6: Highest value is 79 (Agent 3)

Given this analysis, a possible fair allocation could be:
- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 0, 6

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
