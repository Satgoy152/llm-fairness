Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  50   7  23  85  15  73
1   9  86  65  56  37  53  12
2  51  14  25  42  13  22  84
3  40  76  86  19   7  65  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider the valuations that each agent has for the items and try to assign items such that overall satisfaction (or value) is maximized while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's approach this by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations that have not yet been allocated, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and all items are allocated.

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4, 6, and 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 5.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 6, 0, and 3.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 2, 1, and 5.

Let's proceed with a greedy approach:

- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (highest value for agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (highest value for agent 1 that is not allocated).
- Assign item 6 to agent 2 (highest value for agent 2 that is not allocated).
- Assign item 2 to agent 3 (highest value for agent 3 that is not allocated).

Now, all agents have been assigned one item each, and we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate 3 more items.

- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (next highest value for agent 0).
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 (next highest value for agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (next highest value for agent 2).

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```
