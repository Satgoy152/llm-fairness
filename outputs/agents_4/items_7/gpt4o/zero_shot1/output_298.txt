Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  66  85  61  36  67  49
1  49  59  71  25  36  92  92
2  38  68   2  89  47  61  53
3  50  83  33  71  41  37  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 66 85 61 36 67 49]
 [49 59 71 25 36 92 92]
 [38 68  2 89 47 61 53]
 [50 83 33 71 41 37 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we want to maximize the total satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a method similar to the assignment problem, which can be solved using algorithms like the Hungarian method. However, given the small size of this problem, we can also solve it by inspection and balancing the allocations.

Here's a fair allocation strategy considering both fairness and total valuation:

1. Agent 0: Item 2 (85) and Item 0 (65)
2. Agent 1: Item 5 (92) and Item 6 (92)
3. Agent 2: Item 3 (89)
4. Agent 3: Item 1 (83) and Item 4 (41)

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of the items based on their valuations, while no agent is left without an item.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
