Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  21  32  62  76  94  20
1  95  85  33   2  13  77  94
2  23  12  36  93  75  88  43
3  83  86  89  17  11  65  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider using a method that tries to balance the total valuation each agent gets from the items they receive. One approach is to assign items in a way that maximizes fairness, which can be determined by ensuring each agent receives items with values that are as close as possible to their fair share, given the total value of all items.

Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the total value of all items:  
   Total value = 41 + 21 + 32 + 62 + 76 + 94 + 20 + 95 + 85 + 33 + 2 + 13 + 77 + 94 + 23 + 12 + 36 + 93 + 75 + 88 + 43 + 83 + 86 + 89 + 17 + 11 + 65 + 66 = 1577

2. Calculate the fair share for each agent:  
   Fair share per agent = Total value / Number of agents = 1577 / 4 â‰ˆ 394.25

3. Allocate items to agents by trying to get each as close to their fair share as possible:

- Assign items to Agent 0:
  - Assign item 5 (value 94)
  - Assign item 4 (value 76)
  - Assign item 3 (value 62)
  - Total for Agent 0: 94 + 76 + 62 = 232

- Assign items to Agent 1:
  - Assign item 0 (value 95)
  - Assign item 6 (value 94)
  - Total for Agent 1: 95 + 94 = 189

- Assign items to Agent 2:
  - Assign item 2 (value 36)
  - Assign item 1 (value 12)
  - Assign item 3 (value 93)
  - Total for Agent 2: 36 + 12 + 93 = 141

- Assign items to Agent 3:
  - Assign item 1 (value 86)
  - Assign item 2 (value 89)
  - Total for Agent 3: 86 + 89 = 175

This allocation tries to balance the total value each agent gets while considering each agent's specific valuations.

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": []
}
```

Note: The allocation process may require adjustments to ensure that each agent's value is as close as possible to their fair share while also considering constraints like integer allocation and total item allocation.
