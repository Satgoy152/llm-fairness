Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  52   3  56  19  75  73
1  15  65  37  72  91  42  99
2  17  76  10  35  38  88  61
3  51  48  93  34   4  26  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 52  3 56 19 75 73]
 [15 65 37 72 91 42 99]
 [17 76 10 35 38 88 61]
 [51 48 93 34  4 26 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation for all agents while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's an approach to achieve this:

1. First, let's assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. After that, we'll assign the remaining items to maximize the total valuation.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 5 (75).
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 6 (99).
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 5 (88). However, item 5 is already taken by Agent 0, so we look at the next highest valuation for Agent 2, which is item 1 (76).
- Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 2 (93).

Now we assign the remaining items (0, 3, 4) to maximize total valuation:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 3 (51).
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 1 (72).
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 1 (91). 

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6, 3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, all items are allocated, and the total valuation is maximized.
