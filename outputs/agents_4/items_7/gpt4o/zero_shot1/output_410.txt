Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  79   3  50  67  68  27
1   7  36  61  23  86  43  55
2  46  70  98   9  37   9  49
3  40  75  33  21  76  10  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use strategies like maximizing the total valuation for each agent or trying to match each agent with the items they value most. Given that there are 7 items and 4 agents, each agent will not necessarily receive the same number of items, but we will aim to distribute them as evenly as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: 24, 79, 3, 50, 67, 68, 27
   - Highest values: 79 (item 1), 68 (item 5)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: 7, 36, 61, 23, 86, 43, 55
   - Highest values: 86 (item 4), 61 (item 2)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: 46, 70, 98, 9, 37, 9, 49
   - Highest values: 98 (item 2), 70 (item 1)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: 40, 75, 33, 21, 76, 10, 63
   - Highest values: 76 (item 4), 75 (item 1)

**Allocation Strategy**:
- Start by assigning the highest-valued items that do not conflict with others.
- Try to ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

**Allocations**:
- Agent 0: Item 1 (value 79)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (value 86)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (value 98)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value 21)

Now, distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest values while ensuring the total number of allocated items is 7:

- Remaining items: 0, 5, 6
- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 68)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (value 55)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (value 46)

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated items in a manner that attempts to balance their valuations and the total number of items distributed is 7.
