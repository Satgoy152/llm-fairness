Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  97  79  86  27  23  35
1   8  38  76  40  62  11  51
2   7  70  27  19  60  90   7
3  88  55  57  82  15  54  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We want to distribute the items such that the total value perceived by the agents is maximized, and each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item:**
   - For each item, identify which agent values it the most and assign the item to that agent.

Let's go through the process for each item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 88.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 79.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 62.
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most at 90.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 51.

Here is the allocation based on the above strategy:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the items are allocated so that the total perceived value is high.
