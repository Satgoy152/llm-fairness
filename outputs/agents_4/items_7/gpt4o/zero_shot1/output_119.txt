Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  70  69  40   7   2  98
1  99  57   0  12  70   5  41
2  63   9  26  29   8  36  95
3  48  24  59  93  85  73  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[43 70 69 40  7  2 98]
 [99 57  0 12 70  5 41]
 [63  9 26 29  8 36 95]
 [48 24 59 93 85 73 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (as there are 4 agents and 7 items).

Let's analyze the valuations for each agent and then decide on the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (98), Item 1 (70), Item 2 (69)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 4 (70), Item 1 (57)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (95), Item 0 (63), Item 5 (36)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (93), Item 4 (85), Item 5 (73)

Now, let's distribute the items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 6 (highest value for Agent 0 and Agent 2, but we'll prioritize Agent 0 here)
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 0 (highest value for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 5 (next best value for Agent 2 after losing Item 6)
- **Agent 3**: Assign Item 3 (highest value for Agent 3)

Now, we have 3 items left: Items 1, 2, 4. Let's allocate these:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 2 (next best value for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 4 (next best value for Agent 1)
- **Agent 3**: Assign Item 1 (next best value for Agent 3)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```
