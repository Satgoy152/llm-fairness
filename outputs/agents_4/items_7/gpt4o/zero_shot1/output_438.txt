Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  78   6   8  80  94  89
1  49  77  36  62  83   6  10
2  83  71  50  53  26  29  19
3  99  88  75  88  89  36  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a reasonably fair share based on their valuations, while also ensuring all items are distributed. We'll try to balance the allocations so that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged.

Here is one possible fair allocation strategy:

1. Assign items with the highest individual valuations first, ensuring each agent gets at least one high-value item if possible.
2. Balance the remaining allocations based on remaining item values and agent needs.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [57, 78, 6, 8, 80, 94, 89]
Agent 1: [49, 77, 36, 62, 83, 6, 10]
Agent 2: [83, 71, 50, 53, 26, 29, 19]
Agent 3: [99, 88, 75, 88, 89, 36, 21]
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 5 (value 94) to Agent 0.
2. Item 0 (value 99) to Agent 3.
3. Item 4 (value 83) to Agent 1.
4. Item 2 (value 50) to Agent 2.
5. Item 1 (value 88) to Agent 3 (Agent 3 has a high valuation here as well).
6. Item 6 (value 89) to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has a high valuation for this item).
7. Item 3 (value 62) to Agent 1 (balancing remaining values).

With this allocation, each agent receives a reasonable share of high-value items based on their preferences, and all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
