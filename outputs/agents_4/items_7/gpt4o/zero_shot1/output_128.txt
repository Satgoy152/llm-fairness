Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  88  92  87  15  95  29
1  25  99  67  53  78  85  75
2  56  85  33  21  30  45   7
3  18  24  74  96   4  12  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while also ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given the table of valuations, let's try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 5 the highest at 95, followed by item 2 at 92. We will allocate item 5 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the highest at 99. We will allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the highest at 56. We will allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the highest at 96. We will allocate item 3 to agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 2, 4, and 6.

5. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item highly at 92, so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.

6. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item at 78, which is the highest among any agent for item 4. We allocate item 4 to agent 1.

7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values this item at 75, which is the highest among any agent for item 6. We allocate item 6 to agent 1.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
