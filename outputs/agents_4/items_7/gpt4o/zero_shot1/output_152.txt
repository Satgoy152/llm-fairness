Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  95  32  67  14  32  73
1  26  90  70  69  41  36  30
2  99  21  94  75  91  30  88
3  24  12  53  98  26  96  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations of the items. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 99. Assign item 0 to agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 95. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 94. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most at 98. Assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 91. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most at 96. Assign item 5 to agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most at 88. Assign item 6 to agent 2.

After this allocation, each agent has received the following:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 4, 6
- Agent 3: Items 3, 5

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
