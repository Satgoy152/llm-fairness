Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  25  61  39  26  14  12
1  17  56   0  72  56  78  70
2  45  73  59  77   1  42  27
3  31  49  19  42  49  62  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We need to ensure that all 7 items are allocated.

Letâ€™s consider the following strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If an agent ends up with more items than others, redistribute items to balance the allocation.

Let's evaluate the optimal allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 62.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 73.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 61.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 72.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 56.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 78.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 70.

Now, let's adjust to ensure each agent gets a fair share:

Agent 1 has too many items, so we redistribute:

- Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 73, so it will stay with Agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 72.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 56.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 78.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it at 69, so Agent 3 can take it.

Redistribute:

- Move Item 4 from Agent 1 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 also values it at 49.
  
Now, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 4, 6

This gives:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.
