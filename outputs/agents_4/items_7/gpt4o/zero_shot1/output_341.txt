Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  58  23  50  26  82  90
1  50  96  51  87  48  62   3
2  29  18  28  87  26  94  98
3  99  63  38  67  94  81  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are assigned. We want to consider a balanced distribution so that each agent gets a fair chance of receiving high-valued items according to their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (90), Item 5 (82)
   - Allocate items 6 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (96), Item 3 (87)
   - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (98), Item 5 (94). However, these items are already taken.
   - Next highest valuations: Item 3 (87)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2. However, item 3 is already taken.
   - Allocate item 4 (26) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 4 (94)
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 3.

Revising based on availability and maximizing total valuation:

- Agent 0: 5, 6
- Agent 1: 1, 3
- Agent 2: 2
- Agent 3: 0, 4

Now, the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives some items, and no item is left unallocated.
