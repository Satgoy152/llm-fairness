Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  23  92  97  68   3  91
1  92  34  42  66  34  13  75
2  81  81  48  25  78  68  39
3  64  72  53  56  61  91  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is assigned to an agent. We can use a method that attempts to balance the total value across agents.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent can potentially receive if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0: 73 + 23 + 92 + 97 + 68 + 3 + 91 = 447
- Agent 1: 92 + 34 + 42 + 66 + 34 + 13 + 75 = 356
- Agent 2: 81 + 81 + 48 + 25 + 78 + 68 + 39 = 420
- Agent 3: 64 + 72 + 53 + 56 + 61 + 91 + 16 = 413

Next, let's attempt to assign items to each agent in a way that maximizes their satisfaction, calculated by their individual valuations:

1. **Assign the highest value item for each agent first**, then fill in the remaining items by looking for the next highest value among the remaining items.

Let's start allocating:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (97).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (92).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 0 and 1 (81 each), but item 0 is already taken, so item 1 is selected.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5 (91).

After this first pass, the allocations are:
- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.

Remaining items to allocate: 2, 4, 6.

Let's allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 92, the highest.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 78, the highest among remaining allocations.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 91, the highest among remaining allocations.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4
- Agent 3: Item 5

Thus, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
