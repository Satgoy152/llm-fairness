Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  25  96  53  70   1  29
1   2  60  84  97  41  56  69
2  46  97  70  28  59  84  78
3  91  25  31  76  46  87  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the constraint of 7 items and 4 agents, one possible approach is to allocate approximately 1 or 2 items per agent, while considering their valuations to ensure a fair distribution.

Below is one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0 (value 98) and item 2 (value 96) to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3 (value 97) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 1 (value 97) and item 5 (value 84) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 4 (value 46) and item 6 (value 20) to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the items are distributed in a way that takes into account the high valuations each agent has for certain items.

Now, presenting the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
