Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  98  18   1  51  45  13
1  41  18  42  50  53  51  89
2  66  76  89  35  58  36  18
3  81   1  69  62   0  69  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's look for a way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (98), Item 0 (91)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (89), Item 5 (51)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (89), Item 1 (76)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (81), Item 3 (62)

Given these observations, we need to allocate items such that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the following allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [6]
- Agent 2: Items [2]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4, 5]

Now, let's verify the allocation:
- Agent 0: 2 items (0, 1), total value = 91 + 98 = 189
- Agent 1: 1 item (6), total value = 89
- Agent 2: 1 item (2), total value = 89
- Agent 3: 3 items (3, 4, 5), total value = 62 + 0 + 69 = 131

The allocation is balanced, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
