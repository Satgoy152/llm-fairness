Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  22  50   0  16  37  44
1  27  80  69  77   3  46  19
2  60  42  27  90  86  56  33
3  24  20  73  92  52  44  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility or value each agent receives. A common approach is to look for a combination that maximizes the sum of the highest values each agent can receive, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  22  50   0  16  37  44
1  27  80  69  77   3  46  19
2  60  42  27  90  86  56  33
3  24  20  73  92  52  44  12
```

Let's analyze each agent's valuation and distribute the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: `Item 2 (50)`, `Item 0 (47)`, `Item 6 (44)`

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: `Item 1 (80)`, `Item 3 (77)`, `Item 2 (69)`

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: `Item 3 (90)`, `Item 4 (86)`, `Item 5 (56)`

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: `Item 3 (92)`, `Item 2 (73)`, `Item 4 (52)`

Based on the highest values, we can allocate items to maximize satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Agent 0** gets `Item 2 (50)`
2. **Agent 1** gets `Item 1 (80)`
3. **Agent 2** gets `Item 3 (90)`
4. **Agent 3** gets `Item 4 (52)`

Remaining items: 0, 5, 6

Since agents received their highest-value items, we can now allocate the remaining items to maximize total utility:

- **Agent 0** gets `Item 0 (47)`
- **Agent 2** gets `Item 5 (56)`
- **Agent 0** gets `Item 6 (44)`

This distribution gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
