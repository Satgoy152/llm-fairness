Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  44  60  55  99  40  66
1  65  27  38  10  85   8  65
2  19  53  14  91  82  59  31
3  33  43  71  45  77  26  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since we have 4 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Our goal is to make sure that the distribution is as fair as possible.

One approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation by each agent, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

Let's start allocating the items:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (65).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (53).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (71).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (91).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (99).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (59).
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (97).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets a fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (highest value for agent 0).
- Agent 1: Item 0 (next highest value for agent 1).
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3, and 5.
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 6.

This allocation considers the highest values for each agent and allocates all items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3, 5],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```
