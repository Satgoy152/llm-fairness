Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  65  96  68  93  30  35
1  75  18  96  59  43  60  76
2  59  35  69  91  98  26  34
3  84   2   6  44  36  88  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 65 96 68 93 30 35]
 [75 18 96 59 43 60 76]
 [59 35 69 91 98 26 34]
 [84  2  6 44 36 88 25]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Choose items that maximize Agent 0's total value:
   - Item 4 (value 93)
   - Item 2 (value 96)

2. **Agent 1**: Choose items that maximize Agent 1's total value:
   - Item 6 (value 76)

3. **Agent 2**: Choose items that maximize Agent 2's total value:
   - Item 3 (value 91)
   - Item 1 (value 35)

4. **Agent 3**: Choose items that maximize Agent 3's total value:
   - Item 0 (value 84)
   - Item 5 (value 88)

This way, all items are distributed, and each agent gets an integer number of items. Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
