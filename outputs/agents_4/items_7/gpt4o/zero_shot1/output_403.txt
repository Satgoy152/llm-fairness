Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  70  11  78  19  30  99
1  86  63  69  71  54  31  91
2  52   6  32  53  30  62  69
3  65  81  63  49  77  91  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 70 11 78 19 30 99]
 [86 63 69 71 54 31 91]
 [52  6 32 53 30 62 69]
 [65 81 63 49 77 91 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. A common approach to this problem is to iteratively assign each item to the agent who values it most, while keeping track of the total number of items each agent has.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Values: [27, 86, 52, 65]
   - Highest value is 86 (Agent 1).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Values: [70, 63, 6, 81]
   - Highest value is 81 (Agent 3).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Values: [11, 69, 32, 63]
   - Highest value is 69 (Agent 1).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Values: [78, 71, 53, 49]
   - Highest value is 78 (Agent 0).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Values: [19, 54, 30, 77]
   - Highest value is 77 (Agent 3).

6. **Item 5**:
   - Values: [30, 31, 62, 91]
   - Highest value is 91 (Agent 3).

7. **Item 6**:
   - Values: [99, 91, 69, 43]
   - Highest value is 99 (Agent 0).

Now, let's distribute items ensuring each agent gets at least one:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 4]

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
