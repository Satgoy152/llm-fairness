Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10   3  65  67  37  75  38
1   1  39  23  81   2  79  66
2  34   5  60  29  31  32  69
3  79  90   9  27  93  68  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10  3 65 67 37 75 38]
 [ 1 39 23 81  2 79 66]
 [34  5 60 29 31 32 69]
 [79 90  9 27 93 68 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we need to consider balancing both the number of items each agent receives and the overall value of the items to each agent. Here is one approach to achieve a balanced allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 5, 0
   - Total value: 75 (item 5) + 10 (item 0) = 85

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 3, 6
   - Total value: 81 (item 3) + 66 (item 6) = 147

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 2, 4
   - Total value: 60 (item 2) + 31 (item 4) = 91

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item: 1
   - Total value: 90 (item 1)

This allocation attempts to balance both the number of items and the total value of items each agent receives, given their individual valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
