Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  10  74  94   0   2  99
1  44  89  23  65  58  84  32
2  75  76  53  28  80  99  76
3  43  34  16  90  36  75  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One way to approach this is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest relative value to each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item across all agents**:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (75)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (76)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (74)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (94)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (80)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (99)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (99)

2. **Assign items to agents based on these values, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items**:

   - Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 6]
   - Agent 1: No items
   - Agent 2: Items [0, 1, 4, 5]
   - Agent 3: No items

This allocation maximizes the value for each agent based on their highest preferences while ensuring that all 7 items are distributed. 

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "3": []
}
```
