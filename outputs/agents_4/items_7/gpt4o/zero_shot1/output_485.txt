Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  84  61  51   7  97  78
1  31  90  51  87  22  84  19
2  58  66  41  71  61   3  69
3  49  22  96  62  48  62  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Assign items based on highest value preference:** Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach should ensure that each agent receives the items they value highly, leading to a fair distribution based on preferences.

2. **Check for balance:** Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and adjust allocations if necessary to ensure a fair distribution among agents.

Let's go through the items and assign them based on the highest valuation:

- **Item 0:** Highest value is 72 by Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Highest value is 90 by Agent 1.
- **Item 2:** Highest value is 96 by Agent 3.
- **Item 3:** Highest value is 87 by Agent 1.
- **Item 4:** Highest value is 61 by Agent 2.
- **Item 5:** Highest value is 97 by Agent 0.
- **Item 6:** Highest value is 78 by Agent 0.

Now, let's allocate these items to the agents:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and maximizes their total value based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, respecting their individual valuations.
