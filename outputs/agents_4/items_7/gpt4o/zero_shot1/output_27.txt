Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  51  41  52  17   5  82
1   3   1  80  53  58  69  47
2  70  87  11  91  30  84  89
3   0  40  88  55  98  85  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest value each agent has for the items, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value is for item 6 (value 82).
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value is for item 2 (value 80).
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value is for item 3 (value 91).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value is for item 4 (value 98).
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (0, 1, and 5).

5. **Remaining Items Allocation:**
   - Item 5: Highest value by agent 2 (value 84).
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 2.
   - Item 1: Highest value by agent 2 (value 87).
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
   - Item 0: Highest value by agent 2 (value 70).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

Now each item is allocated, and each agent has received at least one item. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
