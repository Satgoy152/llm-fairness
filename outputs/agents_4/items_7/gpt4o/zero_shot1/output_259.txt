Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  52  35  95  19  92  29
1  39  48  35  29   5  89  10
2  51  60  19   8  68  22  58
3  78  64  34   2  45  68  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction or fairness among the agents. This is often approached using algorithms like the "maximum weight matching" in bipartite graphs or other fair division methods. However, given the small number of agents and items, a simpler heuristic approach can be used to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (95), Item 5 (92)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (89), Item 0 (39)
   - Since Item 5 is also highly valued by another agent and was already considered, allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (68), Item 1 (60)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (78), Item 1 (64)
   - Since Item 0 is already allocated, allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate 3 more items, ensuring a fair distribution:

5. **Agent 0:**
   - Remaining top options: Item 5 (92)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0 (since it wasn't chosen by others earlier).

6. **Agent 2:**
   - Remaining top options: Item 6 (58)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2.

7. **Agent 1:**
   - Remaining top options: Item 2 (35)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, each agent should have received a fairly valued item according to their preferences, and all 7 items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1]
}
```
