Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  65  69  70  42   7  72
1  15  99  31  98  17  98  67
2  15  63  31  38  87  84  15
3  39  99  27  74  91  41  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. There are 7 items and 4 agents, so one possible distribution could be giving some agents two items and others one item, or distributing them in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction.

Hereâ€™s one potential allocation that aims to fairly distribute the items based on their valuations:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value: 93)
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value: 99)
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value: 69)
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value: 98)
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value: 87)
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value: 84)
7. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value: 73)

This allocation considers giving each agent items they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed.

Based on this, the JSON allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6]
}
```
