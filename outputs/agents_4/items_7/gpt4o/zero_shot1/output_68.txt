Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  63  55   9  95  12  48
1   5  29  13   1  43  61  74
2  28   0  25  25  35  56  66
3  14  10  69  69  47  34  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10 63 55  9 95 12 48]
 [ 5 29 13  1 43 61 74]
 [28  0 25 25 35 56 66]
 [14 10 69 69 47 34 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to balance the distribution so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (95), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 also has high valuations for items 1 (63) and 2 (55). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the most (74), so assign item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 also has a relatively high valuation for item 5 (61), so assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (25), and since no one else has a significantly higher valuation for it, assign item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 2 also values item 0 (28) highly, so assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - The remaining item is item 2, which Agent 3 values at 69, the highest among all agents. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```
