Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  63  76  64  34  25  77
1  88  12  99  65  95  14  32
2  15  26  66  50  95  92  64
3  46  11  34  17  93  34  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from the items they receive. We'll consider each agent's preference for each item to ensure a fair distribution.

Based on the given valuations, let's try to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 88.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 63.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 99.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the highest at 65.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 95.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the highest at 92.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the highest at 77.

With this initial allocation, Agent 3 receives no items. To ensure fairness, we'll redistribute some items so that each agent receives at least one:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 3 (Agent 3 values it at 46, which is the second-highest valuation).
- Reassign Item 6 to Agent 3 (Agent 3 values it at 27, which is the highest among the remaining).

Here's a revised allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the items are fairly distributed based on the highest available valuations.
