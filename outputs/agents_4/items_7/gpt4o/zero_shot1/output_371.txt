Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  61   4  34  74  66  32
1  10  42  41  23   9  41  56
2   4  70  17  32  87  70  21
3  25  10  14  74  41  93  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and each item is assigned to one agent only. Hereâ€™s one possible way to allocate the items based on maximizing individual agent valuations for each item:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the values for Agent 0, the highest values are for items 4 (74) and 0 (72). Allocating these items to Agent 0 ensures that they receive the highest possible value.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has relatively high values for items 6 (56) and 2 (41). Allocating these items to Agent 1 maximizes their value.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 (87) and 1 (70). However, since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0, we consider the next highest value that isn't already allocated, which is item 5 (70).

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest value for item 5 (93). However, item 5 is already allocated to Agent 2, so we allocate the next highest available item which is item 3 (74).

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 6, 2
- Agent 2 receives items: 5
- Agent 3 receives items: 1, 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
