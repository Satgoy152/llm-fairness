Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  84  80  10  38  13  96
1  32  82  14  97   8  24  36
2  46  11   4  92  97  86  90
3  87  74  58  80  69  40   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives according to their given valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and that all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 6 (value 96). The next highest is item 0 (value 94). Thus, Agent 0 will take items 6 and 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 3 (value 97). Agent 1 will take item 3.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 4 (value 97). The next highest is item 5 (value 86). Thus, Agent 2 will take items 4 and 5.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued item for Agent 3 is item 0 (value 87), but since item 0 is already allocated, the next highest that hasn't been allocated is item 1 (value 74). So, Agent 3 will take item 1.

Now, let's check if all items are allocated:
- Items allocated: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
- The remaining item is 2.

Agent 0 is currently receiving 2 items, so we can adjust allocations to ensure all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0**: Already has items 0 and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Already has item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Already has items 4 and 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Has item 1 and will also receive item 2 to fill the allocation.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution attempts to respect the highest valuations possible.
