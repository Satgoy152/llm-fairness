Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  27   5  32  66  88  69
1  34  75  86  90  22  39  35
2  53  34  33   3  48  31  44
3  13  40   1  99  26  95  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 75 86 90 22 39 35]
 [53 34 33  3 48 31 44]
 [13 40  1 99 26 95 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations provided by the agents. A possible approach is to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by giving them items they value highly while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and make an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (88), 4 (66), 6 (69)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (90), 2 (86), 1 (75)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 0 (53), 4 (48), 6 (44)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (99), 5 (95), 6 (84)
   - Allocate item 3 is already allocated, so allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, re-evaluate the remaining items and ensure all are allocated:

- Item 1: Highest valuation remaining by Agent 1 (75)
- Item 2: Highest valuation remaining by Agent 1 (86)
- Item 4: Highest valuation remaining by Agent 0 (66)

Finalize allocations:
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: 5, 4
- Agent 1: 3, 1, 2
- Agent 2: 0
- Agent 3: 6

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [3, 1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6]
}
```
