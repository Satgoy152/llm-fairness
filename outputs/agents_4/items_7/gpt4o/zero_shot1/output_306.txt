Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  64  34  10  53  18  38
1  41  27  86  97  46  40  39
2  54  22  14  54  46  70  19
3  76  26  86  69  96  55  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall utility, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. A simple heuristic is to allocate items based on the highest value an agent has for each item, ensuring that all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 3 values it at 76 (highest value).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 64 (highest value).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 86 (highest value).

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 97 (highest value).

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 3 values it at 96 (highest value).

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 70 (highest value).

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 3 values it at 80 (highest value).

After allocating based on the highest values, we need to ensure each agent gets an item if possible. 

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2, 3]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [0, 4, 6]

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and ensures all items are allocated. Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
