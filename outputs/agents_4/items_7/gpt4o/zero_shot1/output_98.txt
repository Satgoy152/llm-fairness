Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  65  50  11   2  74  86
1  72  33  40  84  91  52   5
2  25  39  67  78  54  65  33
3  79  44  36  59  65  77  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Key Preferences**: Look at the highest valuations each agent has for the items, and try to allocate those items to those agents.

2. **Ensure Coverage**: Make sure that all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item, if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If needed, adjust allocations to ensure fairness, especially if one agent has excessively high value over multiple items.

Here is a proposed allocation based on the given valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Highly values item 6 (86) and item 5 (74).
- **Agent 1**: Highly values item 4 (91) and item 3 (84).
- **Agent 2**: Highly values item 3 (78) and item 2 (67).
- **Agent 3**: Highly values item 6 (90) and item 5 (77).

Optimal allocation considering these preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (79).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (65).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (67).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (84).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (91).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (77).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (86).

This allocation balances the high preferences across agents while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
