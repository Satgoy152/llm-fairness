Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  30  93   9  68  89  99
1  24  31  47  12  98  15  28
2  98   8  81  41  60  91  45
3  59  84  39  32  22  48  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 30 93  9 68 89 99]
 [24 31 47 12 98 15 28]
 [98  8 81 41 60 91 45]
 [59 84 39 32 22 48 73]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. First, let's allocate the items to the agents based on maximizing their individual value for that item. Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 98
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it at 84
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 93
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 41
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 98
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 89
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 99

2. After this initial allocation, ensure that each agent receives at least one item. If any agent is left without an item, reallocate some items to ensure fairness.

Initial allocation based on maximum values:
- Agent 0: [2, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0, 3]
- Agent 3: [1]

All agents have received at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
