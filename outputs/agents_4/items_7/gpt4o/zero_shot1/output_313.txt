Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  86  29  57  22  13  29
1  43  15  57  31   3  70  56
2   1  54  39  67  10  93  23
3  94  94  41  65  51  88  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One possible approach is to assign items to agents based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, while maximizing the total value.

Here is a possible allocation of items to agents:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation for this item is by Agent 0 with a value of 96.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation for this item is by Agent 0 with a value of 86.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation for this item is by Agent 1 with a value of 57.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation for this item is by Agent 2 with a value of 67.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation for this item is by Agent 3 with a value of 51.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation for this item is by Agent 2 with a value of 93.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation for this item is by Agent 3 with a value of 71.

By following this method, each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed, considering the highest valuation for each item. Each agent receives a number of items based on their highest bids.
