Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  44  32  89  81  21  30
1  87  87  32  99  34  74  10
2  76  26  23  48  91  71  14
3  98  33  86  81  13  49   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 33 86 81 13 49  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences. The goal is to assign each of the 7 items to one of the 4 agents such that no item is unallocated and each agent can receive any number of items (including zero). Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing individual valuations:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation for each item and assign it to the respective agent.
2. Ensure each item is only assigned once and total assigned items equal 7.
3. If conflicts arise (more than one agent having the same highest valuation for an item), choose the allocation that maximizes the overall satisfaction or consider a fair distribution.

Here's an allocation that achieves that:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 3 (98).
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (44).
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 3 (86).
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 1 (99).
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 2 (91).
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 1 (74).
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 0 (30).

Based on this approach, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated items based on their highest valuation, ensuring a fair distribution according to the given data.
