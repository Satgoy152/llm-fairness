Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  66  56  32  17   0  62
1  19   6  48  97  71  84  76
2  57  29  38  11   2  90  76
3  45  90  31  16  94  85  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should aim to distribute items in a manner that optimizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm or a similar strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Let's begin by assigning the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 18 + 66 + 56 + 32 + 17 + 0 + 62 = 251
   - Agent 1: 19 + 6 + 48 + 97 + 71 + 84 + 76 = 401
   - Agent 2: 57 + 29 + 38 + 11 + 2 + 90 + 76 = 303
   - Agent 3: 45 + 90 + 31 + 16 + 94 + 85 + 76 = 437

2. Allocate the items in a way that each agent receives items they value the most.

By inspecting the table, we can see:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4.

Let's allocate these high-value items first:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Next, allocate the remaining items to maximize each agent's valuation. Based on remaining valuations, we consider the following allocations:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 2, who values it at 57.
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 0, who values it at 56.
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 3, who values it at 76.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated efficiently based on the given valuations.
