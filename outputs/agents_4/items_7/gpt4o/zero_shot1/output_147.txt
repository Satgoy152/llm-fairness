Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  80  75  71  51  62  97
1   2  30   7  66  63  75  91
2  76  47  60  64  88  19   0
3  87  73  55  17  71  12  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values items highly compared to the others, especially for items 1, 2, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has moderately high valuations but not as high as others for any specific items.
3. **Agent 2** shows high interest, particularly in items 0 and 4.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 0 and relatively high interests in items 1 and 3.

Given this, a possible fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 6 (valuations: 80, 97)
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 (valuation: 75)
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 4 (valuations: 76, 88)
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 3 (valuations: 55, 17)

This allocation considers each agent's high valuation items while distributing the total items evenly. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
