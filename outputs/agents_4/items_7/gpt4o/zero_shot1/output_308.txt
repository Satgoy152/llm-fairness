Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  20  83  22  63   9  13
1  42  78  11  34  11  37  29
2  55  89  45  45   8  81  59
3  94  38  93  38  17  96  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56 20 83 22 63  9 13]
 [42 78 11 34 11 37 29]
 [55 89 45 45  8 81 59]
 [94 38 93 38 17 96 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A possible approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum matching" in a weighted bipartite graph, where we try to match items to agents based on the highest values.

Here's a potential allocation based on maximizing individual agent valuations:

1. Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 94 for item 0, so assign item 0 to agent 3.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 78 for item 1, so assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 83 for item 2, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation of 38 for item 3, so assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 63 for item 4, so assign item 4 to agent 0.
6. Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 96 for item 5, so assign item 5 to agent 3.
7. Agent 3 has a high valuation of 88 for item 6, so assign item 6 to agent 3.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 4
- Agent 1 gets items: 1
- Agent 2 gets items: (none)
- Agent 3 gets items: 0, 3, 5, 6

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned and the highest possible valuations are respected. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
