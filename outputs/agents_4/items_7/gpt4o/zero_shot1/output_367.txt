Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  20  77  87  53  28  73
1  92  91  68  79  30  11  74
2  49  80  92  73  91  11  89
3  10  18   6  50  84  24   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 20 77 87 53 28 73]
 [92 91 68 79 30 11 74]
 [49 80 92 73 91 11 89]
 [10 18  6 50 84 24  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 7 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 2 items and the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's try to allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent to maximize fairness:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (87)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (92)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (92)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (84)

Now, we have allocated 4 items to 4 agents, and we have 3 items left (1, 5, and 6).

Let's allocate the remaining items considering the next highest valuations:

5. Agent 0 has the next highest value for Item 6 (73).

6. Agent 2 has the next highest value for Item 1 (80).

7. Agent 3 has the next highest value for Item 5 (24).

All items are now allocated. Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
