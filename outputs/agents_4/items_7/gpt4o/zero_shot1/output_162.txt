Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  80  19  75  59  45   6
1  76  93  50  47  23  45   8
2   8  11  81  86  88  59  17
3  90  39  88  99  81  63  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 80 19 75 59 45  6]
 [76 93 50 47 23 45  8]
 [ 8 11 81 86 88 59 17]
 [90 39 88 99 81 63 80]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider maximizing the overall value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's evaluate the values provided for each agent:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item is 1 (value = 80)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item is 1 (value = 93), but it's already taken.
   - Next highest is item 0 (value = 76)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item is 4 (value = 88)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value item is 3 (value = 99)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

After these allocations, we have allocated 4 items. Now we need to allocate the remaining 3 items:

5. **Allocating Remaining Items:**
   - Item 2: Highest value for Agent 3 (88), but Agent 3 already has item 3.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, whose next highest value is 81.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Highest value for Agent 2 (59), but Agent 2 already has items 4 and 2.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3, whose next highest is 63.

7. **Item 6:**
   - Highest value for Agent 3 (80), but Agent 3 already has items 3 and 5.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0, whose next highest is 6.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the value based on their preferences.
