Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  89  66  94   8  28  98
1  83  89  56  77  98  54  21
2  75  98  30  48  61  94  66
3  22   7  99   0  98  74  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 89 56 77 98 54 21]
 [75 98 30 48 61 94 66]
 [22  7 99  0 98 74 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible, given the number of items and agents). We will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest valuations: Item 3 (94), Item 6 (98)
  - Allocate: Item 6

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 0 (83)
  - Allocate: Item 4

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest valuations: Item 1 (98), Item 5 (94)
  - Allocate: Item 1

- **Agent 3:**
  - Highest valuations: Item 2 (99), Item 4 (98)
  - Allocate: Item 2

Now we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 3, 5) while considering the balance of total valuations:

- **Remaining items to allocate:** 0, 3, 5

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (next high valuation: 83)
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (next high valuation: 94)
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (next high valuation: 94)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation and ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items.
