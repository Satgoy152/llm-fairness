Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  18  18  46  34  11  11
1  56  35  62  48  97  58  56
2  92  66  78  96  16  32  29
3  71  50  12  93  85  81  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's valuation is maximized based on their preferences. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated.

Let's approach this problem by attempting to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We'll look at the highest valuations for each item and try to allocate them to the corresponding agents, ensuring that every agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (92) and item 3 (96). 
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (97).
3. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (81) and item 1 (50).
4. **Agent 0** can take the remaining items, item 2 (18) and item 6 (11).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 3**: Items 5, 1
- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 6

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation provides a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
