Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  76  17  45  43  20  80
1   8  60  41  19  67  30  86
2  20  36   2  88   9  33  29
3  34  47  89   2  35   4  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and determine the allocations:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 6 (80).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 6 (86).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3 (88).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 2 (89).

Considering these preferences and aiming for fairness, a potential allocation strategy can be devised. Additionally, we should ensure that no two agents receive the same item, and all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 1, as it is highly valued by them.
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 6, as it is their highest valued item.
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 3, since it's their highest valued item.
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 2, as it is their highest valued item.

For the remaining items, we will distribute them based on maximizing the remaining agents' total valuations as much as possible:

- Agent 1 can receive item 4 as it provides a high value.
- Agent 0 can receive item 5, which is more valuable to them than to other agents.
- Agent 2 can receive item 0, which is the least valuable to agent 3 and doesn't conflict with high-value items for others.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that are relatively valuable to them, and all items are fairly distributed.
