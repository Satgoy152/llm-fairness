Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  57  46  11  24  59  92
1   1  59  22  67  99  97  96
2   1  92  92  10   3  69  78
3  75  48  30  91  39  89  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 7 57 46 11 24 59 92]
 [ 1 59 22 67 99 97 96]
 [ 1 92 92 10  3 69 78]
 [75 48 30 91 39 89 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others, and we aim to distribute them as fairly as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (59), followed by item 6 (92).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (99), followed by item 5 (97).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values items 1 and 2 equally (92), followed by item 6 (78).
   - Since item 6 is already allocated, allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (91), followed by item 5 (89).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

### Remaining Items:
- Items 0, 2, and 5 are unallocated.

5. **Agent 0 (continued):**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest among the remaining (59).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1 (continued):**
   - Agent 1 values item 2 next highest after the already allocated items (22).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 3 (continued):**
   - Agent 3 values item 0 next highest after the already allocated items (75).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocation:
Now, each agent has received items based on their valuation preferences, and all 7 items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly, considering the agents' valuation preferences.
