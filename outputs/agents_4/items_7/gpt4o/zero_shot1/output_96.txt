Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  61   6  12  57  26  81
1  24  81  93   9  83  60  43
2  45  73  25  55  21  67  76
3  33  30  53  38  82   0  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 61  6 12 57 26 81]
 [24 81 93  9 83 60 43]
 [45 73 25 55 21 67 76]
 [33 30 53 38 82  0 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value for each agent. This means assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations. Let's perform this allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value: Item 6 (value = 81)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value: Item 2 (value = 93)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value: Item 6 (value = 76), but it's already taken
   - Next highest value: Item 5 (value = 67)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value: Item 4 (value = 82)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 3

5. **Unallocated Items: 0, 1, 3**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 and Agent 2 have relatively high values (Agent 0 = 63, Agent 2 = 45)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0

   - Item 1: Agent 1 has the highest value (value = 81)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1

   - Item 3: Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation (value = 55)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2

Now that each item has been allocated to agents, here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
