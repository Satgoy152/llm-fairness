Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  83  29  10  33  87  74
1  24  26  91  36  27  39   6
2  20  72  19  98   8  44   0
3  64  69  60  78  81  36  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, ensuring every item is allocated and the distribution is as balanced and equitable as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Evaluate each agent's highest-valued items and distribute them in a way that maximizes satisfaction across all agents.
2. Ensure each agent has at least one item, where feasible, to maintain fairness in distribution.

Let's analyze and allocate:

- Agent 0: Prefers items with highest valuations: 1 (83), 5 (87), 0 (74).
- Agent 1: Prefers items with highest valuations: 2 (91), 3 (36).
- Agent 2: Prefers items with highest valuations: 3 (98), 1 (72).
- Agent 3: Prefers items with highest valuations: 4 (81), 3 (78), 0 (64).

Now, allocate the items to maximize overall satisfaction:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest valuation by Agent 0).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation by Agent 1).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation by Agent 2).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest valuation by Agent 3).

Now, distribute the remaining items:

5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation by Agent 0).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (second-highest valuation by Agent 2).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (to balance the distribution and since Agent 3 still has a decent valuation of 11).

The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their preferences while maintaining a fair distribution.
