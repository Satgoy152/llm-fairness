Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  87   6  21  57  70  25
1  36  12  76  71   4  38  42
2  34  92  18   2  92  36  71
3  79  57  24  33  57  21  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuation on item 1 (87) and item 5 (70).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuation on item 2 (76) and item 3 (71).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuation on item 4 (92) and item 6 (71).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - High valuation on item 0 (79) and item 4 (57).

Let's allocate items based on these considerations:

- **Agent 0** gets items: [1, 5]
  - Item 1: 87
  - Item 5: 70

- **Agent 1** gets item: [2]
  - Item 2: 76

- **Agent 2** gets items: [4, 6]
  - Item 4: 92
  - Item 6: 71

- **Agent 3** gets items: [0, 3]
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 3: 33

Now, I'll present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing all 7 items among the 4 agents.
