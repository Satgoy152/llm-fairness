Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  63  64  41  66  32  44
1  78  14  94  45  40  89  22
2  39  43  22  74  42  95  43
3  70  31   5  58  48  16  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Evaluate the highest valuations for each item across agents.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 78.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 63.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 74.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 66.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 75.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the total valuation each agent receives for the chosen items. Ensure no items are left unallocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 5.
- Agent 3 receives item 6.
