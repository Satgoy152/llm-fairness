Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  60  68  97  45  75  22
1  11  68  22   4  33  20  73
2  64  59  90  84  46  26  53
3  69  37   7  36  58  56   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest, so we assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 6, so we assign item 6 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2, so we assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 0, so we assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We still need to allocate 3 more items.

5. Agent 0 has the next highest value for item 5, so we assign item 5 to Agent 0.
6. Agent 2 has the next highest value for item 1, so we assign item 1 to Agent 2.
7. Agent 3 has the next highest value for item 4, so we assign item 4 to Agent 3.

All items are now allocated, and each agent has received at least one item.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
