Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  22  94  63  92  90  44
1  31  90  88  57  60  82  40
2  60  74  57  97  35  64  45
3  16  92  16  29  59   9  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to use a method such as maximizing the overall utility or attempting to equalize the distribution of values each agent receives. Given the table, let's attempt a fair allocation:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (94)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (90)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (97)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (92), but already assigned. Next highest is Item 6 (75).
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items**: 0, 4, 5

6. **Re-evaluate for remaining items:**

   - **Item 0**: 
     - Agent 1 values it the most (31)
     - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
   
   - **Item 4**: 
     - Agent 0 values it the most (92)
     - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

   - **Item 5**: 
     - Agent 0 values it the most (90)
     - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, while ensuring all 7 items are allocated.
