Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  26  58  67  62  29  55
1  80  25  24  13   9   4  20
2  71  66  25  73  10  98   7
3  78  61  48   5  51  53  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one reasonable approach is to maximize the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7. Here's how the allocation could look:

1. **Agent 0**: Choose items with the highest values for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Choose items with the highest values for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Choose items with the highest values for Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Choose items with the highest values for Agent 3.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** values items as follows: [85, 26, 58, 67, 62, 29, 55]. The highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 0 (value 85).

- **Agent 1** values items as follows: [80, 25, 24, 13, 9, 4, 20]. The highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 0, but since it's already allocated, the next highest value is item 1 (value 25).

- **Agent 2** values items as follows: [71, 66, 25, 73, 10, 98, 7]. The highest valued items for Agent 2 are item 5 (value 98) and item 3 (value 73).

- **Agent 3** values items as follows: [78, 61, 48, 5, 51, 53, 30]. The highest valued items for Agent 3 are item 0 (value 78) and item 1 (value 61), but since item 0 is allocated, the best available alternative is item 4 (value 51).

Considering the above, here's a possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 5
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 4, 6

Now let's format this allocation into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
