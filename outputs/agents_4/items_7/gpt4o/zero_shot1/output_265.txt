Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  26  47  58  77  18  99
1   6  22  15  65  84  84  27
2  37  28  85  40  69  28  15
3  13  55  84  26   1  84  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can start by assessing the valuations and then try to distribute the items so that each agent receives a reasonable share of value.

Let's consider the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 56
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 55
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 85
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 65
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 84
- Item 5: Agent 1 and Agent 3 value it equally at 84
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 99

We will allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (where possible):

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 3
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 3
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 0

This allocation respects the preferences as much as possible and ensures each agent receives a fair distribution of items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
