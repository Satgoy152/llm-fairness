Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  35  80  86  61  43  85
1  81   7  67  74   5  35  80
2  33  94  26  94  58  73  84
3  88  50  56  34  53  30  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, it's important to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize the total value across all agents, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Has a high valuation for item 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 1 and 6.
   - Allocate items 1 and 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 3, given the remaining items and moderate valuations.

This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are assigned. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items is 7.
