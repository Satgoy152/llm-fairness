Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  69  84  40  20  44  66
1  60  16  57  21  15  65  38
2  31  29  13  63  76  94   5
3  48  27  93  70  72  47  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, while maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this problem:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:** Look for the highest valuations for each item across all agents to make the allocation more efficient.

2. **Initial Assignment:** Start by allocating items to the agents who value them the most.

3. **Balance the Distribution:** Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible and no agent is overloaded with too many items unless necessary to meet the total allocation.

4. **Optimize Allocation:** Adjust the allocation to ensure that the overall satisfaction is as high as possible while keeping the distribution fair.

By following these steps, we can come up with a fair distribution of items among the agents. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3 and 6.

Considering these aspects, here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 is allocated item 5, which has one of their higher valuations.
- Agent 2 receives item 4, which they value the most.
- Agent 3 receives items 2, 3, and 6, which have high valuations for them.

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
