Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24   7  90  48  33  16  72
1  42  21   3  16  39  20  87
2  52   5  97  65  74  65  68
3  49  57  61  21  77  52  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We can do this by using a greedy approach, assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that all agents receive at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocations:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 52 by agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 57 by agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 97 by agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 65 by agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 77 by agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 65 by agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: The highest value is 87 by agent 1.

Now let's assign the items:

- Agent 2 gets items 0, 2, 3, and 5.
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 0 doesn't get any items.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
