Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  15  99  98  90  54  62
1  35  57  60  33  38   3   8
2  76  62  67  93  59  80   5
3  66  27  17  14  16  81   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent's overall satisfaction is maximized based on their valuations. One effective approach is to allocate items iteratively by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 76 by agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 62 by agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 99 by agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 98 by agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 90 by agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 81 by agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 62 by agent 0.

After this allocation, let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1: No item
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: Item 5

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [5]
}
```
