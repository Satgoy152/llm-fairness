Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  15  79  37  52  61   5
1  42  95  67  74  52  68   8
2  62  49  99  10  86   2  87
3  27  51  75  46  85   7   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 15 79 37 52 61  5]
 [42 95 67 74 52 68  8]
 [62 49 99 10 86  2 87]
 [27 51 75 46 85  7  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's a possible allocation considering the valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuation for item 2.
2. Agent 1 has high valuation for item 1.
3. Agent 2 has high valuation for item 2 but can settle for item 6 (87).
4. Agent 3 has high valuation for item 4.

Let's proceed with the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item and the total valuation is reasonable:

- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 79).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 95).
- Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 87).
- Assign item 4 to agent 3 (value 85).
- Assign item 0 to agent 3 (value 27).
- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 74).
- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 61).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their high valuations and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
