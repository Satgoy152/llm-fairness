Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  16  75  86  85   2  46
1  42  22  52  39  93  63  22
2  34  47  14  11  82  58  96
3  43  75  87  80  59  82  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 16 75 86 85  2 46]
 [42 22 52 39 93 63 22]
 [34 47 14 11 82 58 96]
 [43 75 87 80 59 82 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent has an integer number of items. 

1. **Agent 0**: They have high valuations for items 0, 2, 3, and 4, but they can't take all since we need to distribute the items fairly.
2. **Agent 1**: They have a high valuation for item 4. 
3. **Agent 2**: They have a high valuation for item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: They have high valuations for items 1 and 2.

Let's try to allocate the items based on the highest value per agent while ensuring no more than 7 items are allocated in total.

- **Agent 0**: Let's give them item 3 (value 86).
- **Agent 1**: Assign them item 4 (value 93).
- **Agent 2**: Assign them item 6 (value 96).
- **Agent 3**: Assign them items 1 and 2 (values 75 and 87).

Now, 5 items have been allocated. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items:

- Assign Agent 0 item 0 (value 67).
- Assign Agent 3 item 5 (value 82).

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their highest valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.
