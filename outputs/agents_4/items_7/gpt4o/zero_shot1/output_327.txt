Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  46  66  89  39  59  17
1  11  51  56   1  32  60  80
2  22  83  56  75  85  93  52
3  78   2  99  60  18  97  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. The goal is to distribute the items so that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  46  66  89  39  59  17
1  11  51  56   1  32  60  80
2  22  83  56  75  85  93  52
3  78   2  99  60  18  97  73
```

We'll allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0:
   - High valuation on item 3 (89) and item 2 (66).
2. Agent 1:
   - High valuation on item 6 (80) and item 5 (60).
3. Agent 2:
   - High valuation on item 5 (93) and item 4 (85).
4. Agent 3:
   - High valuation on item 2 (99) and item 5 (97).

Now, let's assign the items to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences:

- Agent 0 will get items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 will get item 6.
- Agent 2 will get item 4.
- Agent 3 will get items 2 and 5.
- We have one item left (item 1), and we will give it to Agent 2, who has a relatively balanced distribution.

Let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that attempts to balance their total valuation.
