Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  45  63  79  41  28  68
1   4  27  63  53  92  40  89
2   7  39  20  82  10  52  20
3  34  97  23   7  60  89  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that considers the preferences of the agents as reflected in their valuations. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the total value or satisfaction for the agents. Since each agent should receive an integer number of items, we'll ensure that each agent gets at least one item and distribute the remaining items based on the highest valuations.

Let's look at the agents and their highest preferences:

- Agent 0: Highest values are for items 3 (79), 0 (69), and 2 (63).
- Agent 1: Highest values are for items 4 (92), 6 (89), and 2 (63).
- Agent 2: Highest values are for items 3 (82), 5 (52), and 1 (39).
- Agent 3: Highest values are for items 1 (97), 5 (89), and 4 (60).

We can initially allocate each agent one of their highest-valued items:

1. Agent 3 gets item 1 (value 97).
2. Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 92).
3. Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 79).
4. Agent 2 gets item 5 (value 52).

Now we have allocated 4 items, and 3 items remain to be allocated. We'll assign the remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

5. Agent 1 gets item 6 (value 89).
6. Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 69).
7. Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 20).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and we have allocated all 7 items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
