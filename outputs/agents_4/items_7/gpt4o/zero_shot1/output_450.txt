Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40   9  13  35  17  84  21
1  13  12  67  23  20   6  72
2  49  64  80  64  49  21  86
3   8   7  67   0  16  44  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8  7 67  0 16 44 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we can consider the values each agent assigns to each item. A common approach is to ensure each agent gets items that maximize their total valuation, while trying to keep the distribution fair. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (84), Item 3 (35), Item 0 (40)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (67), Item 6 (72)
   - Allocate Items 2 and 6 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (80), Item 6 (86), Item 1 (64)
   - Allocate Items 1 and 4 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (67), Item 6 (73), Item 5 (44)
   - Allocate Items 0 and 3 to Agent 3

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with considerations made to the values agents place on each item.
