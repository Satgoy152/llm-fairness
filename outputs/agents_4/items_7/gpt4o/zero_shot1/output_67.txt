Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  77  62  30  69  44  16
1  93  91   7   8  93  95  88
2  55  43  31  68  82  91  86
3  86  72  51  59  54  73  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can use a greedy approach to achieve this by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. 

Let's go through each item and assign it to the agent who has the highest valuation for it:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0: 65
   - Agent 1: 93
   - Agent 2: 55
   - Agent 3: 86
   - Assign item 0 to agent 1 (highest value: 93).

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 77
   - Agent 1: 91
   - Agent 2: 43
   - Agent 3: 72
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1 (highest value: 91).

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 62
   - Agent 1: 7
   - Agent 2: 31
   - Agent 3: 51
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0 (highest value: 62).

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 30
   - Agent 1: 8
   - Agent 2: 68
   - Agent 3: 59
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2 (highest value: 68).

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0: 69
   - Agent 1: 93
   - Agent 2: 82
   - Agent 3: 54
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1 (highest value: 93).

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0: 44
   - Agent 1: 95
   - Agent 2: 91
   - Agent 3: 73
   - Assign item 5 to agent 1 (highest value: 95).

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0: 16
   - Agent 1: 88
   - Agent 2: 86
   - Agent 3: 74
   - Assign item 6 to agent 1 (highest value: 88).

Now, let's compile the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each item goes to the agent who values it the most.
