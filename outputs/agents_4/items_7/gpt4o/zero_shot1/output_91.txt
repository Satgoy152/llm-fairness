Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  24  99  74  23  89  21
1  29  12  90   3  27   9  84
2  78  43  10  55  92  93  20
3  98  13  43   2  42  58  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the overall satisfaction. One approach is to consider assigning the items based on the highest valuations first. Here's a step-by-step process:

1. List all valuations with corresponding agent-item pairs:
   - (78, 0, 0), (24, 0, 1), (99, 0, 2), (74, 0, 3), (23, 0, 4), (89, 0, 5), (21, 0, 6)
   - (29, 1, 0), (12, 1, 1), (90, 1, 2), (3, 1, 3), (27, 1, 4), (9, 1, 5), (84, 1, 6)
   - (78, 2, 0), (43, 2, 1), (10, 2, 2), (55, 2, 3), (92, 2, 4), (93, 2, 5), (20, 2, 6)
   - (98, 3, 0), (13, 3, 1), (43, 3, 2), (2, 3, 3), (42, 3, 4), (58, 3, 5), (23, 3, 6)

2. Sort these pairs by valuation in descending order:
   - (99, 0, 2), (98, 3, 0), (93, 2, 5), (92, 2, 4), (90, 1, 2), (89, 0, 5), (84, 1, 6), ...

3. Assign items to agents based on the highest available valuation, ensuring each item is only allocated once and each agent receives at least one item until all items are allocated.

4. Based on this approach, here is a possible fair allocation of items:

    - Agent 0 receives items [2]
    - Agent 1 receives items [6]
    - Agent 2 receives items [4, 5]
    - Agent 3 receives items [0]

5. Distribute the remaining items [1, 3] among agents who have received fewer items or lower valued items to balance the allocation:
    - Agent 0 receives item [3]
    - Agent 1 receives item [1]

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, ensuring a balanced and fair allocation.
