Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97   5  44  94  61  54  33
1  81  14  30   7  83  30  10
2  44  78  79  17  52  85  79
3  92  42  14  11   7  52  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations of the items. We'll go through a process of assigning items to agents such that the total value each agent receives is balanced as much as possible.

Let's start by examining the highest valuations for each agent and try to allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation is item 0 (97).
   - Next highest are items 3 (94), 2 (44).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation is item 4 (83).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation is item 5 (85).
   - Next highest are items 2 (79), 6 (79).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation is item 0 (not available), next is item 6 (82).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 3) while trying to balance the total value each agent receives:

- **Agent 0** has item 0. Next highest available item is 2 (44).
- **Agent 1** has item 4. Next highest available is item 3 (7).
- **Agent 2** has item 5. Next highest available is item 1 (78).

Finally, let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 1
- **Agent 3**: Items 6, 2

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the value distributed among the agents based on their preferences.
