Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  40  90  12  13  67  29
1  33  49  56  43  40  44  70
2  42  52  80  29  90  11   0
3  68  36  13  34  62  87  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 40 90 12 13 67 29]
 [33 49 56 43 40 44 70]
 [42 52 80 29 90 11  0]
 [68 36 13 34 62 87 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can apply a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items. Given there are 4 agents and 7 items, not every agent will receive an item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (90).
   - Agent 0 also values item 0 highly (72).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 6 (70).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (90).
   - Agent 2 also has a high valuation for item 2, but since it is already allocated to Agent 0, we consider others like item 1 (52).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5 (87).

Based on this, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets items 1, 3, and 5.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and the total items allocated sum to 7.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
