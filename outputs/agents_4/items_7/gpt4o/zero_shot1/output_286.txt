Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  52   1   2  82  29  72
1  45  81  38  18  45  95  69
2  34  44  67  84  84  30  44
3  41  19  67  24  22  37  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items:**
   - Start by identifying which items have particularly high valuations from specific agents.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate these high-value items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Balance the Allocation:**
   - Distribute the remaining items based on the next highest valuations to ensure fairness and balance.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

- **Item 0:** Allocate to Agent 1 (value: 45)
- **Item 1:** Allocate to Agent 1 (value: 81)
- **Item 2:** Allocate to Agent 3 (value: 67)
- **Item 3:** Allocate to Agent 2 (value: 84)
- **Item 4:** Allocate to Agent 0 (value: 82)
- **Item 5:** Allocate to Agent 1 (value: 95)
- **Item 6:** Allocate to Agent 3 (value: 91)

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of items while giving higher value items to agents who value them most.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents while considering their valuations.
