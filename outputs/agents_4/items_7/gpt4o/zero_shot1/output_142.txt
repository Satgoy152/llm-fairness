Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  54  38  74  60   5  39
1   7  39   5  90  87  98  55
2  67  67   8  21  46  56  42
3  47  39  56  93  79  39  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations. Here's how we can proceed:

1. List all the items and their valuations for each agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. If conflicts arise (i.e., two agents value an item equally), resolve them by considering the overall distribution and ensuring fairness.

Let's perform the allocation:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Agent 2 Value | Agent 3 Value | Allocated to Agent |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| 0    | 82            | 7             | 67            | 47            | 0                  |
| 1    | 54            | 39            | 67            | 39            | 2                  |
| 2    | 38            | 5             | 8             | 56            | 3                  |
| 3    | 74            | 90            | 21            | 93            | 3                  |
| 4    | 60            | 87            | 46            | 79            | 1                  |
| 5    | 5             | 98            | 56            | 39            | 1                  |
| 6    | 39            | 55            | 42            | 48            | 1                  |

Now, let's prepare the JSON output for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations.
