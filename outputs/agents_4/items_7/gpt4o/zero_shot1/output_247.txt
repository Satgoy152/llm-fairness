Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  34  33  30  22  76  80
1  70  15  80  35  40  43  65
2  85  16  19  63  64  88  37
3  96  86  87  21  66   8  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 15 80 35 40 43 65]
 [85 16 19 63 64 88 37]
 [96 86 87 21 66  8 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, as there are four agents and seven items. We want to maximize the total valuation while ensuring a fair distribution of items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations for Agent 0 are item 6 (80) and item 5 (76). 

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations for Agent 1 are item 2 (80) and item 0 (70).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations for Agent 2 are item 5 (88) and item 4 (64).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations for Agent 3 are item 0 (96) and item 1 (86).

Since we need to allocate only seven items and ensure at least one item per agent, we can proceed as follows:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (highest valuation).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (second highest valuation).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (since it is not highly valued by any).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0 after item 6).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0).

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
