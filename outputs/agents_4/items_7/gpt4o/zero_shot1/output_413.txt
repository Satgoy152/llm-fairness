Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  58  63  84  37  56  34
1   5  94  96  83  52  78   8
2   5  19  77  19  40  26  83
3  95  76  77  66  33  15   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41 58 63 84 37 56 34]
 [ 5 94 96 83 52 78  8]
 [ 5 19 77 19 40 26 83]
 [95 76 77 66 33 15  7]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [41, 58, 63, 84, 37, 56, 34]
Agent 1: [5, 94, 96, 83, 52, 78, 8]
Agent 2: [5, 19, 77, 19, 40, 26, 83]
Agent 3: [95, 76, 77, 66, 33, 15, 7]
```

Based on the maximum valuation strategy, where each item should ideally go to the agent who values it the most, we have:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (95).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (94).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (96).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (84).
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (52).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (78).
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (83).

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents:

- Agent 0 will get item 3.
- Agent 1 will get items 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Agent 2 will get item 6.
- Agent 3 will get item 0.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0]
}
```
