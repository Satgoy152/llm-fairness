Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  70  18  28  90  16  29
1  50   1  96  29  95  35  80
2  28  91  20  12  85  43  17
3  22  92  20  62  58  10  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 70 18 28 90 16 29]
 [50  1 96 29 95 35 80]
 [28 91 20 12 85 43 17]
 [22 92 20 62 58 10 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. This approach seeks to distribute the items such that agents get items that they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated and no agent is left out.

Let's summarize the valuations for clarity:

```
Agent 0: [50, 70, 18, 28, 90, 16, 29]
Agent 1: [50, 1, 96, 29, 95, 35, 80]
Agent 2: [28, 91, 20, 12, 85, 43, 17]
Agent 3: [22, 92, 20, 62, 58, 10, 30]
```

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 4**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 2**: Highest value is 96 by Agent 1.
3. **Item 1**: Highest value is 92 by Agent 3.
4. **Item 0**: Highest value is 50 by Agents 0 and 1. Assign to Agent 0, who has fewer items.
5. **Item 5**: Highest value is 43 by Agent 2.
6. **Item 3**: Highest value is 62 by Agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 80 by Agent 1.

Let's verify if this allocation is fair and complete, ensuring each agent gets some items and all items are distributed.

The final allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 4, and 6.
- Agent 2 receives item 5.
- Agent 3 receives items 1 and 3.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their highest-valued items.
