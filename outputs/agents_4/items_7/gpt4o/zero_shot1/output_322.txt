Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  50  77  66  49  95  55
1  15  79  65  11  82  17  65
2  84  66  60   2  69  31  71
3  55  45  36  61   8  80  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[80 50 77 66 49 95 55]
 [15 79 65 11 82 17 65]
 [84 66 60  2 69 31 71]
 [55 45 36 61  8 80 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for all agents. This approach is similar to finding a maximum weight matching in a bipartite graph. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Choose the highest value for each item across all agents and assign the item to the respective agent, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the total items.

Let's analyze the allocation based on the given table:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 84 by agent 2.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 79 by agent 1.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 77 by agent 0.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 66 by agent 0.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 82 by agent 1.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 95 by agent 0.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 71 by agent 2.

Now, distribute the items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 6
- Agent 3: No items

This allocation maximizes the valuation for each item and ensures each agent gets a fair share. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": []
}
```
