Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  67  86  47  38  25  96
1  98  64  36   1   5  85  57
2  40  34  19  16  22  82  57
3   1  94  47  39  65   9  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Considering the high value agent 0 places on item 6 (96), we'll allocate item 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 highly (98). We'll allocate item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 places the highest value on item 5 (82). Therefore, we'll allocate item 5 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 highly (94). We'll allocate item 1 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 of the 7 items. We need to allocate the remaining items (2, 3, and 4).

5. **Agent 0**: Item 2 has a high value for agent 0 (86), so it makes sense to allocate this item to agent 0.

6. **Agent 3**: Item 4 has a relatively high value for agent 3 (65), so we'll allocate item 4 to agent 3.

7. **Agent 1**: Finally, item 3, although not highly valued by any agent, can be allocated to agent 1 who values it least negatively.

This allocation strategy fairly distributes the items based on the individual valuations as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
