Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  95  23  49  64  61  14
1   6  67  57  90  86  65   9
2  44  21  21   1  36  14   2
3  11  71  76  99  57   1   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 95 23 49 64 61 14]
 [ 6 67 57 90 86 65  9]
 [44 21 21  1 36 14  2]
 [11 71 76 99 57  1  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, considering their individual preferences for different items. Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, some agents may receive more items than others. Let's analyze the valuations to distribute the items efficiently.

Here's a possible allocation considering the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 has a very high valuation for item 3, which is the highest individual valuation in the table.
- Agent 2 has generally low valuations, so we'll allocate items that maximize the total satisfaction without taking high-value items from others.

Let's distribute the items:

1. Item 0: Assign to Agent 0 (value 75)
2. Item 1: Assign to Agent 0 (value 95)
3. Item 2: Assign to Agent 3 (value 76)
4. Item 3: Assign to Agent 1 (value 90)
5. Item 4: Assign to Agent 1 (value 86)
6. Item 5: Assign to Agent 0 (value 61)
7. Item 6: Assign to Agent 2 (value 2) - minimal impact on other agents

This allocation tries to maximize the total utility based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2]
}
```
