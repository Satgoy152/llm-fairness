Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  51  55  75  12  72  26
1  61   3  90  93  65  33  25
2  92  51  47  90  87  68  42
3  39  35  41  58  97  42  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 51 47 90 87 68 42]
 [39 35 41 58 97 42 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are distributed.

Let's consider the valuation matrix:

```
         0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0: 29  51  55  75  12  72  26
Agent 1: 61   3  90  93  65  33  25
Agent 2: 92  51  47  90  87  68  42
Agent 3: 39  35  41  58  97  42  61
```

We will use a greedy strategy to assign items based on the highest value an agent places on an item, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 93).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 92).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 97).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 90).
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 72).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 51).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value 61).

Now, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most while ensuring each agent has a chance to receive items.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
