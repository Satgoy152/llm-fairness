Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  42  78  24  96  49  52
1  97  47  21  19  85  19  29
2  72  48  65  90  98  18  55
3  26  46  40  32   9   1  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that the distribution is as envy-free as possible given the valuations. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what any other agent received, based on their valuation.

First, let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 19 + 42 + 78 + 24 + 96 + 49 + 52 = 360
- Agent 1: 97 + 47 + 21 + 19 + 85 + 19 + 29 = 317
- Agent 2: 72 + 48 + 65 + 90 + 98 + 18 + 55 = 446
- Agent 3: 26 + 46 + 40 + 32 + 9 + 1 + 80 = 234

Next, we will allocate the items in a manner that attempts to balance these total valuations. 

Let's start by identifying which items are most valuable to each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (96).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (97).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (98).
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (80).

Now, let's proceed with allocating these highly valued items:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (98) because Agent 2 values it the highest and their total valuation is also the highest.
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (97) as it is their highest valued item.
3. Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 (80) as it is their highest valued item.

Next, we allocate the remaining items to balance the total perceived value for each agent:

- Item 1: Highest remaining value is for Agent 0 (42).
- Item 2: Highest remaining value is for Agent 0 (78).
- Item 3: Highest remaining value is for Agent 2 (90).
- Item 5: Remaining choice goes to Agent 1 (19).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total perceived value is somewhat balanced, considering the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to provide a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations.
