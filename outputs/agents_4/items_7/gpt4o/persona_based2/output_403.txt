Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  99  12  60  21  62  54
1  60  67  89  89  58  50  34
2  21  26   6  39  47  20  56
3  12  77  62  32  52  47  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, I'll aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Here’s the detailed step-by-step process for determining the allocations:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (99).
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 (89) and 3 (89).
   - Agent 2 does not have particularly high valuations, but has a relatively higher valuation for item 6 (56).
   - Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 6 (67).

2. **Allocation Process**:
   - **Agent 0**: Considering that Agent 0 values item 1 (99) the most, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values items 2 (89) and 3 (89) the most, but item 2 is unique in its high valuation. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - **Agent 2**: While Agent 2 does not have strong preferences, the highest valuation is for item 6 (56). Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
   - **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6, but since it's already allocated to Agent 2, allocate item 5 (47) to Agent 3, as it is the next highest valuation for Agent 3.

3. **Remaining Allocations**:
   - Now, distribute the remaining items (0, 3, 4) considering the remaining preferences:
     - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 89).
     - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (value 52).
     - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 21).

4. **Final Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 0
   - Agent 1: Items 2 and 3
   - Agent 2: Item 6
   - Agent 3: Items 5 and 4

The allocations are thus balanced based on each agent's preferences, and all items are distributed.

Here’s the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```
