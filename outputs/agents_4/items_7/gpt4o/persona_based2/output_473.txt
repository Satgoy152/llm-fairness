Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  78  47  52  54  79  86
1  49  24  72  64  12  80  44
2  70  79  78  80  87  56  97
3  13  92  65  77   4  81  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuation.

Let's summarize the approach:

1. **Find the Highest Valued Items**: Allocate items based on agents' highest preferences to minimize envy.
2. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: Ensure that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

We'll proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are items 0 (92), 6 (86), and 5 (79). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are items 5 (80), 2 (72), and 3 (64). Assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are items 6 (97), 4 (87), and 3 (80). Assign item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are items 1 (92), 5 (81), and 3 (77). Assign item 1 to agent 3.

Now, consider the remaining items (2, 3, 4):

- **Item 2**: Highest unassigned value is for Agent 2 (78). Assign item 2 to agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Highest unassigned value is for Agent 2 (80). Assign item 3 to agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Highest unassigned value is for Agent 2 (87). Assign item 4 to agent 2.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "3": [1]
}
```

Each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their valuation, with Agent 2 receiving more items due to their higher valuation scores for the remaining items. This allocation attempts to minimize envy and is a fair division given the circumstances.
