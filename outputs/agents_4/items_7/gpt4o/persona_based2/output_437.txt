Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78   7  44  25  46  28  44
1  59  38   3  66  24   7  17
2  93  73  67  18  56  53  52
3  37  84  33  56  71  41  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we'll consider the valuations of each agent for every item. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for item 0 (78) and item 2 (44).
- Agent 1 values item 3 (66) the most.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0 (93) and item 1 (73).
- Agent 3 values item 1 (84) and item 4 (71) highly.

Given these observations, let's attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We'll assign item 0 (78) to Agent 0 since it's highly valued by them and less so by others after Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (66) to Agent 1, as it's their highest valuation.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 (73) to Agent 2 due to the high value they place on it.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 (71) to Agent 3 as it is highly valued by them.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2, 5, and 6).

5. **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (44) to Agent 0, as it is their next highest valued item.
6. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (53) to Agent 2. It's their next highest remaining value after item 1.
7. **Agent 3**: Assign item 6 (44) to Agent 3 as it provides a balanced allocation considering their remaining valuations.

Ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring that all items are distributed.
