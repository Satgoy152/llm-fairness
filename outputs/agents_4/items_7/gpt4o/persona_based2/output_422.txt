Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  31  95   7  88  26  91
1  47  93  77  53  66  37  75
2  56  49  76  10  52  96  62
3  58  94  69  34  96   6   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to find an allocation that is envy-free, meaning no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

We have 4 agents and 7 items. The challenge is to distribute these items in a way that respects the individual valuations and achieves a fair division.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:

#### 1. Identify High-Value Items:
We'll start by identifying which items are highly valued by each agent to ensure they receive items they find valuable.

- Agent 0: Highest value item is 2 with value 95.
- Agent 1: Highest value item is 1 with value 93.
- Agent 2: Highest value item is 5 with value 96.
- Agent 3: Highest value item is 1 with value 94.

#### 2. Initial Allocation:
Since some items are highly valued by multiple agents (e.g., item 1 by agents 1 and 3), we'll allocate items to balance out the envy. A possible starting point is:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value to Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (high value to Agent 3 and leaving Agent 1 other options).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value to Agent 2).

#### 3. Allocate Remaining Items:
Now we allocate the remaining items 0, 3, 4, and 6.

- Agent 1 can have item 4 (high value 66) and item 3 (value 53).
- Agent 0 can take item 6 (value 91, second-highest value for Agent 0).
- Agent 3 can take item 0 (value 58, which is reasonable for them).

#### 4. Final Allocation:
Ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Items 1, 0

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations and provide an envy-free distribution as much as possible given the constraints of integer allocations.
