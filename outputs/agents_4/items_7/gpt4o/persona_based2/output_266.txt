Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  36  52  14  90  59  59
1  57  77  45  56  47  36  32
2  27  57  44  82  56  37  53
3  14  68  15  32  23  19  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for a distribution that minimizes envy, meaning that each agent should perceive their allocation as at least as good as any other agent's allocation. One common method to achieve this is by using the Envy-Free Criterion, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations and try to find an allocation that distributes the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest.
4. **Agent 3** has relatively low valuations across the board compared to others.

Using these observations, we'll try to make an allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it's their highest valued item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it's their second-highest valued item.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it's their highest valued item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it's their highest valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it adds some value to Agent 2, and Agent 0 already has two highly valued items.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it provides a reasonable valuation for them.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3, as it maximizes their value given the remaining items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize the individual satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are distributed.
