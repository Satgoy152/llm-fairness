Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  85  25  99  78  17  95
1  40  64  32  73  58  54  25
2  17  24  21  28  38  18  91
3   0  69  77  42  51  94  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation, if possible. This is achieved by taking into account each agent's preferences and valuations for the items.

Here's a possible envy-free (or close to envy-free) allocation strategy for the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** seems to highly value item 3 (99) and item 1 (85). These are the highest values for these items across all agents. Thus, allocating these two items to Agent 0 is a good starting point.

2. **Agent 1** places high value on item 0 (40) and item 3 (73). Since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can give Agent 1 item 4 (58) and item 0 (40) because these are relatively high in their valuation.

3. **Agent 2** highly values item 6 (91), which is the highest value for this item across all agents. Therefore, we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for item 5 (94) and item 2 (77). Since these items haven't been allocated yet, we assign them to Agent 3.

Based on these considerations, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation strategy attempts to minimize envy by giving agents items they value highly, while making sure that each agent receives at least one item with relatively high personal valuation.
