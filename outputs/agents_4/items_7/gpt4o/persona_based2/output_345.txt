Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  11  82  38  14  56  71
1  52  15  35  63  78  24  94
2   4   2  70  97  20  28  29
3  13  74  56  83   1  47  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent should feel that they received a fair share according to their valuations.

One approach to achieve envy-freeness is to use a round-robin method, where agents take turns selecting items based on their highest valuations. However, since we need to allocate exactly 7 items, we will perform a manual allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their assigned items.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, and 6. We can assign them item 0, which they value the most.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most and also has a high valuation for item 3. We can assign them item 6.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most, followed by item 2. We can assign them item 3.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 and item 6 highly, but these are already assigned. Their next best option is item 1, so we assign them item 1.

Now, let's fill in the remaining items:

5. Agent 1 has item 6 and values item 4 next. We can assign them item 4.
6. Agent 2 already has item 3, so let's give them their second-highest remaining valued item, which is item 2.
7. Finally, the only remaining item is item 5, which we can assign to Agent 0, who also values it reasonably.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences as much as possible under the constraint of integer allocations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items to the agents, taking into account their valuations to the best extent possible.
