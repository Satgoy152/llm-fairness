Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  66  46  22  88   2  58
1  90  65  95  72  97  47  13
2  24  37  17  63   8   2  44
3  13  55  30  62  17  73  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with the goal of minimizing envy among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives a bundle that they value highly, while also ensuring that no agent envies the allocation of another agent.

Let's analyze the preferences and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (92), Item 4 (88)
   
2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (97), Item 2 (95)
   
3. **Agent 2's Preferences**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (63), Item 6 (44)
   
4. **Agent 3's Preferences**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (73), Item 3 (62)

Based on this analysis, we can attempt to allocate items by aligning the highest preferences with each agent while ensuring no conflicts in high-value items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1
  - Item 0 is their top choice, and Item 1 also has a relatively high value for them compared to others.
  
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 4
  - Item 4 is their top choice, and Item 2 is highly valued as well.
  
- **Agent 2**: Item 6
  - Item 6 is among their higher valued items.
  
- **Agent 3**: Items 3, 5
  - Item 5 is their top choice, and Item 3 is also valued highly by them.

This allocation attempt ensures that each agent receives a bundle that includes some of their highest valued items, minimizing envy.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and aims for a fair distribution with minimized envy among the agents.
