Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  81  96  32   9  48  25
1  20  60  46  22  75   8  36
2   6  56  28  99  56  95  18
3  25  63  67  27   6  58  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure an envy-free outcome where each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to the others. One approach in such scenarios is to use the method of "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW), which maximizes the product of the agents' utilities. This often results in allocations that are both efficient and envy-free up to one item.

Given the valuations provided, we'll aim to allocate the items such that each agent gets a share that reflects their preferences as fairly as possible. Let's analyze the situation and find an allocation that meets these criteria:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 and 5.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly.

Based on these observations, we can construct an allocation:

1. Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 0, as they value these items highly.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value to them compared to other agents.
3. Assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuations for these items.
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 3, as they value it significantly more than other items.

This leaves item 0, which can be allocated in a way that doesn't cause envy. Since Agent 0 has already received items 1 and 2, we can allocate item 0 to Agent 3 for balance.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they highly value, and the distribution is as balanced as possible given the constraints.
