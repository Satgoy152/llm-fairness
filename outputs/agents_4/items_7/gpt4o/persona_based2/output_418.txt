Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  36  85  63   9   0  52
1  54  82  17  72  34  14  88
2  14  79   7  67  64  72  74
3  83  32  89  11  35  97  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To approach this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy among the agents and attempts to balance their perceived value of the assigned items. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free" allocation principle, where each agent should feel that their bundle of items is at least as good as what any other agent has received.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 2, so we should consider allocating it to them. However, agent 3 values it even more, and since agent 3's other high-value items are not as high, we might want to prioritize agent 3 for item 2. Instead, agent 0 can have items 3 and 4, as their combined value matches what they value in item 2 more than other agents value them.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 6 the most, so this item should be allocated to them.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2's highest value is for item 5, and since no other agent values item 5 as highly as agent 2 does, it is suitable to allocate this item to them.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 should get item 2 because they value it the most across all agents. Additionally, they highly value item 5, but since agent 2 has a stronger preference for it, agent 3 can be allocated items 0 and 1 instead, which they value considerably.

After this allocation, let's ensure all items are allocated and each agent's allocation aligns with their highest valued preferences:

- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [0, 1, 2]

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value among the agents while ensuring each agent is content according to their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
