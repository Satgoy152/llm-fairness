Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  20  99  45  33  98  97
1  22  19  23   6  43  90  12
2  31  52  52  27  14  72  13
3  45  91  12  84   9   8  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, which is a simple yet effective strategy in many fair division problems. Here, I'll use a priority-based method, taking turns to pick the most valued item that is still available, ensuring that each agent gets a fair opportunity to choose items they value most.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Determine Initial Picks:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (99).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (90).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most (52).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (91), but since it's already taken by agent 2, the next highest is item 0 (45).

2. **Subsequent Picks:**
   - Agent 0: After item 2, the next highest value is item 6 (97).
   - Agent 1: After item 5, the next highest value is item 4 (43).
   - Agent 2: After item 1, the next highest value is item 5 (72), but it's already taken, so item 3 (27) is chosen.
   - Agent 3: After item 0, the next highest value is item 3 (84), but it's already taken, so item 6 (71) is chosen, but it's already taken, so item 4 (9) is chosen.

3. **Reallocation to Ensure All Items are Allocated:**
   - Ensure that each agent can get an item if possible, and adjust based on any remaining unallocated items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 5 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to be fair based on the highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
