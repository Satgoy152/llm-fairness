Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82   3  99  32  11  65  74
1  13  25  77  36  42  90  11
2  98  26  36  25  17  47  72
3  83  80  10  52  30  30  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly while considering envy-freeness, we can use a method called the "round-robin" allocation, which attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. This method is often employed when we want to ensure no one is overly envious based on their valuations.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Order of Picking**: We will allow each agent to take turns picking their most valued item that is still available. We can decide the order of picking randomly or based on some criteria. For simplicity, let's assume the order of picking is 0, 1, 2, 3, and then repeat the sequence until all items are allocated.

2. **Agent 0** picks:  
   - Item 2 (value 99)

3. **Agent 1** picks:  
   - Item 5 (value 90)

4. **Agent 2** picks:  
   - Item 0 (value 98)

5. **Agent 3** picks:  
   - Item 1 (value 80)

6. **Agent 0** picks again:  
   - Item 6 (value 74)

7. **Agent 1** picks again:  
   - Item 4 (value 42)

8. **Agent 2** picks again:  
   - Item 3 (value 25)

Now, each agent has picked items based on their preferences, and all items are allocated. Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items according to their preferences, minimizing envy to the best extent possible given the constraints of integer allocations.
