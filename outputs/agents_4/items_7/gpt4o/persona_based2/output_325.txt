Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  31   7  39  46  85  56
1  72  65   4  72  17  13  61
2  66  94  36  62  48  17  39
3  53   8  64  21  88  50  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 94 36 62 48 17 39]
 [53  8 64 21 88 50 77]]
Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own, given their valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuation matrix:

```
Agent \ Item   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0              28  31   7  39  46  85  56
1              72  65   4  72  17  13  61
2              66  94  36  62  48  17  39
3              53   8  64  21  88  50  77
```

Let's use the "Greedy Algorithm" for a fair division which prioritizes items based on maximum valuations. We will iterate over each item, assigning it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (72).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (94).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (64).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (72 again, but we've already allocated an item to each agent except Agent 0).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (88).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (85).
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (77 again, but we've already allocated enough items).

Revised allocation to ensure all agents get their fair share:
- Agent 0: Items 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 1
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4, 6

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and for some items, where multiple allocations are possible, we try to balance the assignment to keep it as envy-free as possible.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
