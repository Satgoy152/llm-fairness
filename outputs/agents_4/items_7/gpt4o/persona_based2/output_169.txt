Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  80  25  90  85   8  69
1  98  50  53  46  36  89  37
2  34  34   4  93  55  66  95
3  56  21  91  19  53  94  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, based on their individual valuations.

Given the valuations of the agents for each item, a reasonable approach is to use an iterative process, such as the round-robin algorithm, or the envy-graph algorithm, which ensures that each agent is assigned items in a way that minimizes envy.

Let's proceed with a possible allocation:

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 3 (90) and 1 (80), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (98), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 highly values items 6 (95) and 3 (93), but item 3 is already taken, so allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 highly values items 6 (96) and 5 (94), but item 6 is already taken, so allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Allocate item 4 (85) as it is still a high value for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 2 (53) as it is a reasonably valued item for Agent 1.
   - Agent 2: Allocate item 1 (34) as it is a reasonable value for Agent 2, and no higher preference is available.

### Final Allocation

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items that are of relatively high value to them, minimizing envy among the agents.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the distribution of items according to their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives items they value, thus minimizing potential envy.
