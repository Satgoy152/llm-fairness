Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  84   7  37  40  14   7
1  17  11   5  37  93  89   6
2   5  73   7   3  75  16  17
3  42  96  48  63  58   5  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 96 48 63 58  5 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation given their preferences. We'll try to allocate the items such that no agent feels envious of another's bundle if possible, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [97, 84, 7, 37, 40, 14, 7]
Agent 1: [17, 11, 5, 37, 93, 89, 6]
Agent 2: [5, 73, 7, 3, 75, 16, 17]
Agent 3: [42, 96, 48, 63, 58, 5, 21]
```

Let's try to allocate these items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 1** also values item 5 highly, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 2** values item 6 highly, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
6. **Items 2 and 3** are left:
   - **Agent 3** values item 3 more than other agents, so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
   - **Agent 3** also values item 2 more than other agents, so allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated all 7 items. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the highest value preferences of each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
