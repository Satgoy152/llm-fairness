Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  52  77  82  42  65  93
1  68  53  39  35  94   3  43
2  92  82  20  78  76  76  66
3  21  34  28   9   6  91  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we'll aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent should be at least as happy with their own allocation as with any other agent's allocation. However, given the constraints and discrete nature of the problem, it might not be possible to achieve perfect envy-freeness. We will try to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly, balancing the total value received by each agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (93) and also places high value on items 3 (82) and 2 (77).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (94) and has moderate valuations for other items.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (92) and item 1 also highly (82).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (91) and item 6 relatively high (78).

We will try to allocate the items according to these preferences, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 6 (highest value for agent 0), 2
- Agent 1: Items 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: Items 5, 3

This allocation considers the highest preferences of each agent as much as possible while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```
