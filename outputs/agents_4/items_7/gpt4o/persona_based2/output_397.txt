Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  13  76  93  11  11  13
1  79  13  99  84   0  94  87
2  29  22  12  19  77   9  86
3  90  68  33  12  61  15  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that attempts to minimize envy and ensure a fair division, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuations for each agent. This involves assigning items based on the highest value an agent assigns to them, while also trying to ensure that each agent receives a balanced share of the total value.

Let's go through each agent and determine which items they value most, making sure no item is allocated to more than one agent and all items are allocated.

### Step 1: Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (value 93)
   - Next highest: Item 2 (value 76)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (value 99)
   - Next highest: Item 5 (value 94)
   - Next highest: Item 6 (value 87)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (value 77)
   - Next highest: Item 6 (value 86)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value 90)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (value 68)

### Step 2: Resolve Conflicts and Complete Allocation

1. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (99). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 3**: 
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value 93).

3. **Item 5 and Item 6**: 
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 94).
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (value 86).

4. **Item 4**: 
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 77).

5. **Item 0 and Item 1**: 
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 3 (value 90).
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3 (value 68).

### Final Allocation

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [4, 6]
- Agent 3: [0, 1]

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's top preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
