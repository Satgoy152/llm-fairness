Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  20  71  15  29  28  61
1  12  31  49  91  85  58  13
2  65  48  83  34  53  25  65
3  83  35  25  73  84  33  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and integer allocations, we can apply the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This method attempts to maximize the product of the utilities (valuations) each agent receives from their allocated items, which often leads to allocations that are both efficient and envy-free.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 2 the most (value = 71).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 3 the most (value = 91).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 2 the most (value = 83), but since it is already allocated, we consider item 0 (value = 65) or item 6 (value = 65).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 the most (value = 83), but since it is already allocated, we consider item 4 (value = 84).

We allocate items based on these preferences and ensure all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Give item 2.
- **Agent 1**: Give item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Give items 0 and 6.
- **Agent 3**: Give items 1, 4, and 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, minimizing envy and maximizing overall welfare.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
