Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  70  46   0  73   4  96
1  17  12  35  59  20  29  94
2  30  38  27  20  54  49  48
3  97  13  40   0  25  42  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a challenging problem, especially in discrete settings, but we can attempt to minimize envy by considering agents' valuations for each item and ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Let's review the valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0: [47, 70, 46, 0, 73, 4, 96]
- Agent 1: [17, 12, 35, 59, 20, 29, 94]
- Agent 2: [30, 38, 27, 20, 54, 49, 48]
- Agent 3: [97, 13, 40, 0, 25, 42, 35]

Based on these valuations, we can attempt to create an allocation that minimizes envy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 4, and 6. However, to balance the distribution, we can prioritize item 6 for them due to its highest value.

2. **Agent 1** values item 3 highly and item 6, but since item 6 is already prioritized for Agent 0, we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most, so we allocate it to them.

4. **Agent 3** has an extremely high valuation for item 0, so we allocate it to them.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items, considering the next highest valuations for the agents who haven't received their highest valued items:

- **Agent 0** can also be allocated item 1, which they value relatively high.
- **Agent 1** will take item 5, as they have a moderate valuation for it.
- **Agent 2** will be assigned item 2, which is their next highest valued item after 4.
- **Agent 3** will take item 1, since it is not yet allocated and they have a moderate valuation for it.

To ensure all items are distributed, we adjust slightly:

- **Agent 0**: [6, 1]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [4, 2]
- **Agent 3**: [0]

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
