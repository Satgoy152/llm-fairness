Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  91  27  14  26  63  14
1  69  40   6   1  20  10  64
2  16   0  91  72  30  34  42
3  94  84  35  14  51  29  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to achieve a division where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations, and ideally, the allocation should strive for envy-freeness or at the very least, minimize envy.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  91  27  14  26  63  14
1  69  40   6   1  20  10  64
2  16   0  91  72  30  34  42
3  94  84  35  14  51  29  39
```

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Allocate high-value items first:** Start by allocating items to the agents who value them the most. This minimizes envy as much as possible.

2. **Consider overall value:** Ensure that each agent receives a reasonable total value from their allocated items.

3. **Balance the allocation:** Try to balance the number of items each agent receives, while keeping the value in mind.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 1, so we allocate these to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 6, so we allocate this to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 2, so we allocate this to Agent 2.
- **Agent 2** also highly values item 3, so we allocate this to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 4, so we allocate this to Agent 3.
- **Agent 0** values item 5 significantly, so we allocate this to Agent 0.
- **Agent 3** can take item 5 or another remaining item, but since Agent 0 already has it, let's give item 5 to Agent 0 and allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

To ensure all items are allocated and agents receive a fair share, the final allocation can be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest valuations and attempts to balance the distribution of items and overall satisfaction.
