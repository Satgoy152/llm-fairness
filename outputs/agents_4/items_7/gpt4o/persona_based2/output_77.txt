Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  60   1  81  16   6  10
1  64  82  72  96  88  20  80
2  92  76  10  61  76  79  73
3  40  63  82  74  92  36  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that we have 4 agents and 7 items, each agent should ideally get around 1 or 2 items.

We'll use a fair division approach to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (81), Item 0 (60), Item 1 (60)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (96), Item 4 (88), Item 6 (80)
   - Item 3 is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (92), Item 5 (79), Item 4 (76)
   - Items 0 and 4 are already taken.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (92), Item 2 (82), Item 3 (74)
   - Item 4 is already taken.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 6) among the agents:

- **Agent 1**: 
   - Next highest valuation: Item 6 (80)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest valuation: Item 1 (60)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

Finally, we check the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 4 and 6
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 2

This distribution ensures that each agent gets a share according to their preferences, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2]
}
```
