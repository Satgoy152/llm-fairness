Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  44  88  19  13   6  74
1  71  36  31  48  30  76   5
2  71   7  42  48  49  12  17
3  47  10  22  44   8  36  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the principle of envy-freeness, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Sum the values each agent assigns to all items.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**: Allocate each item to the agent that values it the most.

3. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**: If any agent feels envious of the allocation of another agent, make adjustments to balance the perceived value among agents.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 35 + 44 + 88 + 19 + 13 + 6 + 74 = 279
- Agent 1: 71 + 36 + 31 + 48 + 30 + 76 + 5 = 297
- Agent 2: 71 + 7 + 42 + 48 + 49 + 12 + 17 = 246
- Agent 3: 47 + 10 + 22 + 44 + 8 + 36 + 73 = 240

Now, allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (Value: 71)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (Value: 44)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (Value: 88)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (Value: 48)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (Value: 49)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (Value: 76)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (Value: 74)

Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: []

At this point, Agent 3 has not received any items. To adjust for envy-freeness, we need to make sure no agent envies another agent's allocation. A simple adjustment could be to transfer an item from an over-allocated agent to Agent 3.

Since Agent 0 and Agent 1 have the most items, we can transfer an item from one of them to Agent 3. Let's transfer Item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 3.

Now the allocation is:
- Agent 0: [1, 2]
- Agent 1: [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [6]

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and adjusts for envy-freeness by ensuring Agent 3 receives an item.
