Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  47  52  41  83  10  55
1  29  42  40  78  97   0  92
2  90  14  79  33  99  17  92
3  49  93  15  26  90  52  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division where no agent should feel that another agent has received a more valuable set of items based on their own valuations. Given the constraints, we have to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's approach this by examining each agent's preferences and attempting to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations. We will try to maximize each agent's satisfaction by choosing items that they value highly and ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0 Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (83), Item 0 (80)

2. **Agent 1 Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (97), Item 3 (78)

3. **Agent 2 Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (99), Item 0 (90)

4. **Agent 3 Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (93), Item 4 (90)

Given these preferences, we should consider the most valued items and try to distribute them in a way that minimizes envy:

- **Item 4:** Highly valued by all agents but valued most by Agent 2. Allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 0:** Highly valued by Agents 0 and 2, give to Agent 0 since Agent 2 got item 4.
- **Item 1:** Most valued by Agent 3. Allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 3:** Allocate to Agent 1 as it's their second highest valued item.
- **Item 2:** Allocate to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it more than other unallocated items.
- **Item 5:** Allocate to Agent 3 as they have not received many items yet.
- **Item 6:** Allocate to Agent 1, as it is their third highest valued item.

After this allocation, we can summarize the distribution as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to respect each agent's individual valuations to achieve as much fairness as possible given the constraints.
