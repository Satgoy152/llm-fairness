Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  10   3  19  28  82  58
1  36  45  62  12  18  75  64
2  35  65  80  37  43  81  11
3  38  12  79  97  69   2  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle, to the extent possible. Given the valuations, one approach is to use an algorithm that attempts to maximize the minimum satisfaction level across all agents.

One way to proceed is as follows:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation:** Start by assigning items to the agent that values them the most, ensuring no agent is significantly worse off than others.
2. **Assign Remaining Items:** Distribute remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives, minimizing envy.

From the provided valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly (82).
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly (62).
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly as well (80), but let's assign item 2 to Agent 1, and Agent 2 can get item 1 (65) which is also highly valued.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3 (97).

By assigning items based on these observations:

- **Agent 0:** Assign item 5 (82).
- **Agent 1:** Assign item 2 (62).
- **Agent 2:** Assign item 1 (65).
- **Agent 3:** Assign item 3 (97).

Now, distribute the remaining items to balance the total value:

- **Remaining Items:** 0, 4, 6
- **Agent 0:** Could get item 6 (58), which they value highly.
- **Agent 1:** Could get item 0 (36), which they value moderately.
- **Agent 3:** Could get item 4 (69), which they value highly.

Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [5, 6]
- **Agent 1:** Items [2, 0]
- **Agent 2:** Items [1]
- **Agent 3:** Items [3, 4]

This allocation attempts to balance value across agents while giving priority to high valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
