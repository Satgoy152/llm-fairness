Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  71  63  87  15  92  89
1   8  53  70  99  49   0  30
2   6  47  46  31  65  69  73
3  91   5  88  92  74  16  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation of the items among the four agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and try to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy. Given that we have 4 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive only 1 item, while the others will receive 2 items each.

To find a fair allocation, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify the most valued items for each agent:** Start by identifying which items are most valuable to each agent and try to allocate them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction.

2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one highly valued item:** Make sure each agent receives at least one item from their list of highly valued items.

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance envy:** Distribute the remaining items in a way that minimizes envy among agents.

Considering these principles, here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Values items 0, 3, and 5 highly.
- **Agent 1:** Values items 3 and 2 highly.
- **Agent 2:** Values items 6 and 5 highly.
- **Agent 3:** Values items 0, 3, and 2 highly.

Based on these insights, we try to allocate as follows:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by Agent 0 and Agent 3, but Agent 0 has a higher valuation.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it is the highest valued item for Agent 1, and Agent 1 has the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it is the most valued by Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3, as it's highly valued by Agent 3.

This leaves us with items 1, 4, and 5. We distribute them considering the highest remaining valuations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

This distribution provides each agent with at least one item they highly value, which should help in reducing envy. Below is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, while also ensuring all items are allocated.
