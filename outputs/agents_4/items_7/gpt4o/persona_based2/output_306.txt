Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  40  60   2   0  59  25
1  74  41  53  85  62  16  55
2   9   3  58   4  95  38  53
3  94   1  29  54   9  11  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the notion of maximizing the sum of valuations while ensuring that no agent envies another agent's allocation. The goal is to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as another, possibly better.

Let's start by examining each agent's highest valuation for the items and allocate based on their preferences, trying to balance the overall satisfaction.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (value 60), Item 5 (value 59).
   - Let's assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (value 85), Item 0 (value 74).
   - Let's assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (value 95), Item 2 (value 58) which is already taken.
   - Let's assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (value 94), Item 6 (value 59).
   - Let's assign Item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items, trying to balance the allocations:

5. **Remaining Items**: 1, 5, 6
   - Agent 0 has Item 2.
   - Agent 1 has Item 3.
   - Agent 2 has Item 4.
   - Agent 3 has Item 0.

6. **Allocate Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 40.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 41 (highest).
   - Agent 2 values Item 1 at 3.
   - Agent 3 values Item 1 at 1.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

7. **Allocate Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 5 at 59 (highest).
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

8. **Allocate Item 6**:
   - Agent 2 values Item 6 at 53.
   - Agent 3 values Item 6 at 59 (highest).
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 3.

With this allocation, each agent gets items based on their preferences, and we aim to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
