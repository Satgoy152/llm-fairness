Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  18  65  22  54   4  30
1  46  51  46  57  57  73  50
2   0  93  97  10  76  34   7
3  88  97  29  23  21  15  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 97 29 23 21 15 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that the distribution is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  18  65  22  54   4  30
1  46  51  46  57  57  73  50
2   0  93  97  10  76  34   7
3  88  97  29  23  21  15  66
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest among all agents (97), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest among all agents (97), so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest among all agents (73), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest among all agents (54), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
5. For the remaining items, consider the next highest valuations:
   - **Agent 3** has high value for item 0 (88), allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
   - **Agent 1** has high value for item 6 (50), allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
   - **Agent 0** has high value for item 3 (22), allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

After assigning these items, let's verify if the allocation is fair by considering each agent's preference and ensuring no agent envies another:

- Agent 0 receives items [4, 3].
- Agent 1 receives items [5, 6].
- Agent 2 receives item [2].
- Agent 3 receives items [1, 0].

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```
