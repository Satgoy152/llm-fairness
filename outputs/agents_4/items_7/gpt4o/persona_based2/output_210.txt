Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  87  88  96  28  78  56
1  10  85  92  36  75  36  74
2  65   3  94  99  37  24  80
3  22  98  36  80  60  98  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We could use a fair division algorithm such as the "Envy-Free Cake-Cutting" approach, but since we're dealing with discrete items and integer allocations, we need to make sure each agent's allocation optimizes their satisfaction given the other allocations.

### Strategy
1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Each agent has certain items they value the most. We should aim to allocate these items to them if it doesn't cause significant envy.
2. **Ensure Fairness**: Aim for a balance where each agent feels they've received a fair share based on their valuations.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued items for Agent 0 are items 3 (96) and 2 (88). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: For Agent 1, the highest valued items are 2 (92) and 1 (85). Since item 2 is highly valued by multiple agents, assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 3 (99), which is already assigned. Next high is item 2 (94), assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued items are item 1 (98) and item 5 (98). Since item 1 is assigned, assign item 5 to Agent 3.

After assigning the most valued items, we continue with the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0**: Has only item 3 which is highly valued, assign item 0 (30) next highest to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 (75) as the next highest to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 (80) as the next highest to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation
After following the above strategy, all items have been allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
``` 

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive based on their individual valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated.
