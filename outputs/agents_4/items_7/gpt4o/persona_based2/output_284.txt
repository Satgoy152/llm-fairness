Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  52   2  47  91  13  14
1  54  46  74  92  20  14  64
2   1  73  30  43  72  91  40
3  66  80  59  36   0   8  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a strategy where each agent receives at least one item they value highly, trying to balance the overall value each agent perceives from their allocation. Let's proceed with the allocation process:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (91)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 3 (92)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 5 (91)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value: Item 6 (97)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 1, 2) among the agents to balance the allocation:

5. **Remaining Items**: 0, 1, 2

   - Item 0:
     - Agent 0 has the highest value for Item 0 (85).
     - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

   - Item 1:
     - Agent 3 has the highest value for Item 1 (80).
     - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.

   - Item 2:
     - Agent 1 has the highest value for Item 2 (74).
     - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items they value, reducing potential envy among them.
