Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  56  19  58  78   7  62
1  28  53  76   5  33  42  81
2  74   9  37  95  16  97  56
3  96  29  73  94  10  77  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 53 76  5 33 42 81]
 [74  9 37 95 16 97 56]
 [96 29 73 94 10 77 21]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items. A common method for achieving fair division is to use the envy-free algorithm, which ensures no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the table of valuations, let's try to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences. We will aim to minimize envy among the agents while making sure each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Valuations Matrix:
- Agent 0: [39, 56, 19, 58, 78, 7, 62]
- Agent 1: [28, 53, 76, 5, 33, 42, 81]
- Agent 2: [74, 9, 37, 95, 16, 97, 56]
- Agent 3: [96, 29, 73, 94, 10, 77, 21]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuation is for item 4 (78).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 6 (81).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 5 (97).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuation is for item 0 (96).

Now, let's re-evaluate the remaining items:
- Remaining items: 1, 2, 3

5. **Agent 3:** Next highest valuation is for item 3 (94).
6. **Agent 0:** Next highest valuation is for item 1 (56).
7. **Agent 1:** Next highest valuation is for item 2 (76).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item they value highly, thereby minimizing envy among agents.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, aiming to achieve an envy-free distribution, given the constraints of integer allocations.
