Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  90  14  65  88  90  22
1  93  71  52  22  87   5  88
2  15  84  15  65  62  62  35
3  37  56  14  18  82  16  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[46 90 14 65 88 90 22]
 [93 71 52 22 87  5 88]
 [15 84 15 65 62 62 35]
 [37 56 14 18 82 16 49]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives a reasonable number of items based on their valuations. One way to approach this is to use the "Envy-Free" concept, aiming to ensure that no agent prefers another agent’s allocation to their own.

Given the valuations, one possible allocation strategy is to use a greedy algorithm while considering fairness. Here’s a reasonable allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1 (value 90)
   - Item 3 (value 65)
   - Item 2 (value 14)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0 (value 93)
   - Item 6 (value 88)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 (value 62)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 5 (value 16)

This allocation considers the highest individual valuations for some items while ensuring that each agent receives some items. Notably, Agent 2 and Agent 3 receive fewer items but still receive items they value more relatively. This isn't a perfect envy-free allocation, but it respects the individual high valuations given the constraints.

Now, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 2],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
