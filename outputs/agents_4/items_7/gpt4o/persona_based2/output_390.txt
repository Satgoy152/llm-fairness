Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  84  63  42  48  11  45
1  73   9  23  17   9  14  58
2  44  94  78  62   3  93  13
3  36  33  84   2  77   8  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73  9 23 17  9 14 58]

 [36 33 84  2 77  8 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an envy-free allocation approach. One well-known method for achieving such an allocation is the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" method, where agents take turns picking their most preferred available item. This helps ensure that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, minimizing envy.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [68, 84, 63, 42, 48, 11, 45]
Agent 1: [73, 9, 23, 17, 9, 14, 58]
Agent 2: [44, 94, 78, 62, 3, 93, 13]
Agent 3: [36, 33, 84, 2, 77, 8, 48]
```

Let's perform a round-robin allocation:

1. **Agent 0** starts by picking item 1 (value 84).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 0 (value 73).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 5 (value 93).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 2 (value 84).

For the second round:

5. **Agent 0** picks item 6 (value 45).
6. **Agent 1** picks item 3 (value 17).
7. **Agent 2** picks item 4 (value 3).

Now, all items have been allocated, and each agent has received a fair share considering their preferences. Let's format the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that, to the extent possible, maximizes their individual valuation, while remaining fair and envy-free.
