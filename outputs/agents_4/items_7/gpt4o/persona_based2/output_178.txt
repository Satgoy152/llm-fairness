Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  49  25  23  92  87  26
1  27   2  19  64   4  98  51
2   3  96  35  13  66  99  22
3  79  91   3  55   7  45  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraints and the valuations:

Let's examine a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Highest values are for items 0, 4, 5 (94, 92, 87).

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Highest value is for item 5 (98).

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**
   - Highest value is for item 5 (99).

4. **Agent 3's Valuations:**
   - Highest values are for items 1 and 0 (91, 79).

By trying to allocate items while maximizing each agent's happiness and reducing envy, we consider the following allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 5).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they highly value, minimizing potential envy. 

Here's the resulting allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences and ensures all items are distributed among the agents.
