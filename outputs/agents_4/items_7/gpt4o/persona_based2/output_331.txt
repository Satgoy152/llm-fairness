Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  32  61  91  25  97  30
1  88  99  40  19  49  11   8
2  77  96  21  48  66  53  14
3  18  91  73  79  18  54  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, our goal is to allocate all 7 items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

First, let's summarize the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [51, 32, 61, 91, 25, 97, 30]
- Agent 1: [88, 99, 40, 19, 49, 11, 8]
- Agent 2: [77, 96, 21, 48, 66, 53, 14]
- Agent 3: [18, 91, 73, 79, 18, 54, 48]

Given these valuations, a good starting point is to maximize each agent's total valuation by assigning items for which they have the highest relative preference among all agents. This can help achieve envy-freeness.

Next, we can systematically consider each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most. Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 88.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 also values it the most at 99.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 61.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 66.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 48.

Now, let's assign these items accordingly:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 6.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items for which they have relatively high valuations, reducing the chances of envy.

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
