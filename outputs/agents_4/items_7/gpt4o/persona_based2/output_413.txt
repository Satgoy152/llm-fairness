Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  78  19  65  38  44  74
1  93  11  69  89  59   7   2
2  14  45  58  69  76  15  34
3   7  36  79  46  78  59  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Look for items that have the highest valuation for each agent compared to others.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High Value**: Initially allocate items that are clearly more valued by one agent over others to that agent.

3. **Iterative Adjustment and Balance**: Adjust the allocation so that each agent gets a fair share, trying to minimize the total envy.

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0 highly values item 0 (value 90) and item 1 (value 78), which are both higher than any other agent's valuation for these items.
- Agent 1 values item 3 (value 89) significantly higher than others.
- Agent 2 values item 4 (value 76) higher than others.
- Agent 3 values item 2 (value 79) higher than others.

Next, we allocate based on these high values:

- Give item 0 and item 1 to agent 0.
- Give item 3 to agent 1.
- Give item 4 to agent 2.
- Give item 2 to agent 3.

Now we have allocated 5 items. There are 2 items left (5 and 6), and we need to allocate them fairly.

- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 59).
- Item 6 has a relatively low value across the board, but agent 0 values it the most at 74.

Based on these observations, we can allocate items 5 and 6 as follows:
- Give item 5 to agent 3.
- Give item 6 to agent 0.

This allocation attempts to give each agent their most valued items where feasible, distributing the rest to balance the allocations.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that:

- Agent 0 receives items with their highest valuations: 0, 1, and 6.
- Agent 1 receives item 3, which they value significantly.
- Agent 2 receives item 4, which is their highest value.
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 5, which are among their highest values.
