Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  18  14   2  83  86  26
1  94  96  62  50  64  73  86
2  72  44  36  53  90  97  26
3  67   9  19  71  33  95  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the problem of fairly allocating the items to the agents, we can consider a method that aims to minimize envy among agents. One potential approach is using an envy-free algorithm, such as the "round-robin" method, which can help in assigning items based on agents' preferences.

To implement this, we start by assigning items to agents in a sequence, with each agent picking the most valuable remaining item according to their valuation. We will iterate over the agents and assign items based on their highest value until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 1 (value 96)
2. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 5 (value 86)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 5, but it's already taken. Next is item 6 (value 26)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 5, but it's already taken. Next is item 3 (value 71)

After the first round, items 1, 5, 6, and 3 are allocated.

Proceeding with the next round:

5. **Agent 1**: Next highest available item is 0 (value 94)
6. **Agent 0**: Next highest available item is 4 (value 83)
7. **Agent 2**: Next highest available item is 2 (value 36)

Now, all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.
