Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  16   2  54  16  36  56
1  71   4  97  82  99  90  59
2  22  67  92  60  99  36  98
3  27   6  94  17  23  79   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To tackle this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents in a manner that attempts to be as fair as possible, given the valuations. A common approach is to use an envy-free allocation method where each agent values their allocation at least as highly as they value the allocation of any other agent.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 64 + 16 + 2 + 54 + 16 + 36 + 56 = 244
   - Agent 1: 71 + 4 + 97 + 82 + 99 + 90 + 59 = 502
   - Agent 2: 22 + 67 + 92 + 60 + 99 + 36 + 98 = 474
   - Agent 3: 27 + 6 + 94 + 17 + 23 + 79 + 3 = 249

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (64), Item 3 (54), Item 6 (56)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (97), Item 4 (99), Item 5 (90)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (99), Item 2 (92), Item 6 (98)
   - Agent 3: Item 5 (79), Item 2 (94)

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - We attempt to allocate items so that each agent receives some of their highest valued items, and no agent envies another.

4. **Iterate and Adjust:**
   - We may need to adjust to ensure all items are allocated and no agent receives more than one additional item than any other agent.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** We will allocate items 0 and 6. These are two of the higher value items for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** We will allocate items 2 and 4. These are the highest value items for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** We will allocate item 5. This is a high-value item for Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** We will allocate items 1 and 3. These allocations ensure Agent 3 receives items and balances the distribution.

This allocation seeks to balance the total value perceived by each agent and minimize envy, while ensuring each item is allocated.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
