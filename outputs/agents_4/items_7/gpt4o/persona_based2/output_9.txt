Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  28   1  46   4  73  18
1  89   7  70  68  26   3  79
2  93  97  20  99  91  98  55
3  40  68  56  80  82  83  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a fair manner, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, which means that each agent should prefer their own bundle of items over any other agent's bundle. We'll also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the valuations provided, we can use a method like the maximum sum assignment or other combinatorial allocation methods to achieve an envy-free allocation. However, since perfect envy-freeness is often difficult to achieve, we will aim for a solution that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Here is one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: [0, 5]
   - Value: 74 (Item 0) + 73 (Item 5) = 147

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: [2, 6]
   - Value: 70 (Item 2) + 79 (Item 6) = 149

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: [1, 3]
   - Value: 97 (Item 1) + 99 (Item 3) = 196

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: [4]
   - Value: 82 (Item 4)

This allocation attempts to distribute the items fairly based on the agents' valuations, minimizing overall envy. Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents. Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives.
