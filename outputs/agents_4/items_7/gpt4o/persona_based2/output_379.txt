Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  94   6  82  76  80  92
1  49  70  88  82  83  92  39
2  11  18  80   5  31  51  51
3  59  17  51  65  95  25  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the "adjusted winner procedure" or a similar approach to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. Here, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items while keeping the allocation as envy-free as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (94), 0 (93), 6 (92)
   - Allocate items: 0, 1

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (92), 2 (88), 4 (83)
   - Allocate items: 2, 5

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (80), 5 (51), 6 (51)
   - Allocate item: 6

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (95), 3 (65), 0 (59)
   - Allocate item: 3, 4

By this allocation, each agent receives items close to their highest valuations, and all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are among their most valued, reducing the potential for envy.
