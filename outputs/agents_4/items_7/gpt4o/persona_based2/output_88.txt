Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86   2   2  10  65  53  41
1  80  40  73  74  97  77  28
2  52  28  94  49   7  36  74
3  45  64   3  33  34  88  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare or ensuring that the allocation is envy-free to the degree possible. Given the valuations, let's attempt to create an allocation that considers the highest value for each agent while aiming for minimal envy.

1. **Maximizing Individual Valuations:**
   - Each agent should receive items that they value relatively highly compared to others to ensure they are as satisfied as possible.

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 4 and 3.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2.
   - Agent 3 highly values item 5 and 6.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because it's their highest value.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 because it's their highest value and relatively lower value for others.
   - Assign items 4 and 3 to Agent 1 because they have high values for these items.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 3 because it's highly valued by them.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3 as well, as it complements their allocation with high value.

4. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 1 is left unallocated initially and has relatively low value across the board. Assign it to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation attempts to respect the valuation preferences as much as possible within the constraints.
