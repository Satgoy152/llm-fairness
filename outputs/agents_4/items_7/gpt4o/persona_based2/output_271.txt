Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  50  50  86  45  63  97
1  41  43  63  82  20  15  18
2  10  92  73  96  39  12  76
3  13  99  59  25  60  50  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a simple method such as the "round-robin" allocation or the "maximum marginal utility" approach. Here, I'll employ a mix of these methods to ensure that we respect the preferences as much as possible and achieve a fair allocation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Setup**: Each agent will start with no items. We will allocate items one by one based on the highest valuation that has not been taken yet.

2. **Allocating Items**:
   - **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (96). Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
   - **Item 1**: Next highest valuation is by Agent 3 (99). Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
   - **Item 0**: Next highest valuation is by Agent 0 (61). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 6**: Next highest valuation is by Agent 0 (97). Assign Item 6 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 2**: Next highest valuation is by Agent 2 (73). Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - **Item 4**: Next highest valuation is by Agent 3 (60). Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.
   - **Item 5**: Remaining item, allocate to Agent 1 since they have the lowest total valuation so far.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 4]

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation among agents and reduce envy, given the constraints of integer allocations.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and takes into account the agents' preferences as much as possible, while keeping the allocation integer-based.
