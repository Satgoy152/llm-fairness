Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  36  36   6  61  92  85
1  80  24  93  75  64  75  31
2  35  44  18  53  58   1  88
3   1   6  31  19  20  26  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents such that the division is fair. A common approach is to ensure envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - There are 4 agents and 7 items, so not every agent can receive an equal number of items.
   - We should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation based on their preferences.

2. **Agent Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 has a high value for items 4, 5, and 6.
   - Agent 1 values items 2, 3, and 0 highly.
   - Agent 2 values items 6 and 4 highly.
   - Agent 3 has relatively low valuations for all items compared to other agents.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate items based on an agent's highest valuations, trying to ensure each agent gets at least one item they value significantly.
   - Attempt to balance the total value each agent receives to minimize envy.

4. **Proposed Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 5 and 6 (values: 92, 85)
   - Agent 1: Items 2 and 3 (values: 93, 75)
   - Agent 2: Items 4 and 1 (values: 58, 44)
   - Agent 3: Item 0 (value: 1)

This allocation attempts to balance the values while ensuring each agent receives items they value highly. Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, with an attempt to maximize fairness based on the given valuations.
