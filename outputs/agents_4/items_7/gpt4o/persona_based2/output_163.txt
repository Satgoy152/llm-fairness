Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  45  68  71  77  89  75
1  34  19  89  70  55  18  25
2  50  87  30  33   7   8  97
3   6  41  11  90  18  99  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents in a way that is fair and envy-free as much as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's first summarize the problem:

- There are 4 agents: 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- There are 7 items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Each agent has a specific valuation for each item.

To find a fair allocation, we can use a method that considers the valuations and attempts to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items that maximize their utility.

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agents have different preferences for items.
   - We need to allocate exactly 7 items among the agents.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by assigning each agent their most valued item that has not been claimed by another agent.

3. **Iterative Allocation**:
   - Allocate items one by one while ensuring that assignments are as balanced as possible with respect to each agent's total valuation of their assigned items.

### Allocation

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Valuations are [20, 45, 68, 71, 77, 89, 75]. Most valued item is 5.
- **Agent 1**: Valuations are [34, 19, 89, 70, 55, 18, 25]. Most valued item is 2.
- **Agent 2**: Valuations are [50, 87, 30, 33, 7, 8, 97]. Most valued item is 6.
- **Agent 3**: Valuations are [6, 41, 11, 90, 18, 99, 96]. Most valued item is 5, but it's taken. Next highest is 3.

Assign these items first:
- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.

Remaining items: 0, 1, 4

Continue assigning remaining items, ensuring fair distribution:
- **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 4 (value 77).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest is item 0 (value 34).
- **Agent 2**: Next highest is item 1 (value 87).
- **Agent 3**: Already has an item; doesn't need another based on current allocation strategy.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences as much as possible, minimizing envy and fairly distributing the total value.
