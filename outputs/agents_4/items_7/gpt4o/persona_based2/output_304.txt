Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  48  62  64  84  80  90
1  36  99  88  87  88  13   3
2  59  99  64   5   8  97  80
3  31  58  50  86  36  18  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that ensures envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, given the constraints, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible, so our goal is to minimize envy as much as possible while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items with a strong preference for item 6 (value 90) and item 4 (value 84).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (value 99).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (value 99) and item 5 (value 97) second highest.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (value 86).

A reasonable approach is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here’s a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 since it is their highest valued item.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valued item.
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 because it has the second-highest value for them.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 because it is their highest valued item.
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since it's their next highest valued item.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as it complements their allocation well.
7. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 as it is not highly valued by any other agents and they still need another item.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by prioritizing each agent’s highest valued items while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
