Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  28  61  47  88   2  55
1   6  41  77   9  56  58  23
2  89  51  38  10   5  58  57
3  42  51  50  62  81  40  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and achieving envy-freeness, we can apply a method such as the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method. This method involves each agent taking turns to pick their most valued item from the remaining pool of items until all items are allocated. We will start with the agent with the highest valuation for any item and proceed in descending order.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the valuations:

1. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (89), so they choose item 0.
2. Agent 0 values item 4 the second highest (88), so they choose item 4.
3. Agent 1 values item 2 the third highest (77), so they choose item 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the next highest (62), so they choose item 3.
5. Agent 0 values item 6 the next highest (55), so they choose item 6.
6. Agent 2 values item 5 the next highest (58), so they choose item 5.
7. Agent 3 values item 1 the next highest (51), so they choose item 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value highly, and the distribution is envy-free in terms of individual item selection.
