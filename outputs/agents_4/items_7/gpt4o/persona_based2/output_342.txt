Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  15   9  83  82  45  22
1  72  90  71  32  30  60  47
2  36  41  61  54  60  16  68
3  20  27   2  73   2   9  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels that their share is as good as anyone else's. The table provided shows the value each agent places on each item. To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or other fair division algorithms. However, given the constraints and the need for a quick solution, I'll use a simple heuristic approach that tries to balance the total value each agent receives.

First, I will calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then attempt to allocate the items to minimize envy, ensuring each agent receives items with a high personal valuation.

### Agent's Total Valuation of All Items
- Agent 0: 303
- Agent 1: 402
- Agent 2: 336
- Agent 3: 167

### Allocation Strategy
1. Prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most, then proceed to the next highest value, ensuring no items are duplicated.
2. Attempt to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items.

### Allocation Steps
1. **Agent 0** values item 3 highly (83), followed by item 4 (82). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly (90), followed by item 0 (72). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 highly (68), followed by item 4 (60). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly (73), but it's already taken. Next is item 6 (34), but it's also taken. Then item 5 (9). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 0** can take item 4 as it's their next highest value. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** can take item 0 as it's their next highest value. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 2** can take item 2 as it's their next highest value. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation
Now, let's represent the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
