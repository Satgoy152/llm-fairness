Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  57   1  11  93  92  94
1  59  60  19  77  32   9  90
2  26  14  88  26  53  24  89
3  79  71  32  30  58  74  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 57  1 11 93 92 94]
 [59 60 19 77 32  9 90]
 [26 14 88 26 53 24 89]
 [79 71 32 30 58 74 99]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the four agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, though achieving full envy-freeness can be challenging with integer allocations. We will strive to make the allocation as balanced as possible, considering the valuations provided.

Let's first summarize the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(21 + 57 + 1 + 11 + 93 + 92 + 94 = 369\)
- Agent 1: \(59 + 60 + 19 + 77 + 32 + 9 + 90 = 346\)
- Agent 2: \(26 + 14 + 88 + 26 + 53 + 24 + 89 = 320\)
- Agent 3: \(79 + 71 + 32 + 30 + 58 + 74 + 99 = 443\)

Given these totals, we will try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that all items are distributed.

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (93), item 5 (92), and item 6 (94). Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for item 0 (59), item 1 (60), and item 3 (77). Allocating these items to Agent 1 will maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 2** values item 2 (88) the most. We will allocate this item to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items not yet allocated, such as item 6 (99). However, since Agent 6 is already allocated to another agent, we will allocate any remaining items to Agent 3 to balance the allocation.

Let's make the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [4, 5, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 1, 3]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: []

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to maximize individual agent satisfaction based on their valuations. Now, let's present it in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": []
}
```
