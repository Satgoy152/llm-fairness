Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  28  37  18   0  96  26
1  40  84  69   6  24  94  79
2  86  36  83   5  61  79  88
3  62  55  82  43  11  66  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an algorithmic approach like the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of utilities for the agents. However, given the complexity and constraints of the problem, we can also consider a simpler heuristic method to achieve a fair allocation.

The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation maximizes their own valuation while minimizing envy. We will try to distribute the items so that each agent receives items they highly value, therefore reducing potential envy.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Initial High-Value Allocations**: Allocate the highest valued item for each agent first if possible.
2. **Remaining Items Allocation**: Allocate the remaining items to agents based on the next highest valuation that hasn't been allocated yet, trying to ensure each agent gets a fair share.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (96).
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 (84).
- Agent 2 highly values item 0 (86).
- Agent 3 highly values item 2 (82).

Allocate these items first:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [2]

Remaining items: 3, 4, 6

- Item 3: Agent 3 values it at 43, which is the highest among the remaining item values.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 61, which is the highest among the remaining item values.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 88, which is the highest among the remaining item values.

Allocate these items based on highest remaining values:
- Agent 2: [0, 4, 6]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [1]

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0, 4, 6]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]

Here is the JSON representation of the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4, 6],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure each agent receives items they value highly, thus aiming to minimize envy and distribute the items fairly.
