Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  30  89  58   3  71  11
1  22  15   9  25  32  95  79
2  65  64  32  53  92  84  64
3  15   7  42  78  27  88   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is both efficient and as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is challenging in discrete allocations but we can strive for a balanced distribution based on their valuations.

Based on the given valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 89), then item 5 (value 71), and item 3 (value 58).
   - Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 5 (value 95), followed by item 6 (value 79), and item 4 (value 32).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 92), followed by item 5 (value 84) and item 0 (value 65).
   - Since item 5 is already allocated, allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 5 (value 88), followed by item 3 (value 78) and item 2 (value 42).
   - Since item 5 and 2 are allocated, allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated items 2, 5, 4, and 3. Let's allocate the remaining items 0, 1, and 6.

- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 2 (highest unallocated value for them).
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 0 (second highest unallocated value for them).
- **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 1 (second highest unallocated value for them).

The allocation ensures each agent gets items with relatively high value to them, attempting to reduce envy.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
