Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  93  75  84  61  27  84
1  81  35  81  38  80   9  47
2  47  10  19  49  28  54   2
3  18  11  26   2  51   3  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we should aim to give each agent a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's bundle to their own. This is a challenging task, especially with indivisible goods, but we can try to find a reasonable allocation based on the given valuations.

We have 4 agents and 7 items, and we need to distribute all items among the agents. Let's consider the valuations and try to balance the allocations so that agents have similar total valuations for their allocated items.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 17 + 93 + 75 + 84 + 61 + 27 + 84 = 441
- Agent 1: 81 + 35 + 81 + 38 + 80 + 9 + 47 = 371
- Agent 2: 47 + 10 + 19 + 49 + 28 + 54 + 2 = 209
- Agent 3: 18 + 11 + 26 + 2 + 51 + 3 + 16 = 127

Based on these total valuations, we aim to give more valuable bundles to agents with lower total valuations to try to balance the perceived fairness.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Give Agent 0 the items they value the most that others do not significantly value: Item 1 and Item 6.
   - Agent 0: [1, 6]

2. Give Agent 1 items with high relative value, but not those that are critical for balancing other agents: Item 0 and Item 2.
   - Agent 1: [0, 2]

3. Give Agent 2 items they value relatively more than others: Item 5.
   - Agent 2: [5]

4. Give Agent 3 the remaining items: Item 3 and Item 4.
   - Agent 3: [3, 4]

This distribution considers both the individual valuations and the total valuations to balance the allocation fairly among agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
