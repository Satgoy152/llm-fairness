Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  12  95  42  44  21  55
1  59  85  66  52  50  68  48
2  58  78  20  71  66  57  60
3  89  42  45  31  77  46  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their bundle of items is at least as good as the bundle of any other agent, based on their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step outline of how we'll approach the problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Calculate the sum of the values each agent has for all items. This will help us understand each agent's perspective on the total value.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating items to agents based on their highest individual valuations. This helps in minimizing envy.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: After an initial allocation, adjust the distribution to ensure each agent feels satisfied with their allocation relative to what others have.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent

- Agent 0: 11 + 12 + 95 + 42 + 44 + 21 + 55 = 280
- Agent 1: 59 + 85 + 66 + 52 + 50 + 68 + 48 = 428
- Agent 2: 58 + 78 + 20 + 71 + 66 + 57 + 60 = 410
- Agent 3: 89 + 42 + 45 + 31 + 77 + 46 + 23 = 353

### Step 2: Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 (89)
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 (85)
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 (95)
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 (71)
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 (77)
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 (68)
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 (60)

### Step 3: Adjust for Fairness

The initial allocation is:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 6]
- Agent 3: [0, 4]

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning the items according to their highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

Let's present the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent's allocation is based on their highest preferences, minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.
