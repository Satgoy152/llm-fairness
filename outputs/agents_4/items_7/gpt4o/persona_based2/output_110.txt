Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  87  37  61  80  40  92
1  74  26  64  85  25  51   8
2  84  91  73  54   7  74  42
3  13  40  73  71  18  62  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[14 87 37 61 80 40 92]
 [74 26 64 85 25 51  8]
 [84 91 73 54  7 74 42]
 [13 40 73 71 18 62 44]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, one approach is to use the "round robin" or "sequential picking" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued available item. We will prioritize agents based on their highest valued items and adjust to minimize envy.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (91). Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 0 highly values item 6 (92). Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 1 highly values item 3 (85). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 0 values item 4 highly (80). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 2 values item 2 highly (73). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
6. Agent 3 values item 5 (62). Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
7. Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 0 (14). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, and attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
