Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  84  77  30  53  52  60
1  22  74   6  44   3  37  26
2  92  75  68   5  14  61  12
3  88  83  38  12  73  73  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and attempt to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. A common approach to such problems is to use the Envy-Free or Max-Min method, though perfect envy-freeness may not always be possible with integer allocations. Instead, we aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible.

Given the problem, let's attempt to distribute the items among the agents by considering their highest valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, wherever possible.

**Agent Valuations:**
- Agent 0 values: [94, 84, 77, 30, 53, 52, 60]
- Agent 1 values: [22, 74, 6, 44, 3, 37, 26]
- Agent 2 values: [92, 75, 68, 5, 14, 61, 12]
- Agent 3 values: [88, 83, 38, 12, 73, 73, 35]

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value for item 0 (94)
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value for item 1 (74)
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value for item 5 (61)
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value for item 4 and 5, but already taken by Agent 2, so item 4 (73)

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2: Highest remaining value for Agent 0 (77)
- Item 3: Highest remaining value for Agent 1 (44)
- Item 6: Highest remaining value for Agent 0 (60)

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3
- Agent 2 receives items: 5
- Agent 3 receives items: 4

**JSON Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items based on their preferences, balancing between maximizing individual satisfaction and distributing the total available items.
