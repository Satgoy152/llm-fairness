Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  58   7  53  47  94  49
1  95  15  21  21  62  58  56
2  41  19  83  77  44  96  68
3  34  81  44  58  21  50  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use an approach that aims to minimize the maximum envy or dissatisfaction among agents. This involves considering the valuations of each agent for the items and distributing the items in a way that attempts to balance perceived fairness.

One heuristic method to achieve this is to use a round-robin or a max-min approach where agents pick their most valued item that hasn't been picked yet, in a sequence. Another approach is to use a greedy method to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (94).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (95).
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest but since it's already allocated, we consider the next highest, item 2 (83).
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (81).

Continuing this process, we try to allocate the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 4 (values: 94, 47)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6 (values: 95, 56)
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3 (values: 83, 77)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (value: 81)

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This distribution aims to provide a fair allocation based on the given valuations while ensuring that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their perceived value.
