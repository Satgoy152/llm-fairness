Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  10  40  18  20  19  67
1  82  89  49  67  24  87  10
2   0  62  36  68  81  69  57
3  37  68   2  93  28  19  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the four agents, we consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we'll attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives a reasonable share that maximizes their perceived value while striving for fairness.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (67), so we will allocate item 6 to them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (89), so we will allocate item 1 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (81), so we will allocate item 4 to them.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (93), so we will allocate item 3 to them.

Now, we have allocated 4 items and need to allocate the remaining 3 items (0, 2, and 5).

5. **Distributing remaining items**:
   - **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (82), so we allocate item 0 to them.
   - **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest among remaining items (40), so we allocate item 2 to them.
   - **Item 5**: Agent 2 values item 5 the highest among the remaining items (69), so we allocate item 5 to them.

This distribution attempts to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly.

Let's present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, aligning with an envy-free division as much as possible given the constraints.
