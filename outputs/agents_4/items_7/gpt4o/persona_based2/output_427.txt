Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  50  25  23  27  44  60
1  83  66  91  25  55  46  59
2  40  82  49  56  93  83  78
3  19  20  36  77  30  13  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the Envy-Free criterion, which aims to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve envy-freeness:

1. **Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 30 + 50 + 25 + 23 + 27 + 44 + 60 = 259
   - Agent 1: 83 + 66 + 91 + 25 + 55 + 46 + 59 = 425
   - Agent 2: 40 + 82 + 49 + 56 + 93 + 83 + 78 = 481
   - Agent 3: 19 + 20 + 36 + 77 + 30 + 13 + 52 = 247

2. **Determine Allocation Preferences:**
   - Identify the items with the highest value for each agent.
   - Agent 0 highly values item 6 (60).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (91).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 4 (93).
   - Agent 3 highly values item 3 (77).

3. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate the highest valued item to each agent if possible and balanced:
     - Agent 0: Item 6
     - Agent 1: Item 2
     - Agent 2: Item 4
     - Agent 3: Item 3

4. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 5
   - Allocate remaining based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent:
     - Agent 0: Item 1 (50)
     - Agent 1: Item 0 (83)
     - Agent 2: Item 5 (83)
   - This allocation ensures each agent has a high-value item, and the total allocation is balanced.

5. **Check for Envy-Freeness:**
   - Each agent should not desire another's allocation more than their own.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation is designed to be envy-free and fair by attempting to maximize each agent's total valuation and preference satisfaction.
