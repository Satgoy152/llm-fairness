Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  71  44  25  52  50  18
1  65  42  58  93  97  41  74
2  48  81  65  17  78  52  23
3  51  68  85  63  27   7  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [48 81 65 17 78 52 23]
 [51 68 85 63 27  7 33]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, which means each agent should prefer their allocation over any other agent's allocation based on their valuations. Given the constraints that each agent receives an integer number of items, we'll attempt to balance the valuations as evenly as possible.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: 5, 6
   - Total valuation: 50 (for item 5) + 18 (for item 6) = 68

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items: 3, 4
   - Total valuation: 93 (for item 3) + 97 (for item 4) = 190

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items: 1
   - Total valuation: 81 (for item 1) = 81

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items: 0, 2
   - Total valuation: 51 (for item 0) + 85 (for item 2) = 136

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives as much as possible, considering the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
