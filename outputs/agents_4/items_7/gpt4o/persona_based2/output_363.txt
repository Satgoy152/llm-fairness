Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  55  56  81  76  27  42
1  67  31  49  55  97  34  68
2  71  62  63  74  12  68  29
3  91  36  78  50  77   5  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [91 36 78 50 77  5 59]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while trying to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent should feel that another agent's allocation is better, according to their own valuation.

First, let's summarize the problem:

- 4 agents (0, 1, 2, 3)
- 7 items (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  
The table of valuations for each agent and item is as follows:

| Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 32 | 55 | 56 | 81 | 76 | 27 | 42 |
| 1          | 67 | 31 | 49 | 55 | 97 | 34 | 68 |
| 2          | 71 | 62 | 63 | 74 | 12 | 68 | 29 |
| 3          | 91 | 36 | 78 | 50 | 77 |  5 | 59 |

To achieve a fair division, we will consider each agent's valuation and try to allocate items to maximize the perceived value for each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 the highest (91). We allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the highest (97). We allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 3 the highest (81). We allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 the highest (68). We allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 6) to minimize envy.

5. **Remaining Items**: 

   - Item 1: Highest value remaining for Agent 2 (62). Allocate to Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Highest value remaining for Agent 3 (78). Allocate to Agent 3.
   - Item 6: Highest value remaining for Agent 1 (68). Allocate to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6
- Agent 2: Items 5, 1
- Agent 3: Items 0, 2

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's total value and reduce the chances of envy.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
