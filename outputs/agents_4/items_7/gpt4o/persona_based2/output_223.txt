Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  96  97  18  93  74  89
1  13  34  20  37  88  55  83
2  50  10  36  79  57  84  77
3  29  48   1  70  60  82  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. This means each agent should feel they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a potential allocation that tries to balance the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: They highly value items 1, 2, and 4. To maximize their satisfaction, we can give them items 1 and 2.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the most. Thus, we can allocate item 4 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 places high value on item 3, so we allocate item 3 to them.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 6, so we allocate item 6 to them.

For the remaining items 0 and 5, we try to distribute them such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Receives item 0 as well.
- **Agent 3**: Receives item 5 as they also value it decently.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

Each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. This allocation minimizes envy based on the given valuations.
