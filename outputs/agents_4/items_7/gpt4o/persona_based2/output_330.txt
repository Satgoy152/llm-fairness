Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  15  65  59  75  89  96
1  22  54  13  21  83  40  65
2  82  73  78  89  76   6  21
3   5  61  38  96  11  65   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [22 54 13 21 83 40 65]
 [82 73 78 89 76  6 21]
 [ 5 61 38 96 11 65  8]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we will attempt to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by any other agent to their own bundle.

Firstly, let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [76, 15, 65, 59, 75, 89, 96]
Agent 1: [22, 54, 13, 21, 83, 40, 65]
Agent 2: [82, 73, 78, 89, 76, 6, 21]
Agent 3: [5, 61, 38, 96, 11, 65, 8]
```

We will try to allocate items in such a way that each agent is satisfied with their allocation compared to what others have received. Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 6 (96) the most, so we will allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
  
- **Agent 1** values item 4 (83) the most after item 6, which is already taken, so we will allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2** values item 3 (89) the most, so we will allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

- **Agent 3** values item 3 (96) the most, but it's already taken. The second most valued item for Agent 3 is item 1 (61), so we will allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Following these initial allocations, we have:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1]

Remaining items are 0, 2, and 5. Let's allocate them:

- **Item 0** (76) is highly valued by Agent 0, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

- **Item 2** (65) is highly valued by Agent 0, but we will allocate it to Agent 3 to balance the number of items.

- **Item 5** (89) is highly valued by Agent 0, but since Agent 0 already has two items, we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [6, 0]
- Agent 1: [4, 5]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1, 2]

This allocation attempts to balance the items based on the preferences given and ensures that each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
