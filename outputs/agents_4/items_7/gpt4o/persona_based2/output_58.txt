Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  93  61  12   0  64  69
1  24  31  64  69  90  80  21
2  26  23  26  93  45  15  35
3  23  76  74  90  75  81  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that minimizes envy. This involves considering the valuations provided and trying to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the perceived value for each agent while maintaining an equitable distribution.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5. Allocating these items to agent 0 maximizes their valuation.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 4 and 5, but since item 5 is already allocated to agent 0, we give them item 4. They also have a relatively high valuation for item 3, so we can allocate that to them.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3, but since it's given to agent 1, we look at their next highest valuation, which is item 6.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 6. Considering item 1 is allocated to agent 0 and item 6 is given to agent 2, we assign item 2 to agent 3.

Based on this reasoning, here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 4
- **Agent 2**: Item 6
- **Agent 3**: Item 2, 5

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the agents, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the distribution considers their respective valuations to minimize envy as much as possible.
