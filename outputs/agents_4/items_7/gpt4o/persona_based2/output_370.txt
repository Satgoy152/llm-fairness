Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13   0  97   3  40  59   5
1  14   5  31  61  22  48  55
2  80  39  11  33  64  61  30
3  96  39  90  60  77  12  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly while taking into account the valuations of each agent, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another over their own. We have four agents and seven items, so each agent will receive at least one item, with some receiving more than one.

Given the valuations, a potential allocation could be constructed by considering the highest-valued items for each agent and ensuring that each agent gets at least one item they value highly. Let's analyze and allocate based on the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (97), followed by item 5 (59). Since item 2 is highly valued by Agent 0 and not valued as much by others, a good allocation is to give item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** has highest values for items 3 (61) and 6 (55). Item 3 is not as highly valued by other agents, so it can be allocated to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (80), followed by item 5 (61), but item 0 is not highly valued by others, so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** values item 0 highly, but it is already allocated. The next highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 4 (77), which is not particularly valued by other agents, so allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Next, distribute the remaining items 1, 5, and 6 to balance valuations fairly:

- **Item 1**: Has low valuation overall but is valued more by Agent 2 (39) than others.
- **Item 5**: Valued by Agents 2 (61) and 0 (59). Since Agent 2 already has item 0 (80), allocate item 5 to Agent 0 to balance the high value item distribution.
- **Item 6**: Valued by Agent 1 (55) and Agent 0 (5), since Agent 1 has already one item, we give item 6 also to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, while also attempting to maintain balance and fairness in the distribution.
