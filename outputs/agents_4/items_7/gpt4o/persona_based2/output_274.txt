Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  45  64  44   7  41  89
1  92  95   3  19  15  84   7
2  16  30  74  27  98  11  61
3  55  61  58  57  65  74   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16 30 74 27 98 11 61]
 [55 61 58 57 65 74  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we'll aim for an envy-free or approximately envy-free distribution. This means each agent should prefer their allocation over what any other agent receives, based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations in the table, let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to minimize envy by considering each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0's highest preferences**:
   - Item 6 (value 89)
   - Item 2 (value 64)
   - Item 1 (value 45)

2. **Agent 1's highest preferences**:
   - Item 1 (value 95)
   - Item 0 (value 92)
   - Item 5 (value 84)

3. **Agent 2's highest preferences**:
   - Item 4 (value 98)
   - Item 2 (value 74)
   - Item 6 (value 61)

4. **Agent 3's highest preferences**:
   - Item 5 (value 74)
   - Item 1 (value 61)
   - Item 4 (value 65)

Considering these preferences, we aim for a fair division:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 6 (highest value for agent 0)
  
- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0 (second highest value for agent 1)
  - Item 3 (since it's not highly valued by others and gives agent 1 an additional item)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 4 (highest value for agent 2)

- **Agent 3**:
  - Item 1 (second highest value for agent 3, but agent 1 has a higher value for it)
  - Item 5 (highest value for agent 3)

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [1, 5]

This allocation attempts to respect the preferences and minimize envy. Note that agent 2 only gets one item due to the constraints and their high valuation for item 4.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
