Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  69  87  90  21  84  16
1   3  57  61  96  63   5  52
2  91  37  73  23  23  89  59
3  33  64  12  29  14   0  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ideally achieving envy-freeness if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent to their own. Given the valuations, let's try to make the allocations as fair as possible.

Analyzing the valuations, we can attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items that they value relatively high compared to their valuations of other items.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 2, 5
   - Valuations: 87, 84

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 3, 6
   - Valuations: 96, 52

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 0, 4
   - Valuations: 91, 23

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item: 1
   - Valuation: 64

This allocation attempts to distribute the items so that each agent gets items they value highly. Now let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item they highly value, reducing potential envy.
