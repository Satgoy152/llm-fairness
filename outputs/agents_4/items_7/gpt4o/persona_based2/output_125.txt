Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  57  27  71  57  10  77
1  69  40   5  10  85  23  84
2  18   1  14  72   3   2  44
3  32  90   5  86  63  46  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Here's an approach to allocate these items:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:** 
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 69.
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 90.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 27.
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 86.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 85.
   - Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most at 46.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 77.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This initial allocation is:
     - Agent 0: Items 2, 6
     - Agent 1: Items 0, 4
     - Agent 3: Items 1, 3, 5

3. **Ensure All Agents Get Items:**
   - Agent 2 currently has no items. To ensure fairness and include all agents, we can adjust slightly by considering an item that doesn't drastically reduce the total value for other agents.

4. **Adjustment:**
   - Reassign item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 6 and will maintain a reasonable total value.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 6
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 4
   - Agent 2: Item 2
   - Agent 3: Items 1, 3, 5

This allocation attempts to respect the highest valuation preferences while ensuring all agents receive at least one item. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
