Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  16  79  39  75  74  54
1  79  81  12  86  31  62  91
2  33  48  36  69  72  25  40
3  58  17  26  48  55   6  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free or at least envy-minimized, we should aim to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their individual valuations. This can be a complex problem, especially with a small number of items and varying valuations, but we can attempt a fair distribution with the given data.

Let's analyze the valuations and assign items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values items 2 and 4 highly (79 and 75, respectively). Assign items 2 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 and item 3 the most (81 and 86). Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has a moderate valuation for item 0 and item 6 (33 and 40). Assign items 0 and 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Only item 5 remains, and Agent 3 has some valuation for it. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives, aiming for an envy-free result or minimizing any potential envy.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
