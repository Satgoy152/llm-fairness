Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  99  64  77  82  77  98
1   8  19  23  58  59  61  61
2  19  78  13   4  75  29   9
3  33  72  54  67  30   0   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent values their allocation as much as possible given the constraints.

One common approach is to use an algorithm like the "Envy-Free Matching" or "Max-Min Fairness" which try to maximize the minimum utility or ensure no agent envies another given their allocation, respectively. However, given the complexity of ensuring a perfect envy-free allocation in a discrete setting, our goal will be to make a reasonable allocation that aims to be as fair as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 6, so we allocate these to them.
- Agent 1 values a broad range of items moderately, so we allocate items 4 and 5.
- Agent 2 values item 0 relatively higher compared to others and item 3 the least, so we allocate items 0 and 3.
- Agent 3 values item 2 moderately, so we allocate item 2.

The proposed allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 6
- Agent 1: Items 4 and 5
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 3: Item 2

This allocation attempts to balance the highest values each agent assigns to the items they receive while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is that allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```
