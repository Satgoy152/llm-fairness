Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  32  13  95  80   5  31
1  34  91  41   0  60  54  81
2  22  46  24  55  90   0  26
3  59   3   6  11  83  64  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels that they have received the best possible items given the constraints. We'll use a method that involves maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's examine the valuations more closely:

- Agent 0 values items highly: 0 (58), 3 (95), 4 (80)
- Agent 1 values items highly: 1 (91), 6 (81), 5 (54)
- Agent 2 values items highly: 4 (90), 3 (55), 1 (46)
- Agent 3 values items highly: 0 (59), 4 (83), 5 (64)

Based on this, let's attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring no envy:

1. **Agent 0**: Most values for items 3 (95), 4 (80)
2. **Agent 1**: Most values for items 1 (91), 6 (81)
3. **Agent 2**: Most values for items 4 (90), 3 (55)
4. **Agent 3**: Most values for items 0 (59), 5 (64)

Now, we need to ensure that each agent gets an equal number of items or as close to equal as possible, given the constraints of the problem:

- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 6]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [0, 5]

This allocation gives us a total of 7 items allocated, keeping the envy-freeness principle in mind where possible. Let's format this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

Thus, each agent receives items as fairly as possible according to their valuations, and all items are allocated.
