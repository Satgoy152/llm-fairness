Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67   5  73  87  34  76  29
1  33  96  51   3  33   6  30
2  49  19  59  70  88  41   2
3  62  63  93  91  93  47   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their perceived value while also maintaining envy-freeness as much as possible. In this context, envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, given their individual valuations.

Let's break down the allocations based on the value each agent places on the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**  
   - Highest value items: 3 (87), 2 (73), 5 (76)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**  
   - Highest value items: 1 (96), 2 (51), 0 (33)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**  
   - Highest value items: 4 (88), 3 (70), 2 (59)

4. **Agent 3's Valuations:**  
   - Highest value items: 2 (93), 4 (93), 3 (91)

Given this breakdown, we want to assign items to maximize fairness. Here is one way to allocate these items based on their valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all 7 items are distributed:

- **Agent 0:** Item 5
- **Agent 1:** Item 1
- **Agent 2:** Items 4 and 6
- **Agent 3:** Items 0, 2, and 3

This allocation attempts to balance individual preferences while ensuring all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 5, which is among the items they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, which they value the most.
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 6, with item 4 being highly valued.
- Agent 3 receives items 0, 2, and 3, with 2 and 3 being highly valued. 

This allocation aims to balance envy-freeness and the value each agent places on the items.
