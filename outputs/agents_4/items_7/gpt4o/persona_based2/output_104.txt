Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  17  48  50  78  87  58
1  28  40   0   6  62  15  29
2   1   6  41  45  34  30  88
3  94  32  42  97  67  48  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method inspired by the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or reducing envy. A simple approach is to use the "Maximum Envy-Free Allocation" method, which attempts to balance the allocation by considering the agents' valuations.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0: [30, 17, 48, 50, 78, 87, 58]
- Agent 1: [28, 40, 0, 6, 62, 15, 29]
- Agent 2: [1, 6, 41, 45, 34, 30, 88]
- Agent 3: [94, 32, 42, 97, 67, 48, 48]

To allocate the items, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives. We aim to give each agent items that maximize their satisfaction while minimizing envy.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign the highest valued item to the agent who values it the most, as long as it doesn't create an unfair distribution.
2. Continue this process while keeping track of the total value each agent receives.

Following this approach, we get the allocation:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 97, highest).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 87, highest remaining).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 78, second highest).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 88, highest remaining).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 94, highest remaining).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 40, highest remaining).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 48, third highest).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one high-value item they value most, leading to a fair, envy-reduced distribution.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
