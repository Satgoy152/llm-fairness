Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  77  40  85  27  90  96
1  81  79  93  32   5  43  96
2  53  45  51  82  39   3  25
3   7  21  62  44  16  87  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to allocate the items so that no agent feels another agent has received a more desirable set of items.

Here's a step-by-step strategy to achieve this:

1. **Initial Setup**: Start by analyzing the valuation matrix and identifying the items which have the highest utility for each agent. This can help guide initial allocations and ensure that each agent gets at least some items of high value to them.

2. **Prioritize Highest Valuation**: Allocate items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that all items are allocated. This can be done by iteratively selecting the item that gives the highest value to any agent who hasn't reached their target allocation.

3. **Balance Allocations**: After the initial allocation, ensure that each agent has a roughly equal share of total valuation, adjusting allocations where necessary to balance out disparities.

4. **Avoid Envy**: As the allocation proceeds, check for potential envy situations where an agent may prefer another agent's allocation. Adjust the allocation to resolve any such issues, if possible.

Following this method, I propose the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [3]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent has items, and is balanced to minimize envy based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
