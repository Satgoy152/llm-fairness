Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  86  95  43  85  35  90
1  51  84  69  70  60  80  72
2  14  99  76  33  57  29  30
3  48  35  57  36  15   2  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, if possible. There are various methods to achieve this, but one intuitive approach is to do a manual allocation by considering the highest valuations of items for each agent and ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: 2 (95)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: 1 (84)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item: 1 (99) - Already allocated, next highest is item 2 (76) - Already allocated, next is item 4 (57)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value item: 0 (48)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we'll allocate the remaining items (3, 5, 6):

5. **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest available item: 6 (90)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**: 
   - Next highest available item: 5 (80)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**: 
   - Next highest available item: 3 (33)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

The allocations are now complete with each agent receiving at least one item and no more than two, ensuring all 7 items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and ensure a fair distribution based on the valuations provided.
