Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  39  45  82  30  96  36
1  91  62  53  45  18  65  73
2  84  12  46  73   7  29  97
3  44  30  37   3  54  12  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, or at least minimize envy, where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly relative to the other agents.

We need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 5 (96) highly. We can allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 (91) the most. We can allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 (97) the most. We can allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 4 (54) the most. We can allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items: 1, 2, 3.

5. **Agent 0**: We can also allocate item 3 (82) to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highly.
6. **Agent 1**: We can allocate item 1 (62) to Agent 1, as it is their second-highest valued item.
7. **Agent 2**: We can allocate item 2 (46) to Agent 2, as they value it more than the remaining agent (Agent 3).

Let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and all 7 items are allocated.
