Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  84  55  47  68  25  43
1  21  93   1  22  93   8  95
2   2  21  96  81  20  23  44
3   8  76  93  53   7  21   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" process based on the agents' valuations. This process will help in minimizing envy and ensuring that each agent receives items that they value highly.

First, let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items in a way that seems fair based on each agent's preferences.

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the most (84).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the most (95).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the most (96).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the most (93), but since Agent 2 values it more, let's consider next highest, which is item 1 (76).

Proceeding with the allocation:

- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it highly (84). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 1 since it's their highest value (95).
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 2 since it's their highest value (96).
- **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 3. It's their next best choice after item 2.
- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 0, as it is their next best available choice.
- **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 1, since it's another high-value item for them.
- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 2, as it's their next best available item.

This allocation gives each agent items they value highly, while ensuring that each agent ends up with items that are best available to them in a fair manner.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items in a way that attempts to minimize envy.
