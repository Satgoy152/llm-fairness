Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  21  39   0  11  11  91
1  88  60  84  16  16  37  16
2  54  35  58  86  81  43  85
3  53  10  99  62  69  84  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuations and aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, we will try to allocate the items in a way that respects these preferences as much as possible. One approach is to use a maximum matching or a similar allocation strategy, but given the constraints, we will attempt to allocate items such that each agent gets a bundle they value highly, while minimizing envy.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 91. Giving them item 6 satisfies a significant portion of their preferences.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 88. Allocating item 0 to Agent 1 provides them with their most valued item.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 86. Assigning item 3 to Agent 2 addresses their top preference.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 99. Providing item 2 to Agent 3 fulfills their greatest valuation.

Now, with 3 items remaining (items 1, 4, 5), we aim to distribute these to balance the values:

5. **Agent 0**: To balance the allocation, we can give item 1 to Agent 0. This way, Agent 0 gets two items they value moderately (21 and 91).

6. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 to Agent 2, who values it at 43, which complements their already high-value item 3.

7. **Agent 3**: Lastly, give item 4 to Agent 3, who values it at 69. This provides a balance with the high-value item they already have.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with items they highly value and aims to minimize envy among the agents.
