Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  21  97  49  32  83  49
1  69  25  59  97  77  91  51
2  10  49  96  67  18  37   0
3  23  94  51  32  28   9  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, while ensuring all items are allocated. We'll attempt to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Let's proceed with the following steps:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Matches**: Initially, try to assign items to agents who value them the most.
2. **Ensure Fairness**: Adjust the allocations to avoid significant envy, ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy

- **Agent 0**: Values item 2 highly (97), so we will initially assign item 2 to them.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 3 highly (97), so we will initially assign item 3 to them.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 2 highly, but since it's already assigned, we look for the next best high-value item. Item 1 (49) is a good candidate.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 1 highly (94). Since item 1 is assigned, we look for item 6 (40) as a reasonable value.

### Adjustments

- To balance the allocations and ensure all items are distributed: 
  - Agent 0 can take items 0 and 5, as they also have reasonable valuations (39 and 83).
  - Agent 1 can take item 4, which is also valuable to them (77).
  - Agent 3 can take item 1, as it was not assigned and they value it highly (94).

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance out the items based on agents' preferences and ensures that every item is allocated while aiming to minimize envy among the agents.
