Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  30  84  37  34  88  38
1  51  63  89  41  52  89  78
2  95  82   6  57  17  71  73
3  56  44  53  82  91  82   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's the breakdown of the agents' preferences for the items:

- **Agent 0** values item 5 the most (88), followed by item 2 (84).
- **Agent 1** values both items 2 and 5 the most (89 each).
- **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (95).
- **Agent 3** values item 4 the most (91).

Given these preferences, we aim to allocate the items so that each agent receives a bundle of items they highly value while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. 

Let's consider an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 5 and item 2. We can assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 2 and 5. Since item 5 is already taken, assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 1, 3, and 6.

- Assign item 1 to **Agent 3**, as they have a relatively high valuation (44) compared to other unallocated items.
- Assign item 3 to **Agent 2**, as this provides a balance given their preference for item 0.
- Assign item 6 to **Agent 1**, as it complements their valuation after item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, and the distribution is balanced according to their preferences.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences and attempts to maintain a sense of fairness and envy-freeness.
