Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  33  94  49  81  40  54
1  71  77  77  51  66  68   2
2  22  91  69  88  49  40  41
3  18  83  54  67  46  28  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 77 77 51 66 68  2]
 [22 91 69 88 49 40 41]
 [18 83 54 67 46 28 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a set of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the matrix of valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items by considering each agent's preferences and trying to balance the allocations.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuation for item 2 (94).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2 (71, 77, 77).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuation for item 1 and 3 (91, 88).
4. **Agent 3** has high valuation for item 1 (83).

To distribute the items fairly, we will aim to give each agent items that they value highly and try to avoid envy:

- Give **Agent 0** item 2, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign **Agent 1** items 0 and 4, as item 0 is one of their highest valued items and item 4 is high relative to the remaining options.
- Assign **Agent 2** items 1 and 3, as these are their highest valued items.
- Assign **Agent 3** items 5 and 6, as these items are not particularly valued by others.

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and attempts to minimize envy. By ensuring each agent receives at least one item they value, we aim for a fair division.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item they value, minimizing potential envy and aiming for a fair division of goods.
