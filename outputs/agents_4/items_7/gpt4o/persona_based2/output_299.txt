Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  65  25  28  45  51   2
1  33  50  76  96  68  59  79
2  47   4  68  71  47  52  92
3  76  58  40  98  96  13  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the "round-robin" or "sequential" method, where each agent picks their most preferred item in turns until all items are allocated. We'll do this while keeping track of each agent's valuation to ensure fairness.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initialize**:
   - Each agent starts with an empty list of items.
   - Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   - Agents: 0, 1, 2, 3

2. **Round 1**:
   - Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 98)
   - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 76)
   - Agent 2 picks item 6 (value 92)
   - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 96)

3. **Round 2**:
   - Agent 3 picks item 4 (value 96)
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 59)
   - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 4)

Now, all items have been allocated. Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items: [0]
- Agent 1 has items: [2, 5]
- Agent 2 has items: [6, 1]
- Agent 3 has items: [3, 4]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
