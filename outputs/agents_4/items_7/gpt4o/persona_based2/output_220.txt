Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  80  31  58  22  26  64
1   9  26  75  10  32  19  99
2  35  56  46  88  91  43  57
3  85  97  48  67  90  60  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to consider allocations that minimize envy and maximize satisfaction based on the given valuations. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total utility for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. However, with discrete items and integer allocations, some degree of envy might be unavoidable. Let's perform an allocation with an eye towards fairness:

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: 64 + 80 + 31 + 58 + 22 + 26 + 64 = 345
- Agent 1: 9 + 26 + 75 + 10 + 32 + 19 + 99 = 270
- Agent 2: 35 + 56 + 46 + 88 + 91 + 43 + 57 = 416
- Agent 3: 85 + 97 + 48 + 67 + 90 + 60 + 48 = 495

Next, let's attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and minimizing envy:

1. **Agent 3** highly values items 1 (97) and 4 (90). Let's allocate these to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 2** highly values items 4 (91) and 3 (88), but item 4 is already allocated. So, allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 6 (99). Let's allocate this to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (80), but it's already taken. The next highest valuation is item 0 (64), so allocate this to Agent 0.

At this point, we have allocated 4 out of 7 items. Let's proceed with the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0** can be allocated item 5 (26) as it is the next highest available item for them.
6. **Agent 2** can be allocated item 2 (46), as it is the next highest available item.
7. **Agent 3** can take the remaining item 6 (60), which they value reasonably high.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and tries to distribute the items in a way that respects the individual valuations as much as possible.
