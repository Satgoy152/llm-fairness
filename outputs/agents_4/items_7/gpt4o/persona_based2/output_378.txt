Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  78  56  86  90  92  67
1   3  65  21   0   1  63  47
2  57  18   1  22   9  30  16
3  61  13   6   0  29  55  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to create an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, considering their valuations. Given the valuations, we can use a simple heuristic or algorithm to allocate the items. Here, I will use a method that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation for their allocated items while ensuring that no agent ends up with fewer items than necessary.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations on items 0, 3, 5.
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations on items 1, 5, 6.
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuations on items 0, 5, 3.
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuations on items 0, 6, 5.

The goal is to fairly allocate these items:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (98). Give to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (65). Give to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Allocate this item to Agent 0 since they have a higher valuation compared to others (56).
4. **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 2, even though Agent 0 has a high valuation, Agent 2 will benefit more from getting a share they value (22).
5. **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 0, who values it highly (90).
6. **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 3, who has a relatively high valuation (55) compared to others.
7. **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 3, who has the highest valuation for this item (83).

By following these steps, we can ensure an allocation that tries to maximize satisfaction for each agent.

Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are relatively more valuable to them given the constraints, while all items are allocated.
