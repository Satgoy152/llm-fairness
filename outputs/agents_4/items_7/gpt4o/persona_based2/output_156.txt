Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  45  43  10   0  35  27
1   1   8  34  50  66  55  29
2  23  74  18  42  18  89  82
3  86  64  50  87  11  82  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item and aim to balance their satisfaction. 

The valuations are as follows:

```
Agent 0: [95, 45, 43, 10, 0, 35, 27]
Agent 1: [1, 8, 34, 50, 66, 55, 29]
Agent 2: [23, 74, 18, 42, 18, 89, 82]
Agent 3: [86, 64, 50, 87, 11, 82, 23]
```

A common strategy is to allocate items such that the maximum envy among agents is minimized. Envy is defined by an agent valuing another agent's bundle more than their own. 

We will try to allocate items by considering each agent's highest-valued items that have not yet been allocated:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (95).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (66).
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most (89).
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the most (87).

We allocate these items first:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 5.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.

Next, we allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 6) considering the next highest valuations:

- **Agent 2** values item 6 second highest (82). Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 next (64). Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 0** values item 2 next (43). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: items [4]
- Agent 2: items [5, 6]
- Agent 3: items [3, 1]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```
