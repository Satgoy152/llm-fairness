Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48   2  31  42   6  78  21
1  76  64  29  20   8  90  27
2  41  49  21  85  75   9  86
3  44  34  38  15  35  94  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. Determine an initial allocation that assigns items to agents based on their highest valuations.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure that each agent receives a fair share, considering their preferences.

To achieve this, we will start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Then we will adjust as necessary to ensure a fair distribution:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 1 (value: 76)
- Item 1: Assign to Agent 1 (value: 64)
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 0 (value: 31)
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 2 (value: 85)
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 2 (value: 75)
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 1 (value: 90)
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 2 (value: 86)

Now, let's ensure each agent receives a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0: Currently has Item 2.
- Agent 1: Has Items 0, 1, and 5.
- Agent 2: Has Items 3, 4, and 6.
- Agent 3: Has no items.

To make the distribution more equitable and ensure Agent 3 receives items, we can make the following adjustments:

- Move Item 1 from Agent 1 to Agent 3 to give Agent 3 an item.
- Move Item 0 from Agent 1 to Agent 3 to further equalize.

Re-evaluate the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4, 6
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1

This allocation ensures that each agent has items and attempts to balance the distribution based on their preferences. The final allocation is presented below:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 4, 6],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
