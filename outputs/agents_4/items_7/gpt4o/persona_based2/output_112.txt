Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  85  51  57  73  40  51
1  10  30  91  33   6  21  14
2  47  67  72  59  86  32  95
3  35  67  41  47  59  15  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items amongst the agents, we need to consider their valuations of the items. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that every agent feels they have received a fair share given their own valuations. One approach is to attempt to minimize envy, where an agent prefers the bundle of another agent. However, with integer constraints and specific valuations, achieving complete envy-freeness might not always be possible. Nonetheless, we can aim for a fair division that balances the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a possible fair allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: Determine which items are most valued by each agent and try to allocate those if possible.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating items that are highly valued by a single agent or distinctly more valuable to one agent than others. This helps in reducing potential envy.

3. **Balancing**: Distribute remaining items to balance the total valuation each agent receives as closely as possible.

Given the valuations provided, here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items that are valued relatively high by Agent 0 compared to others are items 0, 1, and 4. Allocate these to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 the most. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has a moderate preference across items. Allocate items 3 and 5 to Agent 3, which are relatively better for them compared to other agents.

By following this allocation strategy, we aim to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items, and the total number of items allocated is 7, as required.
