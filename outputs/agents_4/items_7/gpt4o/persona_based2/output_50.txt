Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  13  11  66  37   7   8
1  52  36  65   7  13  74  11
2  65   5  76  94  76  38  78
3  35  74  63   6  17  83  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73 13 11 66 37  7  8]
 [52 36 65  7 13 74 11]
 [65  5 76 94 76 38 78]
 [35 74 63  6 17 83 83]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation, if possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own, based on their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items accordingly:

```
Valuations Table:
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0          73  13  11  66  37   7   8
1          52  36  65   7  13  74  11
2          65   5  76  94  76  38  78
3          35  74  63   6  17  83  83
```

**Step 1: Identify highest valuation per agent**

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 73.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 74.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 94.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 83, but since item 5 is already taken by Agent 1, their next highest valued items are 6 and 1, both at 83 and 74 respectively.

**Step 2: Initial Allocation**

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

**Step 3: Allocate remaining items**

Remaining items: 2, 4, 6.

- Agent 2 values item 2 highest among the remaining ones, so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 0 values item 4 next, assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highest among remaining items, assign item 6 to Agent 3.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [5]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 6]

This allocation is constructed to minimize envy, considering each agentâ€™s highest-valued items first, and then balancing according to remaining values.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
