Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  89  43  66  13  52  44
1  22  88  31  91  96  15  21
2  58   2  95  81  42  83  97
3  21  82  90  87  12  56  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [21 82 90 87 12 56 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that achieves envy-freeness as much as possible, meaning each agent should not prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations table, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that the allocation is as balanced as possible.

Here is the valuations table for clarity:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 3      | 89     | 43     | 66     | 13     | 52     | 44     |
| 1     | 22     | 88     | 31     | 91     | 96     | 15     | 21     |
| 2     | 58     | 2      | 95     | 81     | 42     | 83     | 97     |
| 3     | 21     | 82     | 90     | 87     | 12     | 56     | 66     |

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (89)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (96)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 6 (97)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (87)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate 3 more items. 

5. **Remaining Items: 0, 2, 5**
   - Agent 2 has high valuation for Item 2 (95), allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 has moderate valuation for Item 5 (52), allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has moderate valuation for Item 0 (22), allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations

The allocation ensures that each agent gets a share of the items based on their preferences, and we have distributed all 7 items. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints and the goal of minimizing envy.
