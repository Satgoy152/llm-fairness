Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  84   4  33  51  26  55
1  57  60  81  57  38  40   3
2  92  85   6  15  79  96  72
3  93  16   8  18  71  13  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should value their bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuation. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer constraints on the number of items each agent receives, we will strive for a solution that approximates this fairness criterion.

Let's first analyze the total valuation for each agent, which is the sum of valuations of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 23 + 84 + 4 + 33 + 51 + 26 + 55 = 276
- Agent 1: 57 + 60 + 81 + 57 + 38 + 40 + 3 = 336
- Agent 2: 92 + 85 + 6 + 15 + 79 + 96 + 72 = 445
- Agent 3: 93 + 16 + 8 + 18 + 71 + 13 + 19 = 238

Given these total valuations, we want to allocate items such that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged based on their own valuation scale.

Let's attempt to allocate the items through a series of steps:

1. Assign the item that each agent values the most if possible.
2. Continue assigning items based on decreasing value to each agent while considering the remaining items.

Following this approach:

- **Agent 0**: Most valued item is 1 (84). We assign item 1 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Most valued item is 2 (81). We assign item 2 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Most valued item is 5 (96). We assign item 5 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Most valued item is 0 (93). We assign item 0 to agent 3.

Next, we allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 3, 4, 6.
- **Agent 0**: Next highest value is item 4 (51). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Next highest value is item 3 (57). Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Next highest value is item 6 (72). Assign item 6 to agent 2.

This allocation attempts to balance the highest possible valuation for each agent given the constraints and the sequential allocation process.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0]
}
```
