Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  10  48  28  64  12   4
1  90  25  63  12  36  72   9
2  14  47   4  17  82  71  70
3  91   9  20  56  15  52  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 10 48 28 64 12  4]
 [90 25 63 12 36 72  9]
 [14 47  4 17 82 71 70]
 [91  9 20 56 15 52 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we will use principles from fair division. One common goal is to ensure that each agent feels they receive a fair share relative to their valuation of the items.

The problem can be approached using the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of the utilities each agent derives from their allocated items. This often leads to allocations that are envy-free or approximately envy-free, and Pareto efficient.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [94, 10, 48, 28, 64, 12, 4]
Agent 1: [90, 25, 63, 12, 36, 72, 9]
Agent 2: [14, 47, 4, 17, 82, 71, 70]
Agent 3: [91, 9, 20, 56, 15, 52, 93]
```

Our goal is to allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign item 0 to agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 94, which is the highest single valuation across all agents for this item.

2. **Assign item 1 to agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 at 47, which is the highest among the agents for this item.

3. **Assign item 2 to agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 at 63, which is the highest among the agents for this item.

4. **Assign item 3 to agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 at 56, which is the highest among the agents for this item.

5. **Assign item 4 to agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 at 82, which is the highest among the agents for this item.

6. **Assign item 5 to agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 at 72, which is the highest among the agents for this item.

7. **Assign item 6 to agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 6 at 93, which is the highest among the agents for this item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and is likely to be envy-free or approximately so.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize fairness based on the given valuations.
