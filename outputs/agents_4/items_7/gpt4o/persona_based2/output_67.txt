Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  90  44  88   6  83  65
1  88  46  31  14  38   4  65
2  57   2  48  48  37  92  69
3  97  28  58  13  31  69  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can employ a method that balances the valuations each agent has for the items allocated to them. The goal is to ensure that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible given their valuation preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3. Allocating these items to Agent 0 would maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 0, but since it has been allocated to Agent 0, we should look at their next highest values. Item 6 is a reasonable choice, as it is also valued highly by Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 5 the highest, so it should be allocated to them. Item 6 was also highly valued by them, but it has been allocated to Agent 1.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 0, but it is already allocated. The next highest value is for item 3, but since it is allocated to Agent 0, we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

By observing the above preferences and considering the constraint that each agent should get an integer number of items, a fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1: Gets item 6.
- Agent 2: Gets item 5 and 3.
- Agent 3: Gets item 2 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuations while attempting to minimize envy among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
