Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  14  94  66  79   5  64
1  91  67   1  79  50  86  11
2  60  74   6  64  59  92  26
3  86  76  58  60  72  21  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that either maximizes the total utility or achieves some form of fairness like envy-freeness or proportionality. Given the problem constraints, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.

One approach is to use the "maximum marginal utility" method, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most among the remaining unallocated items. We will iterate through the items and allocate each one to the agent who has the highest valuation for it, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item by the end of the allocation process.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 19
   - Agent 1 values it at 91 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 60
   - Agent 3 values it at 86
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 14
   - Agent 1 values it at 67
   - Agent 2 values it at 74 (highest)
   - Agent 3 values it at 76 (highest)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 94 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 1
   - Agent 2 values it at 6
   - Agent 3 values it at 58
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Agent 1 values it at 79 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 64
   - Agent 3 values it at 60
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 50
   - Agent 2 values it at 59
   - Agent 3 values it at 72
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5
   - Agent 1 values it at 86 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 92 (highest)
   - Agent 3 values it at 21
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 values it at 64
   - Agent 1 values it at 11
   - Agent 2 values it at 26
   - Agent 3 values it at 78 (highest)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, let's ensure each agent has received at least one item:

- Agent 0 has items [2, 4]
- Agent 1 has items [0, 3]
- Agent 2 has item [5]
- Agent 3 has items [1, 6]

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item. Now, let's present the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
