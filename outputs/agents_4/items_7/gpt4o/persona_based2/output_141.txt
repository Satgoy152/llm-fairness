Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  17  51  36  70  41  49
1  76  70  35   4  39  23  30
2   7  52  22  31  22  38  15
3  14  10  31   4   1  99  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items to the 4 agents in such a way that the allocation is as fair as possible, ideally minimizing envy among the agents. A common approach to achieve this is to try to maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that no agent feels significantly envious of another's allocation.

Let's consider different methods to allocate these items, focusing on maximizing each agent's satisfaction and minimizing envy:

1. **Initial Analysis**: 
   - Sum of valuations for each agent gives an idea of total perceived value:
     - Agent 0: 330
     - Agent 1: 277
     - Agent 2: 187
     - Agent 3: 225

2. **Fair Allocation Strategy**:
   - We will attempt to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as balanced as possible.

3. **Allocation Steps**:
   - **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest (70). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
   - **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (76). Assign item 0 to agent 1.
   - **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest (99). Assign item 5 to agent 3.
   - **Agent 3** also values item 6 highly (66). Assign item 6 to agent 3.
   - Remaining items are 1, 2, and 3.
     - **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest among the remaining (52). Assign item 1 to agent 2.
     - **Agent 0** values item 2 higher than agent 1 or 2 (51). Assign item 2 to agent 0.
     - Finally, item 3 can be assigned to **Agent 2** who values it higher than agent 0 or 1 (31).

4. **Resulting Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [4, 2]
   - Agent 1: Item [0]
   - Agent 2: Items [1, 3]
   - Agent 3: Items [5, 6]

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
