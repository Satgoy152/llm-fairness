Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  45  82   2  12  20  14
1  18  70  56  20  60  26   2
2  27  29  19  49   8  27  88
3  96  84  69  11  48  37  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This might not always be perfectly achievable, but we'll try to minimize envy as much as possible.

Hereâ€™s one possible approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify preferences:** Start by identifying which items each agent values most.

2. **Prioritize allocations:** Allocate the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the total allocation is fair.

3. **Iterate for balance:** Adjust allocations to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Let's break down the allocations step by step:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Highest valued item is item 2 (value 82).
- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valued item is item 1 (value 70).
- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest valued item is item 6 (value 88).
- **Agent 3:**
  - Highest valued item is item 0 (value 96).

Given the above, we initially allocate:
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.

Now, allocate the remaining items (3, 4, 5) to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and aim for minimal envy:

- **Remaining items (3, 4, 5) and their highest valuations:**
  - Item 3: valued most by Agent 2 (49).
  - Item 4: valued most by Agent 1 (60).
  - Item 5: valued most by Agent 3 (37).

Allocate:
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.

Finally, ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valued items.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent gets items they value highly while distributing the remaining items to minimize envy as much as possible.
