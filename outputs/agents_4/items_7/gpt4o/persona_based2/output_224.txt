Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  81  61   8  55  27  62
1  52  29  99  49  80  18  26
2  56  99  26  23  74  24  64
3  41  67  68  18  89  99  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have been treated fairly given their valuations of the items. We will use the Envy-Free method, trying to minimize envy among agents by considering their valuations.

Let’s consider each agent’s highest-valued items and allocate each item to the agent with the highest valuation for it, if possible. We’ll then adjust to ensure each agent gets a fair number of items and resolve any conflicts by considering the next highest valuations.

Here are the steps we'll follow:

1. **Initial Allocation based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it highest (92).
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it highest (99).
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest (99).
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it highest (49).
   - Item 4: Agent 3 values it highest (89).
   - Item 5: Agent 3 values it highest (99).
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it highest (64).

2. **Check Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: [0]
   - Agent 1: [2, 3]
   - Agent 2: [1, 6]
   - Agent 3: [4, 5]

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
   - Try to distribute items so that no agent feels extreme envy.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0] - This is Agent 0’s highest valued item, and they get one item.
   - Agent 1: [2, 3] - These are Agent 1’s highest valued items.
   - Agent 2: [1, 6] - These are also highly valued by Agent 2.
   - Agent 3: [4, 5] - These are Agent 3's highest valued items.

This allocation ensures that each agent has a reasonable share of their highly valued items, minimizing envy across the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
