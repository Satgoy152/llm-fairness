Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  15  92  54  71  50  55
1  89  10  95  65  34  93  87
2  16  87  53  99  58  38  64
3  32  99  95  90  11  64  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that considers the agents' valuations and attempts to minimize envy. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent, given their own valuations. However, for integer allocations without additional constraints or techniques, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible, but we can strive for a balanced approach.

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [47, 15, 92, 54, 71, 50, 55]
   - Highest valued item: 2 (value 92)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: [89, 10, 95, 65, 34, 93, 87]
   - Highest valued item: 2 (value 95)
   - Second highest valued item: 0 (value 89)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [16, 87, 53, 99, 58, 38, 64]
   - Highest valued item: 3 (value 99)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Valuations: [32, 99, 95, 90, 11, 64, 22]
   - Highest valued item: 1 (value 99)

Given these valuations, we should try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives items. A plausible allocation could be as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (highest value for agent 0 and also high value for agent 1, but agent 0 gets priority here).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 0 and 5. (These are the second and third highest valued items for agent 1 after item 2).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 3 and 6. (Item 3 is the highest valued item for agent 2, and item 6 is also relatively high in value for them).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 1 and 4. (Item 1 is the highest valued item for agent 3).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, respects their highest preferences as much as possible, and distributes the items fairly among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
