Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  37   0  36   8  70  12
1  59   8   3  66  81  52  15
2  60  41  80  88  34  28  22
3  72  72  53  77   7  17  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 41 80 88 34 28 22]
 [72 72 53 77  7 17 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, which means each agent should feel that they received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the valuations matrix, we will try to assign items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

Let's first summarize each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0: 5 + 37 + 0 + 36 + 8 + 70 + 12 = 168
- Agent 1: 59 + 8 + 3 + 66 + 81 + 52 + 15 = 284
- Agent 2: 60 + 41 + 80 + 88 + 34 + 28 + 22 = 353
- Agent 3: 72 + 72 + 53 + 77 + 7 + 17 + 39 = 337

Now, let's allocate items to agents while trying to maximize their individual satisfaction and achieve a fair division:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (81) and item 3 (66). Let's allocate these items to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (80) and item 3 (88), but since item 3 is already allocated, let's assign item 2 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 3** values items 0 (72) and 1 (72) highly. Let's allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** can be given item 5 (70) since it is their highest-valued remaining item.
5. **Agent 2** can also be allocated item 6 (22) since it is their second-highest remaining value item.

This leaves the allocation as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1

This allocation covers all items and attempts to respect the highest individual preferences for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
