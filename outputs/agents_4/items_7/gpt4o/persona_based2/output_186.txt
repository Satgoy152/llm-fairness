Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81   7  29  50  36  37   3
1  51  82  95  73  61  76  13
2  33  35  70  33  90  13  73
3  96  56  90   0  72  82  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. Though achieving perfect envy-freeness is challenging, we can use methods from fair division to approximate it. In this context, we can use a method like the "maximin" approach that tries to maximize the minimum value each agent gets, or the "greedy" method where each agent picks their most valued available item in a round-robin fashion.

Let's take a simple approach to allocate items greedily based on each agent's preferences, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and we avoid any direct envy if possible:

1. Agent 3 highly values item 0 (96), so we'll allocate item 0 to agent 3.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (95), so we'll allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 4 (90), so we'll allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 also values item 6 (95), so we'll allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. Agent 1 values item 5 (76), so we'll allocate item 5 to agent 1.
6. Agent 0 values item 3 (50), so we'll allocate item 3 to agent 0.
7. Agent 2 values item 1 (35), so we'll allocate item 1 to agent 2.

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that they value highly while ensuring each agent receives some items. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation is designed to ensure that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, considering the constraints.
