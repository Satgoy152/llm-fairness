Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  66  28  39  36  85  66
1  98  19  94  89  57  57  43
2  93  89  38  55   2  87  28
3  96  84  21  48  77  89  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the preferences of each agent and ensure that the allocation is as equitable as possible. One approach to achieve this is to use the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum value, which leads to a more balanced distribution.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify Agent Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest.
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest.

2. **Initial Assignment:**
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 because it's their highest value.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 because it's their highest value and they have the highest valuation for it compared to others.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 because it's the next highest value item for them, and Agent 1 already has their highest valued item.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 because it's a high value for them and other agents have already received their high-value items.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Items 2, 4, and 6 are left. We distribute them based on maximizing minimum envy-free allocations:
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest value after their top choice).
     - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (next highest value after their top choice).
     - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (next highest value).

4. **Review Allocation:**
   - Ensure each agent has at least one item and the total allocation is exactly 7 items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims for a fair distribution based on each agent's preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.
