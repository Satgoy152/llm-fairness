Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  93  81  88  96  28  78
1  69  97  35  68  10  71  40
2  56  49  55  84  71  47  82
3  28  58  71  92  49   4  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [69 97 35 68 10 71 40]
 [56 49 55 84 71 47 82]
 [28 58 71 92 49  4 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness and balance in terms of each agent's preferences. Given the valuations, we can use a simple greedy algorithm to assign the items to the agents in a way that maximizes their satisfaction.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (84). Assign item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (97). Assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (81). However, agent 0 already has item 0, so we consider balance.
   - Agent 3 has the next highest valuation for item 2 (71). Assign item 2 to agent 3.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 (92). Assign item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (96). However, agent 0 already has an item, so we consider balance.
   - Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 4 (71). Assign item 4 to agent 2.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5 (71). Assign item 5 to agent 1.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6 (82). Assign item 6 to agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is made considering the highest valuations while trying to maintain balance across agents.
