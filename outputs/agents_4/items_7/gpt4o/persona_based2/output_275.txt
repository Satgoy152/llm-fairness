Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  53  40  15  96  57  39
1   3  47  95  91  76  56  47
2  39  79  55  30  74  16  95
3  84  44  34  48  11  33  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free and efficient distribution. This means that each agent should be as satisfied as possible with their allocation, ideally without envying others.

To approach this, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility based on their valuation of the items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Start by identifying the highest valuations each agent has for any item.
2. **Prioritize Allocations:** Allocate items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets approximately one or two items, balancing their total value.
3. **Check for Envy-Freeness:** Reassess allocations to minimize envy, ensuring each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to their valuations.

Applying this strategy to the given data:

- **Agent 0** values item 4 the most (96), so we assign item 4 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (95), so we assign item 2 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 6 the most (95), so we assign item 6 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 0 the most (84), so we assign item 0 to agent 3.

Now, we have items 1, 3, and 5 left to allocate. We'll distribute these based on the remaining highest preferences:

- **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 3 (91), so we assign item 3 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 1 (79), so we assign item 1 to agent 2.
- **Agent 0** has a reasonable valuation for item 5 (57), so we assign item 5 to agent 0.

The allocations are balanced in terms of total value and ensure that no agent is left with significantly less value. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, aiming to minimize envy and maximize overall satisfaction.
