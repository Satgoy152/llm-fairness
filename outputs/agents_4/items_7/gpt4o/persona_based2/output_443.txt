Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  58  31  53  95  46  22
1  63   3  62  75  88  96  20
2  41  38  67  40  49  53  95
3  70  56  70  45   9  32  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 7 58 31 53 95 46 22]
 [63  3 62 75 88 96 20]
 [41 38 67 40 49 53 95]
 [70 56 70 45  9 32 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for the items, aiming for an envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible distribution. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Firstly, let's summarize the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [7, 58, 31, 53, 95, 46, 22]
- Agent 1: [63, 3, 62, 75, 88, 96, 20]
- Agent 2: [41, 38, 67, 40, 49, 53, 95]
- Agent 3: [70, 56, 70, 45, 9, 32, 44]

Now, we will attempt to allocate the items, ensuring that we allocate all 7 items and that each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (95). We allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (96). We allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 6 (95). We allocate item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (70) and item 2 (70). We allocate item 0 and item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Remaining Items:** We have items 1 and 3 left to allocate.

For the remaining items, we distribute them to minimize envy:

6. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values item 1 at 58, which is higher than any other agent's valuation for this item. We allocate item 1 to agent 0.
7. **Item 3:** Agent 1 values item 3 at 75, which is the highest among the agents. We allocate item 3 to agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

After this process, each item is allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation is designed to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent based on their highest valuations for the available items.
