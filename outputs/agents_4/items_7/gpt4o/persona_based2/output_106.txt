Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9   0  48   9   4   6  43
1  47  26   1   3  23  90  59
2  83  46  30  88  79  41   4
3  29  22  90  28  14  96  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 9  0 48  9  4  6 43]
 [47 26  1  3 23 90 59]
 [83 46 30 88 79 41  4]
 [29 22 90 28 14 96 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received at least as much value from their allocation as they perceive any other agent has received from their allocation. Given the valuations matrix, we will try to allocate items in a manner that minimizes potential envy.

The valuations are:

- Agent 0: [9, 0, 48, 9, 4, 6, 43]
- Agent 1: [47, 26, 1, 3, 23, 90, 59]
- Agent 2: [83, 46, 30, 88, 79, 41, 4]
- Agent 3: [29, 22, 90, 28, 14, 96, 63]

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest (88). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest (90). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 3** values item 2 the highest (90). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** values item 2 next highest (48) after item 6, which is valued higher by Agent 1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 2** values item 0 the next highest (83). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 1** values item 6 next highest (59) after item 5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 3** values item 5 next highest (96) after item 2. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

The allocation can be summarized as:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [5, 4]
- Agent 2: [3, 6]
- Agent 3: [2, 1]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```
