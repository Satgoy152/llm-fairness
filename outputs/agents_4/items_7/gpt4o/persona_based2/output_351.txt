Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  74   2  19  73  12  36
1  27  64  81  88  95  28  98
2  92  97  59  25  21  21  28
3  55  82  28  95  71   9  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a manner that is fair and attempts to minimize envy, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that the distribution is as equitable as possible. A common approach to achieve this is to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents or to find an allocation where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation to their own.

One possible method is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion, where an allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent. However, achieving a perfect envy-free allocation is not always possible, especially when dealing with indivisible goods like items in this case.

Let's proceed with a reasonable allocation strategy:

1. **Prioritize High-Valuation Allocations**: Assign items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring that each agent gets items that they value relatively highly.

2. **Balance the Number of Items**: Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, while distributing the total number of items (7) evenly.

3. **Minimize Envy**: Try to ensure that the value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given values:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (40), item 1 (74), and item 6 (36).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (88) and item 4 (95).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (59).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5 (9).

Let's allocate items accordingly:

- **Agent 0**: Given items 0 and 1.
- **Agent 1**: Given items 3 and 4.
- **Agent 2**: Given items 2 and 6.
- **Agent 3**: Given item 5.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they highly value and balances the distribution of total items. While it may not be perfectly envy-free, it is a reasonable allocation given the valuations.
