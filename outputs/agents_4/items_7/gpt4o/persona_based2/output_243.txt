Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  38  66  40  16  89  85
1  25  80  10  48   4  55  44
2  49  48  74  97   4  20  52
3  42  17  19  72  89  60  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One possible approach is to use a round-robin method or adjusted winner procedure, but given the discrete nature of items and valuations, a heuristic approach might also be suitable.

First, let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [29, 38, 66, 40, 16, 89, 85]
- Agent 1: [25, 80, 10, 48, 4, 55, 44]
- Agent 2: [49, 48, 74, 97, 4, 20, 52]
- Agent 3: [42, 17, 19, 72, 89, 60, 26]

We need to allocate 7 items, and each agent should receive an integer number of items.

Given these valuations, let's try to find an allocation that maximizes each agent's total value while striving to avoid envy.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Highest Valuation Assignment**: Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item.

2. **Balancing**: Adjust the assignment if necessary to balance the allocation.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**
- **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 2 (49)
- **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 1 (80)
- **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 2 (74)
- **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 2 (97)
- **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 3 (89)
- **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 0 (89)
- **Item 6**: Highest value by Agent 0 (85)

Adjust to balance:
- Agent 2 has been allocated 3 items (0, 2, 3), while Agent 1 has only 1 item. Let's adjust by swapping item 0 from Agent 2 to Agent 0, allowing Agent 1 to get a second item from either 5 or 6. 

**Final Allocation:**
- **Agent 0**: [0, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [1, 6]
- **Agent 2**: [2, 3]
- **Agent 3**: [4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and overall allocates all 7 items.

### JSON Format Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation is an attempt to maximize satisfaction based on given valuations, aiming to be as envy-free as feasible under the circumstances.
