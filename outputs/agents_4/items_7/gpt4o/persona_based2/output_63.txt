Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  21  85  22  41  86  91
1  14  84   5  22  90  18  68
2  62  22  55  94   4  34  66
3  11  35  66   7  66  25  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation considering envy-freeness, we must ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they prefer over any other agent's bundle, to the extent possible. Given the diverse valuations, it's important to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's consider various allocation strategies and try to find an allocation that seems fair to all agents.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 highly (91).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (90).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 highly (94).
   - Agent 3 values item 2 highly (66).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Value:**
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

3. **Remaining Items and Their Values:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 5.
   - Consider remaining items based on secondary high values and ensure no envy arises from the distribution.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0 could benefit from item 0 (73) as it has a high value for them.
   - Agent 1 could benefit from item 1 (84) as it has a high value for them.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (34) to somewhat balance the distribution, as it's less likely to cause envy.

5. **Check for Envy-Freeness:**
   - Ensure no agent prefers another agentâ€™s allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and provide each agent with items they value highly, ensuring that the distribution feels fair based on individual preferences.
