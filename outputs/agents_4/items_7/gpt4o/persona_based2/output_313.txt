Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  43  99  81   4  14  37
1  66  10  97  91  51  69  95
2  36  24  53  90  96  35  11
3  44  83  77  85  32  17  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to assign items in a way that minimizes envy. We'll start by assessing the highest value items for each agent and attempt a distribution that balances these valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (99)
   - Next highest valuation: Item 3 (81)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 6 (95)
   - Next highest valuation: Item 3 (91)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (96)
   - Next highest valuation: Item 3 (90)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (83)
   - Next highest valuation: Item 3 (85)

### Proposed Allocation:

Considering the valuations and aiming for a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (99) and item 0 (31) for a total valuation of 130.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6 (95) and item 5 (69) for a total valuation of 164.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4 (96) and item 3 (90) for a total valuation of 186.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1 (83) for a total valuation of 83.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their highest valued item(s) within the constraints and tries to balance the total valuations as best as possible given the discrete nature of items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the agents, attempting to balance the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.
