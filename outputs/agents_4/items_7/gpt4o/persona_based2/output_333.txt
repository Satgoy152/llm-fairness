Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  67  18  52  79   4  59
1  90  14  58  47   5  25  75
2  74  18  68  90  19  26  65
3  94  42  41  87  62  88  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their preferences, we can aim for a division that minimizes envy. While achieving complete envy-freeness might not be possible with integer allocations, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

Hereâ€™s one approach to distribute the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation of Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 60 + 67 + 18 + 52 + 79 + 4 + 59 = 339
   - Agent 1: 90 + 14 + 58 + 47 + 5 + 25 + 75 = 314
   - Agent 2: 74 + 18 + 68 + 90 + 19 + 26 + 65 = 360
   - Agent 3: 94 + 42 + 41 + 87 + 62 + 88 + 87 = 501

2. **Determine Fair Share:**
   Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, each agent should get approximately 1.75 items on average. However, since we can't divide items, we will aim for each agent to get either 1 or 2 items, while keeping envy as low as possible.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 (79) and item 1 (67) highly. Assign these to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 (90) the most. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 (90) the most. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 highly values item 5 (88) and item 6 (87). Assign these to Agent 3.
   - Remaining item 2 (valued 68 by Agent 2) can be assigned to Agent 2.

4. **Check Allocation:**
   - All items are allocated.
   - Each agent receives between 1 and 2 items.

5. **Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a set of items that maximize their valuations within the constraints, aiming to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives a reasonable portion based on their preferences.
