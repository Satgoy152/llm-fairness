Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  18  22  24  44   9  62
1  70  24  68  66   3  46  66
2  35  47  48  16  72  30  48
3  74   2  91  55  91  11  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 47 48 16 72 30 48]
 [74  2 91 55 91 11 37]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the 7 items among the 4 agents with respect to their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation from their own perspective.

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  18  22  24  44   9  62
1  70  24  68  66   3  46  66
2  35  47  48  16  72  30  48
3  74   2  91  55  91  11  37
```

We can approach this problem using a step-by-step method to ensure that each agent gets a share that they value highly. A common method for fair division is to use the "round-robin" allocation, where each agent takes turns picking their most preferred remaining item. In the absence of any specific procedure or requirement, we can proceed with this method while trying to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible.

1. **Agent 3** prefers item 2 (value 91). Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 3** also values item 4 highly (value 91). Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 0** prefers item 0 (value 71). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** prefers item 3 (value 66). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 1** also values item 6 highly (value 66). Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 2** prefers item 4 (value 72), but it's already taken. Their next best is item 1 (value 47). Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 0** is left with item 5 as their next best choice (value 9). Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 6.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a share they value relatively highly, and we maintain at least a degree of envy-freeness given the constraints. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
