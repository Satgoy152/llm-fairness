Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  26   8  20  61  78  36
1  26  24  42  31  72  59   4
2  86  40  29  96  69  96  38
3  28  13  15  42  60  41  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy among the agents. One method to achieve this is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, which allows each agent to feel that they have received a fair share unless they compare with another agent and remove one item from the other agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the given valuations and attempt to allocate the items according to this criterion, aiming for a balanced and fair distribution.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (96), so assigning item 3 to agent 2 is a strong choice.
   - Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 5 (78).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 4 (72).
   - Agent 3 values item 6 (71).

2. **Preliminary Assignments:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

3. **Remaining Items and Valuations:**
   - Remaining items are 0, 1, and 2.
   - Evaluate the best fit for these remaining items.

4. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0 and 5 (valuations: 37, 78).
   - Agent 1: Items 1 and 4 (valuations: 24, 72).
   - Agent 2: Items 2 and 3 (valuations: 29, 96).
   - Agent 3: Item 6 (valuation: 71).

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring no single agent receives a significantly higher value than others, thus minimizing envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint of assigning all items while aiming for fairness.
