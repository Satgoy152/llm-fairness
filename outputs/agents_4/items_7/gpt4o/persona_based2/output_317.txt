Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  10  47  82  24  91  52
1  13  78  56  84  17  68  38
2  17  68  15   5  58  22  31
3   4  97   2  93  20  17  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while attempting to maintain envy-freeness, we need to consider both the valuations of the agents and the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items. We'll attempt to balance the perceived value each agent gets from their allocations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. Assess each agent's valuation for each item.
2. Attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation from their bundle while ensuring that no agent envies another agent's bundle, if possible.
3. Keep in mind that each agent should receive an integer number of items.

Let's perform a simple allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 0 and item 5, so we start by giving them these items.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 3 and item 1, so we assign them these items.
- **Agent 2** has a relatively high valuation for item 4, so we assign them this item.
- **Agent 3** values item 6 and item 2, so we assign them these items.

This approach attempts to balance each agent's total valuation and respect individual preferences as much as possible.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a set of items based on their preferences in the table, attempting to maximize their total perceived value and ensuring that all items are allocated.
