Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  93  39  19  13  55  96
1  93  59  27  68  69  56  12
2  61  84  81  21   7   4  76
3  76  48  65  73  36  21  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 59 27 68 69 56 12]

 [76 48 65 73 36 21 28]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuation matrix, one approach is to use the adjusted winner procedure or similar fair division algorithms. However, since the problem involves discrete items and integer allocations, we'll attempt a simple heuristic approach to balance perceived fairness.

First, we determine each agent's highest value items to ensure they get some of their most valued items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 6 (value 96), then item 1 (value 93).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 0 (value 93), then item 4 (value 69).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 1 (value 84), then item 2 (value 81).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 3 (value 73), then item 0 (value 76).

After considering these preferences, we try to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, if possible. We need to ensure all 7 items are allocated.

Here's one potential allocation that aims to reduce envy:

- **Agent 0**: Items [6, 1]
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2]
- **Agent 3**: Items [3, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of their top choices and attempts to balance the remaining items to minimize envy.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items and aims to achieve a fair division according to the valuation preferences given.
