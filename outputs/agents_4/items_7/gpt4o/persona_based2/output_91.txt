Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2   9  21  34  65  42  79
1  60  28  93  68  60  32  40
2  43  62  25  45  84  79  10
3  97  64  17  34  58  51  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations. The goal is to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, as much as possible, given the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Identify Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.

   - Agent 0: 2 + 9 + 21 + 34 + 65 + 42 + 79 = 252
   - Agent 1: 60 + 28 + 93 + 68 + 60 + 32 + 40 = 381
   - Agent 2: 43 + 62 + 25 + 45 + 84 + 79 + 10 = 348
   - Agent 3: 97 + 64 + 17 + 34 + 58 + 51 + 16 = 337

2. **Calculate Fair Share for Each Agent:**
   Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, each agent should ideally have a fair share of approximately \( \frac{7}{4} \approx 1.75 \) items, but since we can't allocate fractional items, we need to ensure the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

3. **Allocate Items Based on Valuation:**
   Start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent to ensure they get items they value highly.

   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (79) 
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (93)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (79)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (97)

4. **Continue Allocation to Fulfill All Items:**
   Now allocate remaining items considering the next highest valuations and ensuring all items are allocated.

   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (84), as it has the highest value for Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (64), as it is the next highest value for Agent 3.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (68), as it is the next highest value for Agent 1.

5. **Finalize the Allocation:**
   Make sure each agent has an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated:

   - Agent 0: [6]
   - Agent 1: [2, 3]
   - Agent 2: [5, 4]
   - Agent 3: [0, 1]

The allocation achieves a fairly balanced distribution of high-valued items among the agents, respecting their individual valuations as much as possible. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
