Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  29  14  78  49  62  32
1  63  69  19  63  38  18  60
2  35  32  80  13  76  72  47
3  88  30  75  94  69  75   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuations. The concept of envy-freeness is key here, and while achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations can be challenging, we can aim for a distribution that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Given the valuations matrix, let's consider the following strategy:

1. **High Valuation Preference:** Start by allocating items to agents who value them the most. This approach seeks to increase total satisfaction by prioritizing high-value allocations.

2. **Balance in Allocation:** Ensure that each agent receives a near-equal number of items (since there are 7 items and 4 agents, the distribution will not be perfectly equal, but we aim for balance).

3. **Minimizing Envy:** Adjust allocations to minimize situations where one agent significantly envies another.

Let's proceed with a manual allocation based on the table:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 has a significant valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2 and also has a reasonable valuation for item 4.
- Agent 3 highly values items 3 and 5, but given the balanced need, we will need to allocate carefully.

Given these insights, a possible allocation is:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (valued highest by Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (valued highest by Agent 1).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (valued highest by Agent 2).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (valued highest by Agent 3).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation for Agent 2).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation for Agent 0).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation for Agent 1).

This allocation aims to spread the items in a way that respects high individual valuations. The distribution is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation gives two items each to Agents 0, 1, and 2, and one item to Agent 3, attempting to balance item numbers and respect high-value preferences.
