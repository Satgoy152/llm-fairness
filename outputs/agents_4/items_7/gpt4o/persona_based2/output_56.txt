Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  71  63  56  26  85  57
1  44  89  97  97   0  68  16
2  42  35  87  32  97   1  37
3  67  64  88  31  26  58  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their assigned bundle of items. This involves ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation given to any other agent. Since we have 4 agents and 7 items, it might be challenging to achieve perfect envy-freeness, but we can aim to minimize any potential envy by approximating an equitable distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 5, and moderate for 1, 2.
- Agent 1 highly values items 2, 3, 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 and moderately values item 2.
- Agent 3 values items 2 and 0 quite high.

A strategy that can help balance these allocations is to first allocate the highest-value items to the agents who value them the most, and then distribute the remaining items in a way that attempts to balance the total values across agents.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: 0, 5
   - Allocation: [0, 5]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: 2, 3, 1
   - Allocation: [2, 3]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: 4
   - Allocation: [4]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: 2, 0 (but these are allocated), next best is 1
   - Allocation: [1, 6]

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the preferences of each agent, giving priority to higher-valued items for each agent while ensuring each agent receives items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This way, each agent receives a bundle with items that they value relatively high, and the distribution is as fair as possible under the given constraints.
