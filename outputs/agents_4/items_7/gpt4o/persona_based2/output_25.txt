Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  55  18  21  44  99  77
1   6  79  65  66   7  94  84
2  70  86  59  60  82  39   9
3  91  71  46  83  69  35  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we should aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where each agent believes they have received the best bundle according to their valuations, or at least as good as any other agent's bundle.

We have 4 agents and 7 items, so it's not possible to give each agent an equal number of items. Therefore, we will have to balance the allocation such that the perceived value to each agent is as equitable as possible.

Let's start by examining the highest valuations for each agent and attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes the perceived fairness:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 5 (99) and 6 (77).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for item 5 (94).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1 (86) and 4 (82).
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0 (91) and 3 (83).

A potential allocation could be as follows:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is highly valued (94) and slightly less valued by Agent 0 (99), giving Agent 1 one of their highest preferences.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3, as it is the highest valued item for them (91).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it is the highest valued item for them (86).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it is another highly valued item for them (82).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it is the second-highest valued item for them (83).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it is the second-highest valued item for them (77).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, to ensure all items are allocated.

This allocation attempts to respect the highest valuations of each agent, distributing items in a way that can reduce envy.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This distribution aims to achieve a balance between each agent's preference, ensuring that each agent receives at least one highly valued item according to their individual preferences.
