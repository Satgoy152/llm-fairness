Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  52  61  33  18  28  54
1  61  28  40  94  48  20  41
2   6  54  81  66  95  41  97
3  50  12  69   0  41  58  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the matrix of valuations, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent with their respective allocations.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix for each agent:

- **Agent 0** values items as follows:  
  Item 0: 24, Item 1: 52, Item 2: 61, Item 3: 33, Item 4: 18, Item 5: 28, Item 6: 54.

- **Agent 1** values items as follows:  
  Item 0: 61, Item 1: 28, Item 2: 40, Item 3: 94, Item 4: 48, Item 5: 20, Item 6: 41.

- **Agent 2** values items as follows:  
  Item 0: 6, Item 1: 54, Item 2: 81, Item 3: 66, Item 4: 95, Item 5: 41, Item 6: 97.

- **Agent 3** values items as follows:  
  Item 0: 50, Item 1: 12, Item 2: 69, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 41, Item 5: 58, Item 6: 58.

Now, let's try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's valuations while considering envy-freeness:

1. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 3 at 94, which is the highest valuation for any item by any agent.

2. **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values Item 6 at 97, which is their highest valuation and no other agent values it higher.

3. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values Item 4 at 95, which is their next highest valuation and higher than other agents' valuations for this item.

4. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 2 at 61, which is higher than other agents' valuations for this item (except Agent 2, who has already received high-value items).

5. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3**: Agent 3 values Item 5 at 58, which matches what Agent 2 values but Agent 2 already has two high-value items.

6. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 0 at 61, which is the highest remaining valuation.

7. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 1 at 52, which is higher than other agents' valuations for this item.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's utility given their valuations and tries to maintain envy-freeness to the extent possible.
