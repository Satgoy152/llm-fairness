Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  20  33  27  28   3   8
1   4  40  73  31  34   1  27
2  22  17  17  15  42  70  90
3  95  57  78  25  61  52  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free division where each agent feels they have received the best possible allocation given their valuations. We will use a method that aims to minimize envy and maximize fairness.

Here are the agent valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [53, 20, 33, 27, 28, 3, 8]
- Agent 1: [4, 40, 73, 31, 34, 1, 27]
- Agent 2: [22, 17, 17, 15, 42, 70, 90]
- Agent 3: [95, 57, 78, 25, 61, 52, 85]

An approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations until all items are allocated. This can be done by iteratively assigning the item with the highest remaining value to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 3, as they value it the most at 95.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 3, as they value it the most after item 0 at 57.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they value it the most at 73.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as they value it the most after item 2 at 31.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3, as they value it the most after items 0 and 1 at 61.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as they value it the most at 70.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2, as they value it the most after item 5 at 90.

The resulting allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 5 and 6.
- Agent 3 receives items 0, 1, and 4.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, reducing potential envy and maximizing fairness given their preferences.
