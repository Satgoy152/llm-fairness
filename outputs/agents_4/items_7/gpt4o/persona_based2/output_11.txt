Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  25  23  64  60  43  20
1  40  46  32  23  49  26  95
2  91  17  85  43   2   9  78
3  60  28  49  12  57  46  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation that maximizes fairness, such as minimizing envy among agents or achieving approximate envy-freeness. Given that each agent must receive an integer number of items and each item can only be assigned to one agent, we will attempt to distribute the items based on their valuations to achieve an equitable distribution. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Valuations: [49, 25, 23, 64, 60, 43, 20]
2. **Agent 1:** Valuations: [40, 46, 32, 23, 49, 26, 95]
3. **Agent 2:** Valuations: [91, 17, 85, 43, 2, 9, 78]
4. **Agent 3:** Valuations: [60, 28, 49, 12, 57, 46, 92]

To start, let's assign items to agents based on their highest valuations and ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible. We'll also consider the overall distribution to maintain fairness:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (value 64).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 6 (value 95).
- **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (value 91).
- **Agent 3** highly values item 6, but since that's already given to Agent 1, let's assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 85).

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- **Item 5:** Assign to Agent 3 who values it at 46.
- **Item 4:** Assign to Agent 0 who values it at 60.
- **Item 1:** Assign to Agent 1 who values it at 46.

The allocation now is:

- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: [6, 1]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]
- Agent 3: [5]

This allocation tries to balance the values each agent receives while considering their preferences. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and attempts to balance their total perceived values, considering their individual valuations.
