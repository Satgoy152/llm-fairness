Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  71  18  18  29  70  47
1  48  97  97  74  78  89  87
2  49  15  31  18  74  68  18
3  35  58  14  32  96  57  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible items is often impossible, so we strive for a reasonable approximation or balance.

Here's a step-by-step approach to an envy-fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 64 + 71 + 18 + 18 + 29 + 70 + 47 = 317
   - Agent 1: 48 + 97 + 97 + 74 + 78 + 89 + 87 = 570
   - Agent 2: 49 + 15 + 31 + 18 + 74 + 68 + 18 = 273
   - Agent 3: 35 + 58 + 14 + 32 + 96 + 57 + 87 = 379

2. **Determine the Fair Share for Each Agent:**
   Given the total number of items is 7, each agent should ideally get a share proportional to the total value they perceive.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. If conflicts arise (multiple agents value an item equally), consider the overall balance across all items.

4. **Iteratively Adjust to Balance Allocations:**
   - Once initial allocations are made, adjust allocations to minimize envy and ensure no agent is left without items unless strictly necessary.

After analyzing the valuations and trying to balance the allocations:

- **Item Allocation Proposal:**
  - Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
  - Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 3]
  - Agent 2: Items [4]
  - Agent 3: Items [6]

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived values across agents while ensuring each agent receives items.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6]
}
```
