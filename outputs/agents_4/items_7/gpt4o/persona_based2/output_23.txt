Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33   8  95  70  67  22  14
1  20  23  68  83  27  52  87
2  70  47  38  65  49  46   1
3  22  50  23  94  55  27  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to satisfy the concept of envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness might be challenging, especially with discrete items, we'll strive for a balanced allocation.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Highest Valuation Method**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This method can help reduce envy by ensuring that each item goes to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 70.
- **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 50.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 95.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 94.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 67.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 52.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 87.

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, by revisiting some allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 4].
- Agent 1 gets items [5, 6].
- Agent 2 gets item [0].
- Agent 3 gets items [1, 3].

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated and no agent is left without items:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 2: Item [0]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 3]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and it reflects a fair distribution based on the highest valuation method.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
