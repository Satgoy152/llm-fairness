Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  97  43  40  93  91  19
1  65  88  52  29  41  77  81
2  68  18  28  51  74  71  74
3  35  26  95  49  52   8  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own given their valuations of the items. Since there are 4 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive one more item than the others.

Let's evaluate the valuations and seek an allocation that aims for balance and minimal envy:

### Step 1: Evaluate the total valuation of each agent.
- Agent 0: 25 + 97 + 43 + 40 + 93 + 91 + 19 = 408
- Agent 1: 65 + 88 + 52 + 29 + 41 + 77 + 81 = 433
- Agent 2: 68 + 18 + 28 + 51 + 74 + 71 + 74 = 384
- Agent 3: 35 + 26 + 95 + 49 + 52 + 8 + 64 = 329

### Step 2: Allocate items to minimize envy.
1. **Agent 1** has the highest total valuation. To ensure fair division, we start by giving them items where their valuations are relatively high.
   - Allocate item 0 (value 65) to agent 1.
   - Allocate item 6 (value 81) to agent 1.
   
2. **Agent 0** has the second-highest total valuation.
   - Allocate item 1 (value 97) to agent 0.
   - Allocate item 5 (value 91) to agent 0.
   
3. **Agent 2** has a moderate total valuation.
   - Allocate item 4 (value 74) to agent 2.
   - Allocate item 3 (value 51) to agent 2.
   
4. **Agent 3** has the lowest total valuation.
   - Allocate item 2 (value 95) to agent 3.

This allocation aims to distribute items such that each agent does not envy another's allocation, given their own valuations.

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with agent 1 receiving two items to balance their higher valuation, and maintains integer allocations for all items.
