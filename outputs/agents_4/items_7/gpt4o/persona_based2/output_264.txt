Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  59   0  95  22  61  75
1  24   3   5  84  79  86  12
2  15  72  66  54  98  22  70
3  48  45  28  43  14  84  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent's allocation is as envy-free as possible. This means we want to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuations and ensuring that no agent would prefer another agent's bundle of items over their own.

First, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 95, followed by item 0 at 82.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 86, followed by item 4 at 79.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 98, followed by item 1 at 72.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 84, followed by item 0 at 48.

Given the constraints and the valuations, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets the items they value the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (value 95) and item 0 (value 82) as they are the highest valued items for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (value 86) as it is the highest valued item for agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (value 98) as it is the highest valued item for agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 1 (value 72) and item 6 (value 70) as they are the highest remaining valued items for agent 3.
5. **Remaining Item**: Item 2 (value 0 for agent 0, 5 for agent 1, 66 for agent 2, 28 for agent 3) can be assigned to agent 2, as they value it the most after item 1.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on the highest preferences while ensuring all items are distributed among the agents.
