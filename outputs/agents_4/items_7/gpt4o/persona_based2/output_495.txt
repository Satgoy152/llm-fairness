Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  20  46  38  20  79  88
1  76  36  59  90  89  79   6
2  85  92  52  48  13  45  20
3  70  92  40  75  20  74   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. We aim to distribute the items in a way that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent should ideally receive approximately 7/4 = 1.75 items, so some agents will receive 1 item and others 2.
   - Since we have 4 agents and 7 items, we'll assign 3 agents 2 items each, and 1 agent just 1 item.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - We aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while keeping the distribution as envy-free as possible.
   - We'll try to consider the highest valued items for each agent and distribute accordingly.

3. **Allocations**:
   - Agent 0:
     - Highest values are for items 6 (88) and 5 (79).
     - Allocate items 6 and 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1:
     - Highest values are for items 3 (90) and 4 (89).
     - Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2:
     - Highest values are for items 1 (92) and 0 (85).
     - Allocate items 1 and 0 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3:
     - The remaining item is 2, with a value of 40 for Agent 3.
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

4. **Resulting Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: [5, 6]
   - Agent 1: [3, 4]
   - Agent 2: [0, 1]
   - Agent 3: [2]

Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent gets and aims to minimize potential envy by ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly.
