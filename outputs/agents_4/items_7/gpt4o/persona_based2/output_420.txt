Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  12   8  81  24  40  89
1  76  10  53  19  98  79  92
2  32  28  73  49  64  31  36
3   0  94  55  73  17  68  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [76 10 53 19 98 79 92]
 [32 28 73 49 64 31 36]
 [ 0 94 55 73 17 68 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent believes they have received the most valuable allocation from their perspective. Given the valuations matrix, we aim to assign items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Let's explore an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (value 81) and item 6 (value 89). Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (value 98). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (value 73). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 1 (value 94) and has a decent valuation for item 5 (value 68). Assign items 1 and 5 to Agent 3.
5. Finally, Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for item 0 (value 76), so assign item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives each agent items that they value highly, hopefully minimizing envy. Here is the proposed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the 4 agents while considering their individual valuations in an attempt to minimize envy.
