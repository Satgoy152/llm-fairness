Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  59  69  90  63  83  78
1  75  96  10  90  95   4   5
2  26  49  67  49  20  52  66
3  47   0  10  35  72  78  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while attempting to maintain envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations. We will use a strategy that aims for envy-freeness, though perfect envy-freeness can be difficult to achieve in practice with discrete items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign each agent the item they value the most**: This helps ensure that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, reducing potential envy.

2. **Allocate remaining items based on maximizing total individual satisfaction**: After each agent receives their highest valued item, the remaining items can be allocated such that the total of the valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's go through the allocation:

### Initial Highest Valuation Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (value = 90)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (value = 96)
- **Agent 2**: Item 6 (value = 66)
- **Agent 3**: Item 5 (value = 78)

### Remaining Items: 0, 2, 4
Now, let's allocate the remaining items by maximizing the total value each agent receives:

- **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 0 (value = 83).
- **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 0 (value = 69).
- **Item 4** has the highest value for Agent 1 (value = 95).

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 0, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 4
- **Agent 2**: Item 6
- **Agent 3**: Item 5

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent high-value items according to their preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
