Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  66  84  57  81  44  15
1  27  85   4  89  71  85  16
2  30  57  32  49  18  42  69
3  23  44  26  21   8  53  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to maintain proportionality. Given the diverse valuations, we'll consider several factors, such as each agent's highest valued items, to guide our initial allocation and then adjust to balance the distribution.

Let's begin by examining the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (84).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (85).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (69).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (53).

A logical starting point is to allocate these highest valued items to the corresponding agents:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Next, we'll distribute the remaining items (0, 3, 4) in a way that attempts to balance the overall valuation and reduce any potential envy:

- Agent 0 already has item 2, valued at 84, which is a substantial portion of the total value. To maintain balance, we'll give Agent 0 another low-valued item, item 0 (valued at 8).
- Agent 1, having item 1 (85), also receives a fair share. To balance his allocation, we'll consider giving him item 3 (valued at 89 by Agent 1). This will further boost his valuation.
- Agent 3, who values item 5 (53), can be allocated item 4 (valued at 8 by Agent 3) to increase his share while keeping the proportionality.

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and the distribution is relatively balanced across their valuations.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items while attempting to maintain fairness through the highest valued items and additional balancing considerations.
