Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3   1  35  50  46  29  78
1  75   2  46  18  74   2  26
2  32  24  19  13  99   6  96
3  13   3  69  87  13  48  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to distribute the items so that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3   1  35  50  46  29  78
1  75   2  46  18  74   2  26
2  32  24  19  13  99   6  96
3  13   3  69  87  13  48  70
```

We will attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. A possible approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent receives a fair share of high-value items.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 3 and 6.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 4 and 6.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 3 and 2.

Based on these considerations, the allocation might look as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items [3, 6].
- Agent 1 gets items [0].
- Agent 2 gets items [4].
- Agent 3 gets items [1, 2, 5].

This allocation tries to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Now, let's format the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items and respects the constraints provided.
