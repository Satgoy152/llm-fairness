Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  88   7  83  58  41  76
1  74  64   0  45  85  81  58
2  86  31   2  15  36  91  53
3  18  57  27  60  92  56  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close as possible to being envy-free. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
         0   1   2   3   4   5   6
    0  73  88   7  83  58  41  76
    1  74  64   0  45  85  81  58
    2  86  31   2  15  36  91  53
    3  18  57  27  60  92  56  51
```

To start, let's try to allocate items by considering the highest valuation for each item:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is 86 by agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is 88 by agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 7 by agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 83 by agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 92 by agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is 91 by agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is 76 by agent 0.

Let's assign these items based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3, 6
- Agent 1: No items with highest valuation
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: Item 4

Now let's verify the allocations:
- Agent 0: Valuations for items [1, 2, 3, 6] are [88, 7, 83, 76] = 254
- Agent 1: No items, valuation = 0
- Agent 2: Valuations for items [0, 5] are [86, 91] = 177
- Agent 3: Valuation for item [4] is [92] = 92

We need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item (except for agent 1, who can have none if it ensures other agents have equitable distributions). We will adjust allocations to attempt better fairness:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4

Recalculating valuations:
- Agent 0: Valuations [88, 76] = 164
- Agent 1: Valuation [45] = 45
- Agent 2: Valuations [86, 91] = 177
- Agent 3: Valuations [7, 92] = 99

This allocation is more balanced, considering the highest value distribution. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences while maintaining a fair distribution of total value.
