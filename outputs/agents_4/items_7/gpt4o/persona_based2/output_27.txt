Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  28  77  98  49  94  52
1  45  47  59  58  80  58  79
2  44  80   7  55  99   1  47
3  38  39  55  33  12  50  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation based on their valuations.

Here are the steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent**: Start by identifying the items that each agent values the most. This helps in ensuring that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, which is crucial for minimizing envy.

2. **Assign the highest-valued items**: Try to assign each agent their highest-valued item if possible without overlap. If multiple agents value the same item highly, prioritize based on overall valuation balance or attempt to compensate with other items.

3. **Balance allocations**: Once the highest value items are assigned, distribute the remaining items to balance the total value of items allocated to each agent. Aim for each agent to feel that they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

4. **Minimize envy**: Adjust allocations if any agent has a significant reason to envy another's allocation. This may involve swapping items between agents to improve the overall fairness of the distribution.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 3, and 5.
- **Agent 1** values item 4 the most.
- **Agent 2** values item 4, but Agent 1 values it more, so we consider other items for Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 6 the most.

Given these preferences, let's assign items to agents while considering their valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (as it's highly valued by Agent 1, and no other item is valued as much by Agent 1).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values item 1 second highest after item 4).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values item 5 minimally, but it balances the allocation).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (Agent 3 values item 6 the most).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value significantly, and the distribution is balanced across agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value of items for each agent, aiming to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints and valuations.
