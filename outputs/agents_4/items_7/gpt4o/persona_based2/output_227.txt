Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  99  29  97  12  66  56
1  81   4   1  66  54  71   0
2  98  83  47  37  36  26  88
3   3   9  44  40  95  91  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent feels they have received a fair portion of the items based on their valuations. Given the valuations, we'll try to distribute the items such that each agent receives the most valued items relative to the competition for those items.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 and item 3 very highly (99 and 97, respectively).
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest at 81.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest at 98 and item 6 the next at 88.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the highest at 95 and item 5 also high at 91.

We will proceed strategically, allocating the items to maximize each agent's perceived value, while ensuring fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Prefer items 1 and 3. We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Given Agent 0's preference for item 1, Agent 1 will get item 0.
- **Agent 2**: Strongly prefers items 0 and 6. With item 0 allocated to Agent 1, item 6 goes to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Prefers items 4 and 5. We'll allocate item 4 to Agent 3 due to its high valuation.

Now, we have allocated 4 items and have 3 left to allocate.

- **Agent 0**: Since item 1 is allocated to them, we can consider item 3, which Agent 0 also values highly. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 5 to Agent 3, as they value it highly after item 4.

Finally, for the remaining item (item 2), we consider the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Valuation of 29
- **Agent 1**: Valuation of 1
- **Agent 2**: Valuation of 47
- **Agent 3**: Valuation of 44

The highest remaining valuation is by Agent 2, so item 2 should be allocated to Agent 2.

Summarizing the allocations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 6, 2
- Agent 3: Items 4, 5

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the preferences and valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
