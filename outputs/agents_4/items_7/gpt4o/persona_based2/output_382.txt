Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  77  54  31  10  89  80
1  21  73  90  47  96  23  71
2  51  74  77  36  43  12  63
3  91  56  38  26  31  69  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 77 54 31 10 89 80]
 [21 73 90 47 96 23 71]
 [51 74 77 36 43 12 63]
 [91 56 38 26 31 69 11]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations provided, we need to ensure that each agent receives items such that they feel satisfied with their allocation compared to others.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [89, 77, 54, 31, 10, 89, 80]
- Agent 1: [21, 73, 90, 47, 96, 23, 71]
- Agent 2: [51, 74, 77, 36, 43, 12, 63]
- Agent 3: [91, 56, 38, 26, 31, 69, 11]

A possible fair allocation can be achieved by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the items and distributing them in such a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 5
   - Valuation: 89 (item 0) + 89 (item 5) = 178

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 2, 4
   - Valuation: 90 (item 2) + 96 (item 4) = 186

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 1, 6
   - Valuation: 74 (item 1) + 63 (item 6) = 137

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item: 3
   - Valuation: 26 (item 3)

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences, ensuring that each agent feels that their allocation is fair compared to others.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 4 agents, and each agent receives a bundle of items that is as satisfying as possible given their individual valuations.
