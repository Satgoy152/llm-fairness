Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  73  69  65   4  37  95
1  56  90  73  30  43  26  86
2   3  18  32  18  61   8   5
3  61  46  94  50  58  80  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering the goal of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own under their own valuation. This is a challenging problem, especially when the number of items is not divisible by the number of agents, as is the case here (7 items for 4 agents).

One heuristic approach to achieve a fair division is to use the "maximize minimum envy" strategy. However, given the complexity and the discrete nature of the problem, we can use a practical approach to approximate a fair allocation by considering both the total value perceived by each agent and an attempt to balance the number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [49, 73, 69, 65,  4, 37, 95]
Agent 1: [56, 90, 73, 30, 43, 26, 86]
Agent 2: [ 3, 18, 32, 18, 61,  8,  5]
Agent 3: [61, 46, 94, 50, 58, 80, 54]
```

The goal is to allocate all 7 items such that:

1. The total perceived value of items by each agent is reasonably balanced.
2. No agent is overly envious of another's allocation.

Let's examine a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 1 and 6.
3. **Agent 2** has a distinctly high valuation only for item 4.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 2 and 5.

Considering these preferences, a reasonable allocation might be:

- Assign **Agent 0** items [0, 6]: Total value = 49 + 95 = 144
- Assign **Agent 1** items [1]: Total value = 90
- Assign **Agent 2** items [4]: Total value = 61
- Assign **Agent 3** items [2, 3, 5]: Total value = 94 + 50 + 80 = 224

This allocation attempts to give each agent some of their highest-valued items while keeping relatively balanced perceived total values. Agent 3 receives more items due to the distribution of their valuations over multiple items.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a share of the items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.
