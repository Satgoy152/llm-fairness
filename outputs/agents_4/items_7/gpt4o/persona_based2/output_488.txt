Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  78  77  97  32  23  40
1  16   7   6  75  84  93  74
2  31  16  16   2  25   4   0
3  41  47   0  72  95  74  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation of items for each agent, aiming for an envy-free allocation if possible. However, since envy-freeness may not always be achievable with integer allocations, we will prioritize maximizing the sum of each agent's valuations for their allocated items.

Let's go through the valuations and attempt an allocation:

### Valuation Matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  78  77  97  32  23  40
1  16   7   6  75  84  93  74
2  31  16  16   2  25   4   0
3  41  47   0  72  95  74  58
```

### Strategy:
1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent.**
2. **Allocate these items to the agents while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent.**
3. **Try to balance the allocations so that no agent feels significantly less valued.**

### Allocation Process:
- **Agent 0:** Highest valued item is 3 (97). Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Highest valued item is 5 (93). Assign item 5 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Highest valued item is 0 (31). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Highest valued item is 4 (95). Assign item 4 to agent 3.

We have allocated 4 items so far: 0, 3, 4, and 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 2, and 6) while considering the remaining high valuations and balancing the allocation:

- **Item 1:** 
  - Highest valuation is by agent 0 (78), who only has item 3. Assign item 1 to agent 0.

- **Item 2:** 
  - Highest valuation is by agent 0 (77). However, agent 0 has already received 2 high-value items.
  - The next highest valuation is by agent 1 (6). Assign item 2 to agent 1.

- **Item 6:** 
  - Highest valuation is by agent 1 (74), who already has item 5. Assign item 6 to agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items [1, 3]
- **Agent 1:** Items [2, 5, 6]
- **Agent 2:** Item [0]
- **Agent 3:** Item [4]

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation given the constraint of an integer allocation.
