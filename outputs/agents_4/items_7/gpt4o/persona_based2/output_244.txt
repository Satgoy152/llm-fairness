Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  58  53  92  90   6  66
1  36  83  19  55  62  86  95
2  11  64  73  66  42  17  64
3  66   4  20  18   6  40  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they are getting a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's first calculate the sum of each agent's valuations for all items:

- Agent 0 total valuation: \(79 + 58 + 53 + 92 + 90 + 6 + 66 = 444\)
- Agent 1 total valuation: \(36 + 83 + 19 + 55 + 62 + 86 + 95 = 436\)
- Agent 2 total valuation: \(11 + 64 + 73 + 66 + 42 + 17 + 64 = 337\)
- Agent 3 total valuation: \(66 + 4 + 20 + 18 + 6 + 40 + 61 = 215\)

Given this information, we'll attempt an allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair portion of the total value available to them.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 4, we assign these items to them. These items have valuations of 92 and 90, respectively.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 6 the most. We assign item 6 to them. Additionally, they value item 5 highly, so we assign it to them as well.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the most. We assign item 2 to them. They also have a relatively high valuation for item 3, but since it is already assigned, we look at item 1, and assign it to them as well.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has a relatively even distribution of lower valuations, but they value item 0 the most. We assign item 0 to them.

Now we need to verify our allocation to ensure all items are assigned:

- Agent 0: items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: items [5, 6]
- Agent 2: items [2, 1]
- Agent 3: item [0]

This allocation uses all 7 items and assigns each agent at least one item based on their valuations.

Below is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [0]
}
```
