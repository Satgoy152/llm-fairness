Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  58  76  91  99  44  94
1  97  25  69  13  96  99   6
2  81  71   4  14  60  86  14
3  60  43  87  76  67   4  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 43 87 76 67  4 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where no agent feels envy towards another agent's allocation. This is a challenging task due to the varying valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to use a method like envy-freeness or maximizing Nash welfare, which attempts to balance the product of utilities among agents.

Let's analyze the given matrix of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  58  76  91  99  44  94
1  97  25  69  13  96  99   6
2  81  71   4  14  60  86  14
3  60  43  87  76  67   4  15
```

Our goal is to make use of these valuations to assign the items in such a way that we maintain a balance in perceived fair value.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 4 (99). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 0 (97). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 0 (81), but itâ€™s taken. Next highest is item 5 (86). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 2 (87). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

After assigning these based on the highest valuations, we now consider the remaining items (1, 3, 6).

5. **Agent 0**: Next highest valuation is item 6 (94). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 3**: The next highest valuation is item 3 (76). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
7. **Agent 2**: The next highest valuation is item 1 (71). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 6
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 5, 1
- Agent 3: Items 2, 3

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to align the items with the highest valuations for each agent while distributing the remaining items in a balanced manner.
