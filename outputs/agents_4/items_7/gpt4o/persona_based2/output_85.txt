Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  77  52  19  23  10  31
1  53  30  43  49  25  61  61
2  46  26  11  46  86  41   9
3  20   6  72  44  93  12  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 77 52 19 23 10 31]
 [53 30 43 49 25 61 61]
 [46 26 11 46 86 41  9]
 [20  6 72 44 93 12 43]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own based on their valuations.

First, let's examine the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  77  52  19  23  10  31
1  53  30  43  49  25  61  61
2  46  26  11  46  86  41   9
3  20   6  72  44  93  12  43
```

Next, we'll consider allocating items by ensuring that each agent's perceived value is balanced. We will try to make allocations such that no agent envies another's allocation.

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 and item 1. Let's allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 4. Allocate item 4 to agent 3.
3. **Agent 1** values items 5 and 6 equally, and these are the highest among the remaining items. Allocate item 5 to agent 1.
4. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation remaining for item 3. Allocate item 3 to agent 2.
5. Now we have items 1, 2, and 6 left. Let's further allocate them:
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 1 to balance their allocation.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0 to enhance their allocation.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 3 to improve their allocation.

Let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of allocated items is seven.

The final allocation is:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1]
- Agent 1 gets items [5, 6]
- Agent 2 gets item [3]
- Agent 3 gets items [4, 2]

This distribution attempts to balance the perceived value among agents, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```
