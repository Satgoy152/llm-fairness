Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  32  11   5  97  84  35
1  58  37  35  98  17  73  16
2  77  24  91  23  45  31  81
3  25  55  63  90  36  15   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given the nature of the problem and the constraints (integer number of items per agent and total of 7 items), we will use a strategic approach to distribute items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction while considering overall fairness.

### Approach:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Each agent should ideally receive approximately 7/4 = 1.75 items on average. This means some agents will get 1 item, and others will get 2 items.
   - We will allocate items by observing the highest value each agent places on individual items and attempting to satisfy the most critical preferences first.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Begin by assigning each agent their most valued item, ensuring no conflicts.
   - Resolve conflicts by comparing second-highest values and reallocating as necessary.
   - Ensure total allocation sums to 7 items.

### Allocation:

Let's follow the valuation matrix to decide on item allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 4 (97), followed by 5 (84).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 3 (98), followed by 0 (58).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 2 (91), followed by 0 (77).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 3 (90), followed by 2 (63).

#### Initial Allocation:

- **Item 4** goes to Agent 0.
- **Item 3** has a conflict between Agent 1 (98) and Agent 3 (90). We give it to Agent 1 due to higher valuation.
- **Item 2** goes to Agent 2.
- **Item 0** has a conflict between Agent 1 (58) and Agent 2 (77). We give it to Agent 2 due to higher valuation.

#### Remaining Items:

- After initial allocation, items 1, 5, and 6 are unassigned.
- **Item 5** goes to Agent 0 (second-highest value at 84).
- **Item 1** goes to Agent 3 (only remaining agent with items less than 2).
- **Item 6** goes to Agent 3 (ensures Agent 3 gets at least 2 items).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest preferences and ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. It also respects the requirement to allocate a total of precisely 7 items.
