Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  99  72  13  21   7  50
1  53  59  33  31  21  97  51
2  29   6  61  43  35   9  19
3  62  33  52  15   6  33  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" approach, where agents take turns picking the item they value the most from the remaining items. This approach might not guarantee complete envy-freeness but can help in achieving a fairly balanced distribution.

Below is a step-by-step allocation based on agents picking the item they value the most:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 1 (value 99).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 5 (value 97).
3. **Agent 3** picks item 6 (value 98).
4. **Agent 2** picks item 2 (value 61).
5. **Agent 0** picks item 0 (value 2).
6. **Agent 1** picks item 0 (already taken, next highest available is item 3, value 31).
7. **Agent 3** picks item 4 (value 6).

Now let's summarize the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 0
- **Agent 1**: Items 5, 3
- **Agent 2**: Item 2
- **Agent 3**: Items 6, 4

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 4]
}
```
