Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  40  66  99  10  93  29
1   0  16  30  30  58  51  27
2  25  63  78  72  72  36  58
3  23  16  62  50  13  79  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 16 62 50 13 79 29]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations. A common approach is to use the Envy-Free Criterion, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation to their own.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm like the round-robin method, where each agent picks their most preferred item in a sequential manner until all items are allocated. Given the agents' valuations, we'll proceed with this method:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [17, 40, 66, 99, 10, 93, 29]
   - Highest value: 99 (item 3)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [0, 16, 30, 30, 58, 51, 27]
   - Highest value: 58 (item 4)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [25, 63, 78, 72, 72, 36, 58]
   - Highest value: 78 (item 2)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [23, 16, 62, 50, 13, 79, 29]
   - Highest value: 79 (item 5)

After the first round, the allocations are:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [5]

Remaining items: 0, 1, 6

5. **Agent 0** (next highest value after item 3 is taken):
   - Next highest value: 93 (item 5 is already taken, so next is 66, item 2, which is also taken, then 40 for item 1)

6. **Agent 1** (next highest value after item 4 is taken):
   - Next highest value: 51 (item 5 is taken, so next is 30 for item 2 and item 3, both taken, then 27 for item 6)

7. **Agent 2** (next highest value after item 2 is taken):
   - Next highest value: 72 (item 3 is taken, item 4 is taken, so next is 63 for item 1, but item 1 is taken, then 58 for item 6)

8. **Agent 3** (next highest value after item 5 is taken):
   - Next highest value: 62 (item 2 is taken, then 50 for item 3 is taken, then 29 for item 6 is taken, then 23 for item 0)

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [3, 1]
- Agent 1: [4, 0]
- Agent 2: [2, 6]
- Agent 3: [5]

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
