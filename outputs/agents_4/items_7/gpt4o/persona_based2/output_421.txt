Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  72  82  15   1  68  55
1  92  49  96  45  41  55  52
2  61  77  66  25  26  11  78
3  16  71  80  11  27  90   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize fairness, such as the "envy-free" criterion. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the agents' valuations for the items, let's analyze the potential allocations:

### Valuations Table
```
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   49  72  82  15   1  68  55
1   92  49  96  45  41  55  52
2   61  77  66  25  26  11  78
3   16  71  80  11  27  90   6
```

### Allocation Strategy
To minimize envy and ensure each agent is satisfied as much as possible, we can use a round-robin method, where agents take turns picking the item they value most that is still available. This approach is simple and often used in practice to ensure fairness.

1. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (96).
2. **Agent 0** values item 2 second most, but item 1 is still available (72).
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the most (78).
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most (90).

Continuing this process while considering remaining items:

5. **Agent 1** selects item 0 (92).
6. **Agent 0** selects item 5 (68) since item 1 was taken.
7. **Agent 2** selects item 3 (25) as item 6 was chosen.
8. **Agent 3** selects item 4 (27) as item 5 was chosen.

Now we have an allocation that accounts for all items:

### Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation is designed to minimize envy while ensuring all items are allocated. Each agent receives items based on their highest valuations available during their turn.
