Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  45   9  60  27  43  82
1  23  94  73  51  71  25   9
2  51  17  61   0  56  50   7
3  45  32  19  99  65  21  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 32 19 99 65 21 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness and try to ensure each agent gets a fair share of the total value according to their valuations. Given the valuations matrix, we aim to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair portion of the items. 

Here's the valuation matrix for clarity:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **0**      | 9  | 45 | 9  | 60 | 27 | 43 | 82 |
| **1**      | 23 | 94 | 73 | 51 | 71 | 25 | 9  |
| **2**      | 51 | 17 | 61 | 0  | 56 | 50 | 7  |
| **3**      | 45 | 32 | 19 | 99 | 65 | 21 | 71 |

To achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 the most (82), followed by item 3 (60) and item 1 (45).
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (94), followed by item 2 (73) and item 4 (71).
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (51), followed by item 5 (50) and item 4 (56).
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the most (99), followed by item 6 (71) and item 4 (65).

To create an envy-free allocation, we can assign items focusing on each agent's highest-valued items while ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (one of the higher values for Agent 2).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the 4 agents while considering their preferences to achieve a fair division.
