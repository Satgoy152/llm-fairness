Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  88  42  59   7  47  35
1  15  65  18  73  23  84  76
2  21  33  97  26  48   3  53
3  22   5  54  32  78  43  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 88 42 59  7 47 35]
 [15 65 18 73 23 84 76]
 [21 33 97 26 48  3 53]
 [22  5 54 32 78 43 65]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We'll consider the agents' valuations to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation as much as possible.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
          Items
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6
-------------------------------
0 |  98  88  42  59   7  47  35
1 |  15  65  18  73  23  84  76
2 |  21  33  97  26  48   3  53
3 |  22   5  54  32  78  43  65
```

To allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Highly values item 0 (98) and item 1 (88). Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1:** Values item 5 (84) and item 6 (76) highly. Allocating these items to Agent 1 is beneficial.

3. **Agent 2:** Values item 2 (97) the most. Allocating item 2 to Agent 2 will maximize their happiness.

4. **Agent 3:** Values item 4 (78) and item 6 (65). Since item 6 is already allocated to Agent 1, we allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Item 3:** This item hasn't been allocated yet. Agent 1 values item 3 (73) the most compared to others. Since they have received fewer items than others, giving item 3 to Agent 1 ensures a more balanced allocation.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, which are the most valuable to them.
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 5, and 6, which have high value for them.
- Agent 2 receives item 2, which is their most valuable item.
- Agent 3 receives item 4, which has the highest value among the remaining items for them.

This allocation aims to maximize individual satisfaction based on the given valuations.
