Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  88  66  14  64  58  36
1  85  79  33  41  18  59  68
2  18  84  50  26   4  91  62
3  54  58  97  97   5  21  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over the allocation given to any other agent. We will try to balance the allocations based on the agents' valuations of the items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 3 values items 2 and 3 highly.

We aim for a balanced allocation such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair given their preferences.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Agent 0:** Focus on items with high relative value.
2. **Agent 1:** Allocate the item with the highest value.
3. **Agent 2:** Assign the highest valued item.
4. **Agent 3:** Allocate items with the highest preference.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Items 1 and 4 (Values: 88, 64)
- **Agent 1:** Items 0 and 6 (Values: 85, 68)
- **Agent 2:** Item 5 (Value: 91)
- **Agent 3:** Items 2 and 3 (Values: 97, 97)

**Assessment:**

- Each agent receives items they value highly.
- Total items allocated: 7 (ensured by distribution).
- Fairness: Each agent receives items with high valuations relative to their preferences.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This distribution aims to maximize the perceived fairness from each agent's perspective, given the constraints of envy-freeness and integer allocation.
