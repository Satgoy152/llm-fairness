Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  32  41  87  81   4  95
1  79   1  80  26  26  30  80
2  45   2  20   7  20  23  83
3  98  66  13  61  23  58   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 32 41 87 81  4 95]
 [79  1 80 26 26 30 80]
 [45  2 20  7 20 23 83]
 [98 66 13 61 23 58  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate these items among the agents, we'll aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their valuations.

To approach this problem, we'll first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then attempt to allocate items so that each agent's share is maximized according to their own valuations.

The valuations matrix is:

```
Agent 0: [63, 32, 41, 87, 81, 4, 95]
Agent 1: [79, 1, 80, 26, 26, 30, 80]
Agent 2: [45, 2, 20, 7, 20, 23, 83]
Agent 3: [98, 66, 13, 61, 23, 58, 3]
```

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 total value: 63 + 32 + 41 + 87 + 81 + 4 + 95 = 403
- Agent 1 total value: 79 + 1 + 80 + 26 + 26 + 30 + 80 = 322
- Agent 2 total value: 45 + 2 + 20 + 7 + 20 + 23 + 83 = 200
- Agent 3 total value: 98 + 66 + 13 + 61 + 23 + 58 + 3 = 322

Next, let's aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value and reduces envy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 6 the most (95), followed by item 3 (87). We'll allocate these two items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 the most (79), followed by items 2 and 6 (both 80). Since item 6 is already allocated, we allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 the most (83), but since it's already allocated, we allocate the next highest available item, item 5 (23), to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 the most (98), but since it's already allocated, we allocate the next highest available items, items 1 (66) and 4 (23), to Agent 3.

After following this allocation strategy, we end up with the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their own perceived value, contributing to an envy-free division as much as possible given the constraints of integer allocation.
