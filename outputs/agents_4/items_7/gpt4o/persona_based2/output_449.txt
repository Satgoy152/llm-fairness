Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  10  50  34  14  96  20
1  86  94  66  78  23  87  53
2  79  96  76  78  97   1  31
3  17   2  57  16  23  69  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 94 66 78 23 87 53]
 [79 96 76 78 97  1 31]
 [17  2 57 16 23 69 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. In an envy-free allocation, each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation according to their valuations.

Here's the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: 0 (98)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: 1 (94)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: 4 (97)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item: 6 (97)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, we have assigned 4 items and have 3 remaining items: 2, 3, and 5.

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - For item 2:
     - Agent 2 values it highest (76), assign item 2 to Agent 2.
   - For item 3:
     - Agent 1 values it highest (78), assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - For item 5:
     - Agent 0 values it highest (96), assign item 5 to Agent 0.

This allocation is designed to respect the highest possible valuations of each agent for the remaining items, thereby minimizing envy.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations while attempting to minimize envy.
