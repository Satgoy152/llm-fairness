Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  70   6  65  40  68  77
1  52  12  40   6  95  90  57
2  15  67  71  23  61  96  95
3  61  42  77   1  75  96  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations. One common approach is to use the "envy-free" concept, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness is challenging, especially with integer allocations, we can attempt to minimize envy by considering relative valuations.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Prefers items with high valuations like 6 (77) and 1 (70).
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 4 (95) and item 5 (90) highly.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 5 (96) and item 6 (95) highly.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 5 (96) and item 2 (77) highly.

Considering these preferences, we can try the following allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Gets item 6 (77), item 1 (70)
- **Agent 1:** Gets item 4 (95), item 0 (52)
- **Agent 2:** Gets item 5 (96)
- **Agent 3:** Gets item 2 (77), item 3 (1)

This allocation considers high-valued items for each agent while distributing items so that no agent is left completely envious given the integer constraint.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed, and each agent receives items that are valuable to them based on their valuations.
