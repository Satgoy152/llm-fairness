Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  80  23  66  25  46  77
1  87  46  63   5   2  88  88
2  62  57   4  56  43  53  34
3  84  16  55   1  32  37  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair and envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to allocate items such that no agent feels another agent has received a more valuable allocation based on their own valuations. One method to achieve a fair division is the "round-robin" method, which allows each agent to take turns picking their most valued remaining item until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed step-by-step with this method:

1. Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 92).
2. Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 88).
3. Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 62), but it's already taken, so picks item 1 (value 57).
4. Agent 3 picks item 0 (value 84), but it's already taken, so picks item 6 (value 63).

5. Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 77), but it's already taken, so picks item 1 (value 80).
6. Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 88), but it's already taken, so picks item 0 (value 87), but it's already taken, so picks item 2 (value 63).
7. Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 57), but it's already taken, so picks item 3 (value 56).
8. Agent 3 picks item 6 (value 63), but it's already taken, so picks item 2 (value 55), but it's already taken, so picks item 0 (value 84), but it's already taken, so picks item 5 (value 37), but it's already taken, so picks item 4 (value 32).

9. Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 23), but it's already taken, so picks item 0 (value 92), but it's already taken, so picks item 3 (value 66).
10. Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 2).
11. Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 53), but it's already taken, so picks item 2 (value 4), but it's already taken, so picks item 0 (value 62), but it's already taken, so picks item 4 (value 43).
12. Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 1), but it's already taken, so picks item 0 (value 84), but it's already taken, so picks item 5 (value 37), but it's already taken, so picks item 3 (value 1), but it's already taken, so picks item 2 (value 55), but it's already taken, so picks item 1 (value 16), but it's already taken, so picks item 4 (value 32).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations given the constraints of the previous picks. After iterating through the agents multiple times, each item is allocated.

Let's summarize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences, minimizing envy among the agents by maximizing their individual item valuations.
