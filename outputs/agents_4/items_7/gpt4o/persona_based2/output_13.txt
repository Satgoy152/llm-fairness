Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  25  14  90  86  49  67
1   2  92  45  91  18  83  68
2  20   2  41  15  42  29  20
3  97   6  76  46  37  63  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent is satisfied with their portion and doesn't prefer another agent's allocation over their own. One common method used is the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar heuristic methods, but given the integer constraint and the need for computational feasibility, let's use a simpler heuristic based on maximizing utility for each agent while trying to balance total values.

Here's a step-by-step allocation procedure:

1. **Initial Allocation by Highest Value:**
   - Assign items to the agent who values them the most. 
   - This approach doesn't guarantee envy-freeness but is a good starting point.

2. **Adjust for Balance:**
   - Check if any agent has significantly fewer items than others.
   - Re-assign items to balance the number of items if necessary, while trying to minimize the reduction in total value for any agent.

3. **Final Adjustments:**
   - Ensure no agent would prefer another's allocation over their own, if possible.

Let's apply this method to the table:

### Initial Allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it at 97 (highest).
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 92 (highest).
- **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it at 76 (highest).
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 91 (highest).
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 86 (highest).
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 83 (highest).
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it at 92 (highest).

### Initial Results:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 5]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0, 2, 6]

### Adjust for Balance:
Agent 2 currently has no items. We can redistribute one item from agents with more items to Agent 2.

- Reallocate Item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 2 (Agent 1 has multiple high-value items).

### Final Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: [4]
- **Agent 1**: [1, 3]
- **Agent 2**: [5]
- **Agent 3**: [0, 2, 6]

This allocation keeps the highest sum of values with a relatively balanced distribution. There may still be some envy, but it's minimized given the constraints.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
