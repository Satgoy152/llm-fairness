Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  13  62  65  93  70  22
1   8  18  27  60  66  42  42
2   0  59  52  66  54  19  16
3  47   8  90   0  84  45   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use the concept of "envy-freeness". One approach is to try and ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the valuations, we can use a heuristic approach to allocate items fairly.

Let's go through the steps to find a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - There are 4 agents and 7 items, so not every agent will get the same number of items.
   - We aim to minimize envy by considering the highest value each agent places on the items and attempting to satisfy each agent's preferences as much as possible.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by allocating items that are most highly valued by each agent and attempt to give each agent at least one of their top-valued items.

3. **Assign Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 93, so allocate item 4 to them.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 66 the most, but since it's already allocated, allocate their next highest valued item, item 3, valued at 60.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 66, but it's taken, so allocate item 1, valued at 59.
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 90, so allocate item 2 to them.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 0, 5, and 6. Distribute these to balance the number of items:
     - Agent 0 can take item 5 (value 70).
     - Agent 1 can take item 6 (value 42).
     - Agent 2 can take item 0 (value 0), as it minimally impacts other allocations.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 4, 5
   - Agent 1: Items 3, 6
   - Agent 2: Items 1, 0
   - Agent 3: Item 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items in a way that tries to minimize envy based on their valuations.
