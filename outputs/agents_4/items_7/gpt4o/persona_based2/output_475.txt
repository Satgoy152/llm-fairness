Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  80  14  96  35  98  58
1  71  86  50  69  10  91  96
2  96  13  82  67  70  55  88
3  31  65  80  89  46  54  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims to minimize envy among agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the Nash social welfare or minimizing the maximum envy. Given that each agent should get an integer number of items, and there are 7 items to allocate among 4 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one item each.

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value. The following steps outline the approach to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Values**: Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Allocate the items iteratively by selecting the item that gives the highest marginal increase in value to the agent who values it most, considering what they have already received.

3. **Adjustment for Fairness**: After initial allocations, check for envy and adjust allocations if possible to reduce it.

Let's proceed with these steps:

1. **Total Values**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns:
   - Agent 0: 386
   - Agent 1: 473
   - Agent 2: 471
   - Agent 3: 449

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Start by giving each agent one item based on their highest preference that hasn't been allocated yet.

3. **Allocation**:
   - Assign items to agents based on their highest preference, iterating through agents in a round-robin fashion if needed.

Using this approach:

- Agent 0 strongly prefers item 5 (value 98).
- Agent 1 strongly prefers item 6 (value 96).
- Agent 2 strongly prefers item 0 (value 96).
- Agent 3 strongly prefers item 3 (value 89).

After allocating these high-value items, the remaining items are 1, 2, and 4. We now allocate these to minimize envy:

- Assign the next highest preference for unallocated items:
  - Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 86).
  - Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 82).
  - Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 35) to balance the allocation with one more item.

The allocations now appear as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items is 7.
