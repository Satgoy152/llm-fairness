Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  19  31  61   8  51  11
1  23  68  56  67  28  53  44
2   6  45  35  97  61  22  71
3  74  64  81  35  62  91  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a fair manner while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an approach that tries to balance the perceived value each agent receives. One standard method for fair division is the "Greedy Round Robin" approach, where agents take turns picking their most valued items until all items are allocated. Given that we have 7 items and 4 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, with some agents receiving two items, given that there are more items than agents.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 3**: Prioritizes item 5 (value 91), then item 2 (value 81).
2. **Agent 2**: Prioritizes item 3 (value 97), then item 6 (value 71).
3. **Agent 1**: Prioritizes item 1 (value 68), then item 4 (value 28).
4. **Agent 0**: Receives the remaining item, item 0 (value 51).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, and the distribution tries to maintain a balance in perceived value, reducing potential envy among agents.

The final allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation strategy attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuation, while ensuring all items are allocated.
