Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  87  94  99  34  77  25
1  62  19  91  61  61  75  67
2  94  22  69  10  71   0  93
3  44  15  24  67  91  98  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution where each agent feels that their share is as valuable as possible, ideally achieving envy-freeness. Given the table of valuations, we need to consider both the value each agent places on the items and the requirement that each agent gets an integer number of items.

A common approach is to use a method like the "maximum weighted matching" or "round-robin" allocation to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. However, since we have 7 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive 2 items while others will receive only 1.

Let's approach this allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 2 (94), Item 0 (90). 

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (91), Item 5 (75), Item 0 (62).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (94), Item 6 (93), Item 4 (71).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (98), Item 4 (91), Item 3 (67).

### Allocation Strategy:

- Start by assigning the highest value items to the agents who value them the most and work our way down, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

1. **Assign Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most (99), assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Assign Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most (94), assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

3. **Assign Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most (91), assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Assign Item 5**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most (98), assign Item 5 to Agent 3.

Now each agent has 1 item, and there are 3 items left (1, 4, 6).

5. **Assign Item 6**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most (93), assign Item 6 to Agent 2. (Now Agent 2 has 2 items)

6. **Assign Item 4**:
   - Agent 3 values it the most (91), assign Item 4 to Agent 3. (Now Agent 3 has 2 items)

7. **Assign Item 1**: 
   - The remaining item is 1. Agent 0 has the highest remaining value for it (87), assign Item 1 to Agent 0. (Now Agent 0 has 2 items)

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items in a way where each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with some agents receiving 2 items, and ensures that all 7 items are allocated.
