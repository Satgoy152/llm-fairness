Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97   7  36  88  77  62  82
1  36  81  91  82  20  35  68
2  30  39  62  63  68  80   5
3  11   5  96  18  70  84   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness. One common method is the Envy-Free Allocation, which tries to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations table, we'll attempt to allocate the items to achieve this goal.

First, let's look at the valuation matrix:

```
Agent/Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
-----------|---------------------------
    0      |  97   7  36  88  77  62  82
    1      |  36  81  91  82  20  35  68
    2      |  30  39  62  63  68  80   5
    3      |  11   5  96  18  70  84   2
```

A strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, provided it doesn't create an imbalance in allocation count. However, this method is not always envy-free but can be a good starting point.

Let's allocate based on maximizing valuations:

1. Item 0 is valued most by Agent 0 (97).
2. Item 1 is valued most by Agent 1 (81).
3. Item 2 is valued most by Agent 3 (96).
4. Item 3 is valued most by Agent 0 (88).
5. Item 4 is valued most by Agent 0 (77).
6. Item 5 is valued most by Agent 3 (84).
7. Item 6 is valued most by Agent 0 (82).

However, this allocation is heavily skewed towards Agent 0. We need to balance the allocations to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items while being as fair as possible.

To ensure all agents receive items, we can adjust as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3 (total value: 97 + 88 = 185)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4 (total value: 81 + 20 = 101)
- Agent 2: Items 5 (total value: 80)
- Agent 3: Items 2, 6 (total value: 96 + 2 = 98)

Now, each agent has received at least one item, and we have distributed all 7 items.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of items according to their valuations and ensures all items are distributed.
