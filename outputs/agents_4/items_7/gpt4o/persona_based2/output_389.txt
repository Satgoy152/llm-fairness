Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  96  92  91  47  99  35
1  28  57  76  86  16  12  56
2  15  97  76  56  45  91  36
3  21  67  22   4  41  71  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem of fairly allocating items among agents, we can use a method like the "Envy-Free" allocation or a similar fair division approach. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation, to the extent possible given the constraints.

Given the valuations for each agent on each item, we can attempt a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and their average value per item.
2. Attempt to allocate items such that the sum of the valuations for each agent is balanced and close to fair.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Step 1:** Calculate the total valuations for each agent.
- **Step 2:** Allocate items to maximize fairness.

**Agent Valuations:**

- Agent 0: 61, 96, 92, 91, 47, 99, 35 (Total: 521)
- Agent 1: 28, 57, 76, 86, 16, 12, 56 (Total: 331)
- Agent 2: 15, 97, 76, 56, 45, 91, 36 (Total: 416)
- Agent 3: 21, 67, 22, 4, 41, 71, 65 (Total: 291)

**Step 3:** Allocation

After analyzing the valuations, we will allocate items to balance the total valuations as much as possible:

- Assign item 1 (high value for Agent 0 and Agent 2) to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 and item 2 (high value for Agent 0) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 (high value for Agent 1) to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 (high value for Agent 0) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 (moderate value for Agent 3) to Agent 3.
- Assign item 6 (moderate value for Agent 3) to Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives from their allocated items.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.
