Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  26  57   1  36  55  13
1  22  44  59  73  61  71  78
2  77  71  89  91  42  88  64
3  35  77  15  10  15  79  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible according to their valuations.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations matrix:

- **Agent 0**: Values items notably high at positions [0, 2, 5].
- **Agent 1**: Has relatively high valuations for items [3, 6].
- **Agent 2**: Values items very high at almost all positions, particularly [2, 3, 5].
- **Agent 3**: Has highest valuations for items [1, 5, 6].

Considering these valuations, an approach to minimize envy and provide each agent with at least one item is:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items [0, 2] - These are among the items with the highest valuations for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items [3, 6] - These items have high value for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items [5] - Even though Agent 2 values many items highly, item 5 is a good allocation due to its high valuation.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items [1, 4] - These items are relatively high in value for Agent 3.

This allocation aims to ensure that no agent strongly envies another agent's allocation, given the constraints of integer allocations and the need to allocate all 7 items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation respects the condition that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
