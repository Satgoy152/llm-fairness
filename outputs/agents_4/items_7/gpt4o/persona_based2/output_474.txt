Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  67  47  63  86  86  80
1   0  10  25  54  19  99  21
2  56  20  60  88  10  71  88
3  99  77  61  34   5  45  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free or equitable distribution, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. A common approach to achieve this is through the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns selecting their most valued available item, or using optimization techniques to minimize envy.

Given the valuations, let's attempt an allocation where each agent receives items in a manner that maximizes their total valuation, while keeping the distribution fair:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 4, 5, and 6.
- **Agent 1** values item 5 highly.
- **Agent 2** values items 3, 2, and 5 highly.
- **Agent 3** values items 0, 1, and 2 highly.

Here is one possible allocation that tries to give each agent items they highly value:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [0, 6] - high value for item 0 and a good value for item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Item [5] - high value for item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Items [2, 3] - high value for items 2 and 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Items [1, 4] - reasonable value for items 1 and 0, but item 4 is less contested.

This allocation attempts to balance total valuations while making sure no agent feels significantly envious of another's allocation.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
