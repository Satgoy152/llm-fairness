Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  53  91  51  41  72  43
1  65  79  21  14  30  74  68
2  10  69   3  70  63  12   7
3  72  95  30  11  74  68  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we will use principles from fair division. A common goal is to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations, let's try to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocated items. Since we only have 7 items and 4 agents, some agents will have more items than others, but we'll aim to make the allocation fair based on their valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:

1. **Item 1 (highest value):**  
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 95.  
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

2. **Item 2 (second highest value):**  
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 91.  
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 0 (next highest value):**  
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 72 (already has item 1).  
   - Agent 1 values it second highest at 65.  
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 5 (next highest value):**  
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 72 (already has item 2).  
   - Agent 1 values it second highest at 74 (already has item 0).  
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4 (next highest value):**  
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 74 (already has item 1).  
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

6. **Item 3 (next in value):**  
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 70.  
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

7. **Item 6 (last item):**  
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 71 (already has items 1 and 4).  
   - Agent 1 values it second highest at 68 (already has items 0 and 5).  
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the individual satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each item is allocated. Note that Agent 2 gets fewer items, but the item allocated to them is the one they value the most among the unallocated ones.
