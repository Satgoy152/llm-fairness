Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  94   4  19  40  28  53
1   7  89  34  37  59  79  20
2   1  96  59  64  28  83  92
3  20  49  32  15  27  90  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20 49 32 15 27 90 31]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for a distribution where each agent either maximizes their total valuation and/or feels that they are not envious of another agent's allocation. Given the table of valuations, one method to achieve this is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum envy or minimizing the maximum envy between agents.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuation for item 1 (94), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 5 (79) and 4 (59), so we allocate items 5 and 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 6 (92) and 3 (64), so we allocate items 6 and 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has no particularly high valuations left, but item 0 (20) is their highest, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Item 2 is left unallocated. It has the highest valuation by Agent 2, but since Agent 2 already has 2 items and Agent 3 has only 1, we allocate item 2 to Agent 3 to ensure fairness in terms of quantity distributed.

This allocation strives to balance both the quantity and the value each agent receives in a way that no agent is particularly envious of another.

Here is the resulting allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all 7 items are allocated.
