Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  22  51  68  71  78  98
1  65  77  94  43   8  51  55
2   2  44  91  92  65  69  24
3  22  92  98  13  71  90  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use a strategy that considers the agents' valuations and attempts to balance the distribution. A common approach is to use the "envy-free" allocation method, which aims to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate each agent's total valuation of all items.
2. Use a round-robin or other systematic approach to assign items iteratively, ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly, while keeping an eye on the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 54 + 22 + 51 + 68 + 71 + 78 + 98 = 442
- Agent 1: 65 + 77 + 94 + 43 + 8 + 51 + 55 = 393
- Agent 2: 2 + 44 + 91 + 92 + 65 + 69 + 24 = 387
- Agent 3: 22 + 92 + 98 + 13 + 71 + 90 + 58 = 444

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Start with the agent who values the most for a specific item and give them that item.
2. Rotate through agents to ensure an even distribution of items.

Following this approach:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 6, so assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 2, so assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 3, so assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 1, so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Next, assign items based on the next highest values that haven't been assigned yet:
  - **Agent 0** gets item 5.
  - **Agent 3** gets item 4.
  - **Agent 1** gets item 0.

Checking the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 0
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4

This distribution ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and it minimizes potential envy among the agents. Now, let's format the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
