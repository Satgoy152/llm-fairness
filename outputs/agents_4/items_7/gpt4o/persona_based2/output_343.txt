Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  49  45  21  66  31  16
1  19   8   9   1  80  31  87
2  37  45  51  94  75  16  45
3  79  75  19  92  28  40  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a manner that is fair and minimizes envy among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. This approach tries to ensure that the least satisfied agent is as satisfied as possible. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 3** has a very high value for item 0 (79) and item 3 (92). Allocating these items to agent 3 maximizes their utility.

2. **Agent 1** highly values item 6 (87) and item 4 (80), so we allocate these items to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** has a high value for item 2 (51) and item 1 (45). Allocating these items to agent 2 is beneficial for maximizing their satisfaction.

4. **Agent 0** will receive the remaining item, item 5 (31), which is a moderate value for them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, thus reducing potential envy. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation fulfills the requirement of assigning all 7 items in total while minimizing envy among the agents based on their valuations.
