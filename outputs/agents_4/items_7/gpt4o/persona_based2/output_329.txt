Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  59  18  76  29  89   6
1  96  58  81  25   3  99  43
2  31  21  33  72  94  46  36
3  33  30  24  89  76  74  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to achieve a division where no agent envies another. This can be challenging, especially with integer constraints and the need to allocate all items. One common approach is to use a round-robin or envy-free algorithm adapted to discrete items, but here we'll manually attempt a fair distribution based on the given valuations.

Let's examine a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values are highest for item 5 (89).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values are highest for item 5, but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest is item 0 (96).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is for item 4 (94).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value is for item 3 (89).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 6):

- **Agent 0** has a remaining high value for item 3, but it's taken. Next is item 6 (6), which is low for everyone.
- **Agent 1** has a high remaining value for item 2 (81).
  - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** has items 0 and 4 allocated. Next highest is item 6 (36).
  - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** has item 3. Remaining is item 1 (30), which is relatively high compared to others left.
  - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

This gives us:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [4, 6]
- Agent 3: [3, 1]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts a fair division by ensuring each agent gets items they value highly, given the constraints.
