Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  53  58  69  66  90  97
1  69   3  83  40  88  67  73
2  57  85  16  30  98  51  42
3  96   2   9  82  44  16   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent is assigned an integer number of items, it's important to consider the concept of envy-freeness. However, given the discrete nature of the problem and the limited number of items, it might not be possible to achieve perfect envy-freeness, but we can aim to minimize envy.

The goal is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated. This can be approached by considering the agents' valuations and attempting to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocation as highly as possible.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 3**: They highly value item 0 (96). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 0**: They highly value item 6 (97). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2**: They highly value item 4 (98). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 1**: They highly value item 4 (88) but it is already taken. Their next highest is item 2 (83). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0**: Their highest remaining value is item 5 (90). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 2**: Their highest remaining value is item 1 (85). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 1**: Their highest remaining value is item 3 (40). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

After these allocations, the distribution is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4
- Agent 3: Item 0

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.

{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0]
