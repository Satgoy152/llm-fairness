Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  77  83  38  28   2  90
1  62   8  17  25  70  27  22
2  96  43  39  77  54  98  19
3  78  17   6  24  12  97  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62  8 17 25 70 27 22]

 [78 17  6 24 12 97 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the challenge of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we'll strive for an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations**: Firstly, identify the items with the highest valuations for each agent to maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (90).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (70).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (98).
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (97), but since item 5 is already taken, we look for the next best available item, which is item 0 (78).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**: Distribute the remaining items to maintain a balance and minimize envy:
   - Items left are 1, 2, 3.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest value, 83).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (next highest available value, 17).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest available value, 77).

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 6, 2
   - Agent 1: Item 4
   - Agent 2: Items 5, 3
   - Agent 3: Items 0, 1

This allocation considers maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
