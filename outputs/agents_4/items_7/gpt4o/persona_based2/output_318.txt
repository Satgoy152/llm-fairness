Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  49  87  27  80  55  38
1  20  75   3  13  73  42   5
2  50  78  63  71  15  87  95
3  56  10  62  96  16  61  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes each agent's perceived value of their bundle. We'll use a simple greedy algorithm to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initialize**: Create an empty allocation for each agent.

2. **Allocation Process**:
   - Iteratively, for each item, determine which agent values it the most.
   - Assign that item to the respective agent.
   - Remove the assigned item from consideration.

3. **Result**: Ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives items according to their highest preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 2 (50)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 1 (75)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (87)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 3 (96)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (80)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 2 (87)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 2 (95)

Based on the above allocation process, here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 5, 6],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, minimizing potential envy among agents.
