Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  94  36  45  87  79  86
1  76  59  45  74  74  16  81
2  26  38  67  30  95  82  36
3   4  83  69  68  37  83  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This problem is related to the classic problem of fair division in computational economics.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**: We have 4 agents and 7 items. Our goal is to allocate these items such that the distribution is as fair as possible.

2. **Strategy**: A common approach to ensure fairness is using a method similar to the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" where each agent picks their most preferred available item in turns. However, I'll consider the valuations to ensure that each agent is getting a fair share based on their valuations.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - First, we will identify the most valued items by each agent and try to allocate them without causing significant envy.
   - We will aim to balance the total value each agent receives rather than just focusing on the number of items.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (94), so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (76), so we allocate item 0 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (95), so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the most (83), so we allocate item 5 to agent 3.
   - For the remaining items, balance the allocations to minimize envy:
     - Allocate item 6 to agent 0 (since agent 0 values it 86).
     - Allocate item 2 to agent 3 (since agent 3 values it 69).
     - Allocate item 3 to agent 1 (since agent 1 values it 74).

5. **Check Fairness**:
   - After the allocation, ensure that no agent feels another agent's allocation is better than their own considering their preferences.

6. **Final Allocation**: Based on the above steps, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and ensures that each agent has a fair representation of their preferences given the constraints.
