Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  71  55  50  55  53  25
1  54  94  79   4  22   3  50
2   1  12   0  87  90  21  72
3  16  17  59  33  80  73  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents based on the given valuations, we want to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

A common approach to achieve this is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion, where an allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. It's often challenging to achieve perfect envy-freeness, but we aim to get as close as possible.

Let's begin by analyzing the given values:

- **Agent 0** values items as follows: [20, 71, 55, 50, 55, 53, 25]
- **Agent 1** values items as follows: [54, 94, 79, 4, 22, 3, 50]
- **Agent 2** values items as follows: [1, 12, 0, 87, 90, 21, 72]
- **Agent 3** values items as follows: [16, 17, 59, 33, 80, 73, 37]

Consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (94), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** highly values items 4 (90) and 3 (87), so we allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 3** values item 5 (73) highly, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** values item 2 (55) highly, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
5. **Remaining items**: 0 and 6. 

   - For item 0, Agent 1 values it at 54, which is higher than any other agent's valuation, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - For item 6, Agent 2 values it at 72, which is the highest valuation compared to the other agents, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

This allocation aims to minimize envy by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4, 6
- Agent 3: Item 5

Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
