Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  75  43  33  39  96  81
1  54  23  93  61  47  28  67
2  96  64  46  48  38  50  65
3  62  15  96  66  95  97  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to minimize envy, we can use a fair division method such as the "Envy-Free Matching" or "Maximum Nash Welfare" approach. These methods aim to distribute items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own and the overall welfare is maximized.

Let's consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items as evenly as possible, considering each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations on item 0 (87), item 6 (81), and item 5 (96).
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation on item 2 (93).
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations on item 0 (96), item 6 (65), and item 5 (50).
4. **Agent 3**: High valuations on item 3 (66), item 4 (95), and item 5 (97).

We will make allocations that attempt to balance these preferences:

- **Item 0**: Highly valued by agents 0 and 2. Assign to agent 2 (value 96).
- **Item 1**: Assign to agent 0 (value 75) as it is not highly valued by others.
- **Item 2**: Assign to agent 1 (value 93), as it is the highest for them.
- **Item 3**: Assign to agent 3 (value 66), as it's their high preference.
- **Item 4**: Assign to agent 3 (value 95), as it's their high preference.
- **Item 5**: Highly valued by agent 0 (value 96) and agent 3 (value 97). Assign to agent 3.
- **Item 6**: Assign to agent 0 (value 81) as agent 2 has already received item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their high valuations where possible, aiming to minimize envy.

Here is the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their given valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.
