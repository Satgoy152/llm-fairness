Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  91  47   5  25  29  42
1  81  77   7  61  67  93  98
2   9  21  42  11  37  67   9
3  82  17  52  88  61  38  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with respect to their valuations, we can use an algorithm that aims for envy-freeness or at least tries minimizing envy. Envy-freeness is achieved if each agent believes that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation given their own valuation.

We can start by considering a strategy like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that is still available. However, a more nuanced approach would be to allocate items in such a way that tries to balance the total value received by each agent according to their own valuations.

Let's proceed with an example allocation using a heuristic method:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 1 (91), 0 (49), and 2 (47).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 6 (98), 0 (81), and 5 (93).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 5 (67), 4 (37), and 2 (42).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value items: 3 (88), 0 (82), and 2 (52).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, repeat the process with remaining items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Remaining high-value items: 0 (49), 2 (47).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Remaining high-value items: 5 (93) is taken, so 0 (81), 4 (67).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Remaining high-value items: 4 (37), 2 (42), 0 (9).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Remaining high-value items: 0 (82) is taken, so 2 (52), 4 (61).
   - Allocate item 4 is taken, so no more.

Now, check the remaining item 7 (if necessary), but since we've allocated all items, we adjust:

Here's the final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 0]
- Agent 1: [6, 4]
- Agent 2: [5, 2]
- Agent 3: [3]

Json representation of the allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed.
