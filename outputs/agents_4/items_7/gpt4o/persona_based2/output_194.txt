Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  74   9  37  84  80   0
1  87   2  61  16   7  59  61
2  49  53  27  49  65   1  60
3  64  71  88  19  42  40  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87  2 61 16  7 59 61]
 [49 53 27 49 65  1 60]
 [64 71 88 19 42 40 69]]
Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. This typically involves trying to maximize each agent's total value from their allocated items while ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Valuations Table:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  74   9  37  84  80   0
1  87   2  61  16   7  59  61
2  49  53  27  49  65   1  60
3  64  71  88  19  42  40  69
```

We need to distribute the 7 items among 4 agents. Let's try to allocate items by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valued items are 4 (84), 5 (80), 1 (74).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valued items are 0 (87), 2 (61), 6 (61).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valued items are 4 (65), 6 (60), 1 (53).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valued items are 2 (88), 1 (71), 6 (69).

Given that some items are highly valued by multiple agents, let's aim to allocate them in a way that balances total values.

- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (highest value 87).
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (second highest value 74).
- Assign item 2 to agent 3 (highest value 88).
- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (second preference 37, agent 1’s and 3’s preference is lower).
- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (highest value 84).
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 (second highest value 59).
- Assign item 6 to agent 2 (highest value 60).

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 3, 4] (values 74, 37, 84; total = 195)
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 5] (values 87, 59; total = 146)
- **Agent 2**: Item [6] (value 60; total = 60)
- **Agent 3**: Item [2] (value 88; total = 88)

This allocation distributes all 7 items with consideration of high-value preferences and envy-freeness.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2]
}
```
