Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  67  28  60  79  30  76
1   7  46  62  71  98  88  26
2  24   9  94  44  33  24  81
3  46  51  15  24  55  60  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim for envy-free and equitable distribution based on the given valuations. The challenge is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, given there are more items than agents.

Let's start by analyzing the total valuations for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 361
- Agent 1's total value: 398
- Agent 2's total value: 309
- Agent 3's total value: 295

One potential approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign items to agents such that each feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1**: Has the highest total valuation. Let's prioritize high-value items for Agent 1 to minimize envy:
   - Item 4 (value 98)
   - Item 5 (value 88)
   
2. **Agent 0**: Has the second highest total valuation. Assign high-value items next:
   - Item 1 (value 67)
   - Item 6 (value 76)

3. **Agent 2**: Assign remaining high-value items:
   - Item 2 (value 94)
   - Item 3 (value 44)

4. **Agent 3**: Assign the remaining item:
   - Item 0 (value 46)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that are valued highly by themselves, and the distribution is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
