Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  76  53  97  12  79  78
1   9  78  62  77  29   1  90
2   8  98  56  90  59  54   5
3  68  29  33  83  61  55  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [68 29 33 83 61 55 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we consider both the distribution of the total value and the number of items, aiming to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 58 + 76 + 53 + 97 + 12 + 79 + 78 = 453
- Agent 1: 9 + 78 + 62 + 77 + 29 + 1 + 90 = 346
- Agent 2: 8 + 98 + 56 + 90 + 59 + 54 + 5 = 370
- Agent 3: 68 + 29 + 33 + 83 + 61 + 55 + 87 = 416

Next, we attempt to allocate the items to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items that are highly valued by them.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritizing items 3 and 5 due to their high value for Agent 0 (97 and 79, respectively).
2. **Agent 1**: Item 6 has the highest value for Agent 1 (90).
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 2 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Items 0 and 4 are highly valued by Agent 3 (68 and 61, respectively).

Now, we have:

- Agent 0 has items 3 and 5.
- Agent 1 has item 6.
- Agent 2 has item 1.
- Agent 3 has items 0 and 4.

This totals 6 items, so we need to allocate 1 more item.

Agent 0 can take item 2, as it adds reasonable value without much envy for others.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.
