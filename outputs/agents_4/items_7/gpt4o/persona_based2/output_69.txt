Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  42  42  64  65   9  71
1  70  29  16  73  12  28  17
2  99  81  41  16  41  26  29
3  53  84  11   7   2  91  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division as much as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent based on their own valuation.

To approach this problem, we will use the following methodology:
1. Identify the highest valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation if it doesn't lead to unfairness or envy.
3. Adjust allocations to balance the distribution of items among agents.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 99. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most at 84. Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it at 42, but Agent 0 values other items more, so we assign it to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 73. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 65. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most at 91. Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most at 71. Assign to Agent 0.

After this allocation, each agent has a fair share of items based on their highest valuations. Let's now present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 4 and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 5.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and distribute items according to the agents' preferences.
