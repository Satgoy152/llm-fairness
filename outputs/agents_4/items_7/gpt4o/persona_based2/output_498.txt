Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  78  77  90  30   3  54
1  97  27  77  81  48   1  31
2  36  50  60  97  73  40  15
3  65  86  47  30  68  19  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the preferences of each agent for the items, we can use a method such as the "maximum marginal utility" approach to allocate items. This involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, one at a time, and ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items.

Let's proceed with this step-by-step:

1. **Assign Item 3:**
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 97.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

2. **Assign Item 0:**
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 97.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Assign Item 1:**
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 86.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

4. **Assign Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 77.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

5. **Assign Item 4:**
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 73.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

6. **Assign Item 6:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 54.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

7. **Assign Item 5:**
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 40.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now let's compile the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items to the agents in a manner that respects their valuations, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
