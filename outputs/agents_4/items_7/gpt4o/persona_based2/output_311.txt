Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  59  23  38  82  50  32
1  17  54   2  11  41   9  56
2  87  78  44  98  38  68   1
3  88  41  89  24  94  54  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to minimize envy by trying to give each agent a bundle of items that maximizes their perceived value, given the constraint that each agent should receive at least one item if possible. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valued item for each agent**: Start by assigning each agent their most valued item. This helps in minimizing envy.

2. **Distribute the remaining items**: After assigning the highest valued items, distribute the remaining items to maximize the total happiness of each agent with the least amount of envy.

Let's apply this strategy to the given table:

- **Agent 0**: The highest value is item 0 with a value of 97.
- **Agent 1**: The highest value is item 6 with a value of 56.
- **Agent 2**: The highest value is item 3 with a value of 98.
- **Agent 3**: The highest value is item 4 with a value of 94.

Now, allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 5) to achieve fairness and minimize envy:

- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most (78), but since Agent 2 already has a highly valued item (item 3), we need to distribute fairly. Agent 0 has the second-highest value (59), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 3 has the highest value for item 2 (89), so assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- **Item 5**: After distributing the previous items, Agent 2 has only one item, so assign item 5 to Agent 2 to balance the allocation.

With this allocation strategy, the items are fairly distributed among the agents. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are of high value to them, while also balancing the total count of items among the agents.
