Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  62  10  96  16  36  85
1  24  89  96  42  26  78  19
2  31  70  79  98  99  95  60
3   9  57  15  77   5  26  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we follow a systematic approach to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Given the constraints and the goal for each agent to receive an integer number of items, we will consider the valuations and try to distribute the items to maximize satisfaction for all agents.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:** First, identify the items each agent values highly to ensure that they receive at least some of their most valued items.

2. **Distribute High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly (96), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 highly (96), so we allocate item 2 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 highly (99), so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 3 (77), but since it is already taken, we look for the next best option.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Fairness:**
   - After allocating the high-value items, we distribute the remaining items by balancing the number of items each agent receives and ensuring no agent envies another's allocation.
   - Agent 0 also values item 6 (85), so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has item 1 as a high value (89), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 (95), so we allocate item 5 to agent 2.
   - Agent 3, having not received any items yet, gets item 0 (9), the remaining item.

4. **Final Check:** Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent some of their highly valued items while ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents.
