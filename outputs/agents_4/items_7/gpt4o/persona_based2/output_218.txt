Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  55  30  99  50  65  65
1  47  79  55  62  85  61  26
2  27   0   8  88  87  84   4
3  61  15  55  97   7   4   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. The goal is to ensure an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. One possible approach is to use a method like "round-robin" based on the highest valuation each agent has for the remaining items, or similarly, "maximum envy-freeness."

Here, we'll use a simple heuristic method to achieve a relatively fair allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets a fair distribution of items.

Let's review the highest valuations per item and allocate accordingly:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 0 (76).
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 1 (79).
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 3 (55).
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 0 (99).
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 2 (87).
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 2 (84).
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 0 (65).

Now, let's allocate these items to the agents:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5
- Agent 3: Item 2

Here's the json format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, while maintaining a balance in the number of items assigned.
