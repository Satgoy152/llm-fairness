Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  14  91  85  34   4  83
1  23  79  31  63  57  18   2
2  56  15  79  61  66  85  80
3  99  46  88  75  68   8  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's start by considering a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3. We can allocate these items to agent 0.
   - Items: [0, 2, 3]
   - Total Value: 63 + 91 + 85 = 239

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a preference for item 1 and item 4. We can allocate these items to agent 1.
   - Items: [1, 4]
   - Total Value: 79 + 57 = 136

3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 5 and item 6. We can allocate these items to agent 2.
   - Items: [5, 6]
   - Total Value: 85 + 80 = 165

4. **Agent 3**: This agent will not receive any items in this allocation. Although not ideal in terms of equity, this allocation allows us to maximize the total valuations for the other agents.

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3 with a total valuation of 239.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4 with a total valuation of 136.
- Agent 2 receives items 5 and 6 with a total valuation of 165.
- Agent 3 receives no items.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are highly valued to them, minimizing envy among the agents who receive items. Given the constraint of 7 items and integer allocations, this is one of the feasible solutions.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": []
}
```
