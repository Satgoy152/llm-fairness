Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  89  16   1   4  60  41
1  74  45  81   2  11  68  54
2   1  96  28  72  70  60  79
3  86  56  56  53  57  90  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction for each agent. In this case, we will try to allocate items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is as close as possible to other agents' perceived values of their allocations.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [28, 89, 16, 1, 4, 60, 41]
Agent 1: [74, 45, 81, 2, 11, 68, 54]
Agent 2: [1, 96, 28, 72, 70, 60, 79]
Agent 3: [86, 56, 56, 53, 57, 90, 59]
```

We can attempt to allocate items by considering each agent's highest-valued items that have not been claimed by another agent with a higher priority. The goal is to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (96), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (90), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (81), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** highly values item 1, but it is already taken, so we allocate their next highest, item 5, but it is also taken. Next is item 0 (28), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Now, we continue to allocate remaining items:

5. **Agent 1** values item 6 next (54), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 3** values item 0, but it’s taken, so next is item 6, but it’s taken. They value item 3 (53) next, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
7. **Agent 2** values item 6, but it’s taken, so next is item 4 (70), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

The allocation is as follows, ensuring each item is allocated and maintaining balance as much as possible:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```
