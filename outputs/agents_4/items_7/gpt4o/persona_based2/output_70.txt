Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  36  95  79  43  37  31
1  25   2  30  90  83  30  84
2  32  37  92  60  25   3   3
3  59   4  48  33  28  63  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items given to another agent over their own bundle.

Here's a step-by-step approach for the allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items per Agent**: Look for items that have significantly high valuations for specific agents, as these are likely to be the most important for those agents.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High-Value Items**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2 with a valuation of 95.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3 with a valuation of 90.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2, but since Agent 0 values it even more, consider item 0 for Agent 2, with a valuation of 32.
   - Agent 3 doesn't have any extremely high-value item compared to others, but values item 5 the highest among their options with a valuation of 63.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - After initial allocation, look to distribute remaining items in a way that balances the total value for each agent.
   - Consider remaining high-valued items for unallocated agents, and distribute to balance the perceived fairness.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Allocate items ensuring that the total number of items distributed is exactly 7 and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate based on these strategies:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 0 (High valuation for 2, and reasonable for 0)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4 (High valuation for 3, and good for 4)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (Highest remaining item valuation for agent 2)
- Agent 3: Items 1, 5 (Reasonably balanced considering remaining items)

This allocation attempts to balance the envy-freeness by distributing items based on high valuations and ensuring each agent has a fair share.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with attention to maximizing individual agent satisfaction while maintaining overall fairness.
