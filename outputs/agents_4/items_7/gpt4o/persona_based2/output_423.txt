Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  41  54  61  85  46  59
1  44  92  33  21  42  42  44
2  53   1  58  11   2  66  73
3  26  43   5  15  49  21   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that minimizes envy and ensures efficiency. A common approach is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

We can begin by examining the valuations and looking for a fair allocation. Here's a step-by-step allocation process to ensure fairness:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Check which agent values each item the most. This will serve as a guideline for potential allocations.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 50.
   - Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 92.
   - Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 58.
   - Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 61.
   - Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 85.
   - Item 5: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 66.
   - Item 6: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 73.

3. **Ensure All Agents Get Items:**
   - Since Agent 3 currently has no items, we need to ensure they receive at least one item.
   - We can reallocate Item 3 (valued at 15 by Agent 3) from Agent 0 to Agent 3, as this is the least valued item by Agent 0, and Agent 3 values it more than any other available item.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
   - Agent 1: Item 1
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 5, and 6
   - Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and it attempts to minimize envy by considering highest valuations and redistributing accordingly.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5, 6],
    "3": [3]
}
```
