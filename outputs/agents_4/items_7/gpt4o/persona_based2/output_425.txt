Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  20  96  64   3  61  25
1  65  24  73  79  43  33  70
2  57  18  92  14  84  58  93
3   1  24  82  94  23  78  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 20 96 64  3 61 25]
 [65 24 73 79 43 33 70]
 [57 18 92 14 84 58 93]
 [ 1 24 82 94 23 78 97]]
Output:
To solve the fair division problem with the goal of achieving envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A division is envy-free if no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent to their own, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  20  96  64   3  61  25
1  65  24  73  79  43  33  70
2  57  18  92  14  84  58  93
3   1  24  82  94  23  78  97
```

We can approach this problem by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives while minimizing potential envy. One common method is to use a greedy algorithm, assigning items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest at 96.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest at 79.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the highest at 93.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the highest at 97, but it's already assigned, so we assign item 3, which is their second highest valued item at 94.

Continuing in this manner, while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 84, highest for Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 24, highest available for Agent 1).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 84, highest for Agent 2 among remaining).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (value 78, highest for Agent 3 among remaining).

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

Agent 0: Items 0, 2 (valuations: 84, 96)
Agent 1: Items 1, 3 (valuations: 24, 79)
Agent 2: Items 4, 6 (valuations: 84, 93)
Agent 3: Item 5 (valuation: 78)

This distribution ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution is aiming to be fair based on individual preferences.

Final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [5]
}
```
