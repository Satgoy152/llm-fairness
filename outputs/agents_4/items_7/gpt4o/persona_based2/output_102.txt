Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  30  12  52  35  53  25
1   2  81  50  67  25  99  71
2  10  44  70  49  52  98  80
3  55  17  79  68  46  86  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a strategy such as the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most preferred available item. However, we'll adjust it slightly by considering the valuations and aiming to balance the total value assigned to each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has a strong preference for item 5 (value 99) and item 1 (value 81).
2. **Agent 3** values item 2 (value 79) highly.
3. **Agent 2** has a strong preference for item 6 (value 80).
4. **Agent 0** has a strong preference for item 3 (value 52).

Given these preferences and trying to balance the total value, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0 (value 31) and item 3 (value 52). Total value = 31 + 52 = 83.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (value 81) and item 5 (value 99). Total value = 81 + 99 = 180.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 6 (value 80). Total value = 80.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 2 (value 79) and item 4 (value 46). Total value = 79 + 46 = 125.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the number of items is balanced as evenly as possible given the preferences.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
