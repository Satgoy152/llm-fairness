Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  58  92  43  38  17   2
1  28  73  25  89  96  70  44
2  11  71  19  69  29  19   6
3   7  36   4  12  82  44  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to minimize envy and maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. One common approach to achieve this is through the Envy-Free algorithm, which ensures that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent.

Let's evaluate the allocation step by step:

1. **Assess Total Valuations**: 
   - Agent 0: [86, 58, 92, 43, 38, 17, 2]
   - Agent 1: [28, 73, 25, 89, 96, 70, 44]
   - Agent 2: [11, 71, 19, 69, 29, 19, 6]
   - Agent 3: [7, 36, 4, 12, 82, 44, 16]

2. **Greedy Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent based on their preferences, ensuring that each item is only assigned once.
   - We aim for each agent to have at least one item, if possible, given their preferences.

3. **Allocation**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0 and overall).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1 and overall).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest remaining value for Agent 2).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (highest remaining value for Agent 3).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

This ensures that:
- Each agent gets at least one item (except for Agent 2, but given the valuations and limited items, this is optimal).
- Total valuation is maximized for each agent based on their preferences.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items fairly and considers the highest preferences for each agent as much as possible.
