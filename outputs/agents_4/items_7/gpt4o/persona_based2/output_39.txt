Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  82  35  68  69  70  75
1  57  29  98  41  34  52  36
2  67  11  10  99  50  19  34
3  74  68  87  27  62  99  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 29 98 41 34 52 36]
 [67 11 10 99 50 19 34]
 [74 68 87 27 62 99 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that the allocation minimizes envy among the agents. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 72, 82, 35, 68, 69, 70, 75
Agent 1: 57, 29, 98, 41, 34, 52, 36
Agent 2: 67, 11, 10, 99, 50, 19, 34
Agent 3: 74, 68, 87, 27, 62, 99, 76
```

To minimize envy and ensure a fair allocation, we can start by allocating the most valued items to each agent and then distribute the remaining items such that no agent would prefer another's allocation.

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (82).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (98).
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (99).
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most (99).

Allocate these high-value items first:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Now consider the remaining items: 0, 4, 6.

Let's allocate the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 has item 1 (value 82). Assign item 0 (value 72) to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has item 2 (value 98). Assign item 6 (value 36) to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has item 3 (value 99). Assign item 4 (value 50) to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 has item 5 (value 99) and will not receive any more items as it already has the highest value item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations, and reduces overall envy.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
