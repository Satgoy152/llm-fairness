Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  95  13  83  98  88  83
1  24  90  70  58  59  41  67
2  78  26  92  64  59  61  52
3  85  75  61  29  79  73  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items to agents in a manner that minimizes envy and attempts to achieve a fair division, we can use a strategy known as the "envy-free allocation." This involves allocating items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

We will follow these steps to derive an envy-minimized allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuations:**
   Each agent's top-valued items are primarily considered to ensure they receive at least some high-value items according to their preferences.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   Distribute the items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets a substantial portion of their top-valued items.

3. **Adjust for Balance:**
   Reallocate any remaining items to balance the distribution and ensure each agent receives a near-equal share in terms of their total valuation.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation items: 4 (98), 1 (95), 
   - Allocate item 4 and 1 to agent 0 initially.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation items: 1 (90), 2 (70)
   - Item 1 has already been allocated to agent 0. Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation items: 2 (92), 0 (78)
   - Item 2 has already been allocated to agent 1. Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation items: 0 (85), 6 (90)
   - Item 0 has already been allocated to agent 2. Allocate item 6 to agent 3.

5. **Reallocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items 3 and 5 are unallocated.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1 and item 5 to agent 3 based on balancing the total valuation across agents.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed. Note that while perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable with discrete items, this allocation attempts to minimize envy and balance total valuations among the agents.
