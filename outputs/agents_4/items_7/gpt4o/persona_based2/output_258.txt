Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  66  49  76  50  71  49
1  60  10  79  55  76  98  24
2  67  63  41  41  34  39  95
3  20  17  64  44   0  46  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, and ideally no agent feels envious of another's allocation. Given the table of valuations, a common approach is to use the "round-robin" method or to manually allocate items based on the agents' highest valuations.

Let's go through the valuation table to determine the allocations:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:** 86, 66, 49, 76, 50, 71, 49
2. **Agent 1's valuations:** 60, 10, 79, 55, 76, 98, 24
3. **Agent 2's valuations:** 67, 63, 41, 41, 34, 39, 95
4. **Agent 3's valuations:** 20, 17, 64, 44, 0, 46, 35

To ensure a fair division, we can start by assigning each agent their most valued item, if it hasn't already been allocated, then continue to allocate the next highest valued available item to each agent in a round-robin fashion. Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (value 86) and item 3 (value 76).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (value 98) and item 2 (value 79).
- **Agent 2** highly values item 6 (value 95).
- **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (value 64), but since it's valued higher by Agent 1, they can take the next highest valued available item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Assign items [0, 3].
- **Agent 1:** Assign items [5, 2].
- **Agent 2:** Assign item [6].
- **Agent 3:** Assign items [1, 4].

This allocation considers each agent's preferences without overlapping, and all items have been allocated. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
