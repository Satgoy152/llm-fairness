Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  39  12  61   9  45  43
1  79  79  23  38  51  97   0
2  18  33  29  81  77  46  11
3  42  39  33  95  45   2  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To tackle the problem of fairly allocating items to agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. Our goal is to achieve a fair distribution where each agent receives the maximum possible value from the items allocated to them, while ensuring that no agent is envious of another's allocation.

Let's first consider each agent's preferences:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (92), followed by item 3 (61).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (97), followed by items 0 and 1 (both 79).
- **Agent 2** values item 3 (81) the most, followed by item 4 (77).
- **Agent 3** values item 3 (95) the most, followed by item 0 (42).

Given these preferences, let's allocate items to maximize fairness and minimize envy:

1. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 1**: This item has the highest valuation (97) for Agent 1, and it is their top preference.
2. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: This item has the highest valuation (92) and is the top preference for Agent 0.
3. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 3**: This item is the highest valued (95) for Agent 3.
4. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 2**: This item is the second highest preference for Agent 2 (77) and not yet allocated.
5. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**: This item has a high valuation for Agent 1 (79) and is unallocated.
6. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This item, although not very highly valued, can be allocated to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.
7. **Allocate item 6 to Agent 0**: This item can also be allocated to Agent 0 to complete the allocation.

Now, we have allocated all 7 items as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [3]

This allocation tries to respect the highest preferences and balance the number of items to reduce potential envy.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
