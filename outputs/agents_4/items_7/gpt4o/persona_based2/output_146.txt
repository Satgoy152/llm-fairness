Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  40  37  64  97  83  49
1  66  28  11  12  58  26  19
2  17   9  27  96  70  88  29
3  67  93  68  47  51   7  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation received by any other agent, according to their own valuations. Given the complexity of achieving envy-freeness with integer allocations and the relatively small number of items, a heuristic approach can be used to balance the allocations:

1. **Identify High Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (value = 97).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value = 66).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most (value = 88).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (value = 93).

2. **Allocate One High Value Item to Each Agent:**  
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are: 2, 3, 6.
   - Allocate these items trying to balance the total value for each agent.

4. **Balanced Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Already has item 4 (value = 97).
   - Agent 1: Already has item 0 (value = 66).
   - Agent 2: Already has item 5 (value = 88).
   - Agent 3: Already has item 1 (value = 93).

5. **Consider Remaining Items:**
   - Item 2: Assign to Agent 3 (Agent 3 values it at 68).
   - Item 3: Assign to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it at 96).
   - Item 6: Assign to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 49).

This allocation considers high-value items for each agent and attempts to balance the remaining items to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation results in each agent receiving at least one item they highly value, and attempts to distribute remaining items in a way that balances the total perceived value across agents.
