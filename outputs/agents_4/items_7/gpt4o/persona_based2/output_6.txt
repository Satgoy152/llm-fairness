Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  99  41  88  30   5   2
1  22  77  94  53  71  37  31
2  30  10  75  50  44  66  62
3  40  80  80  15  93  65  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the four agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as those given to any other agent. Given the valuations, let's attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Receive items that they value relatively more compared to others. We'll allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0. 
   - Valuation: 6 (item 0) + 99 (item 1) = 105

2. **Agent 1**: We can allocate items that Agent 1 values highly such as item 2 and item 4.
   - Valuation: 94 (item 2) + 71 (item 4) = 165

3. **Agent 2**: Items 5 and 6 are allocated to Agent 2, as they have relatively higher valuations for these items.
   - Valuation: 66 (item 5) + 62 (item 6) = 128

4. **Agent 3**: Finally, we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Valuation: 15 (item 3)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and makes use of all 7 items. The total number of items allocated equals 7, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3]
}
```
