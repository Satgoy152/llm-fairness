Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50   5  37  61  91  97  56
1   3   8   6  45  39  43  34
2  92   4  91  52  34  81  70
3  98  22  16  64   7  20   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation where no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuations. This is a complex problem, but I'll attempt to provide a solution that minimizes envy as much as possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (50).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (45).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (92).
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (98).

2. **Resolve conflicts for item 0:**
   - Since item 0 is highly valued by agents 0, 2, and 3, we need to allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation: Agent 3.

3. **Allocate remaining high-value items:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 5 (97).
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (39).
   - Agent 2 gets item 2 (91).

4. **Allocate remaining items to balance the allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1 (5) and 6 (56).
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (45).
   - Agent 3: Item 0 (98) and 4 (7).

### Final Allocation:

Now, we will present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints, with each agent receiving items and minimizing potential envy.
