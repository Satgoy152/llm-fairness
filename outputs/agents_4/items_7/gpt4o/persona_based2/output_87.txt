Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  19  34  52  64  63  37
1  67  89  95  35  25  10  86
2  82  54  60  21  28  76  91
3  22  77  55  11  59  97  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for a distribution where no agent feels envious of another's allocation. This typically involves ensuring that each agent perceives their bundle to be at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuations.

Given the provided valuations, we can use a heuristic approach to assign items in a way that tries to minimize envy. One common approach is to use a “round-robin” or “sequential” allocation method, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item until all items are allocated. However, since I’m providing the allocation directly, I'll attempt to balance the valuations manually.

Below is a possible allocation that attempts to distribute items in a way that considers agents' preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritizes item 0 (value 79), item 4 (value 64)
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritizes item 2 (value 95), item 6 (value 86)
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritizes item 5 (value 76), item 3 (value 21)
4. **Agent 3**: Prioritizes item 1 (value 77)

Given the above preferences, a balanced allocation could look like this:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 4]
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 6]
- Agent 2 receives items [5]
- Agent 3 receives items [1, 3]

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they highly value while ensuring all items are assigned.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item they value highly, thus attempting to minimize envy among agents.
