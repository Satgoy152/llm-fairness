Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  30  97  23  69  62  41
1  81  80  13  48  66  95  69
2  43  76  31   1  88  47  41
3  24  27  68  57  10  61  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, or at least as close to envy-free as possible, given the discrete nature of items. The valuations provided will guide how we distribute the items to maximize fairness.

Hereâ€™s one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 97. 
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 at 95.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 88.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most at 57.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

5. **Agent 1:** 
   - Agent 1 also values item 0 highly at 81.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

6. **Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 30, which is the highest remaining value for them.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

7. **Agent 2:** 
   - Agent 2 values item 6 at 41, which is the highest remaining value for them.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 2.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, taking into account their preferences as best as possible.
