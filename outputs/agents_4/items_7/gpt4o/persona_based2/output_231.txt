Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  90  29  40  82  85  16
1  86  43  75  43  99  85  95
2  19  40  30  39   4  80  17
3  45  21  25  29  49  45  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [45 21 25 29 49 45 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free division, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation. Given the values, we will consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while being fair to all agents.

Let's examine the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 61 + 90 + 29 + 40 + 82 + 85 + 16 = 403
- Agent 1: 86 + 43 + 75 + 43 + 99 + 85 + 95 = 526
- Agent 2: 19 + 40 + 30 + 39 + 4 + 80 + 17 = 229
- Agent 3: 45 + 21 + 25 + 29 + 49 + 45 + 35 = 249

We will try to allocate items such that the envy between agents is minimized, considering their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 4 (Highest Value for Agent 1):**
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (99). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1 (High Value for Agent 0):**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 highly (90). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 5 (Valuable for Agent 0 and 1):**
   - Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value item 5 at 85.
   - Since Agent 1 already got item 4, we allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 6 (Valuable for Agent 1):**
   - Agent 1 values item 6 highly (95). Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 0 (Valuable for Agent 1):**
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 86. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

6. **Item 3 (Valuable for Agent 3):**
   - Agent 3 values item 3 at 29. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

7. **Item 2 (Remaining Item):**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 has received fewer items compared to others.

### Final Allocation:

Now, we ensure that each agent has at least as many items as possible while balancing the total number of items allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the fairness by ensuring that each agent gets a set of items that maximizes their valuations, while minimizing envy. Agent 2 receives no items in this allocation due to their significantly lower valuations across the board.
