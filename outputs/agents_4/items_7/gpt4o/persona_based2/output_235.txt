Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  60   9  30  30  69  86
1  49  57  37  76  67  63   3
2  32  46  29  64   2  36  65
3  20  83  87  27  84  31  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for a division that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. One way to approach this is by using a method like the "round-robin" allocation or an optimization approach that considers the overall valuations and attempts to balance them.

Here's an attempt to allocate the items based on the provided valuations to try and achieve a fair division:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their relative valuations.

   - Agent 0's total valuation: 310
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 352
   - Agent 2's total valuation: 274
   - Agent 3's total valuation: 394

2. Allocate items by trying to maximize each agent's total valuation while minimizing envy:

   - Agent 3 has the highest total valuation and values item 2 the most. Assign item 2 to agent 3.
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most. Assign item 6 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the second most. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most. Assign item 5 to agent 2.
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the second most. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the second most. Assign item 0 to agent 1.

3. Check the number of items each agent has and adjust if needed to ensure all items are allocated and no agent is left without items if possible.

Now, here is a possible allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item. This is one attempt to balance the allocations based on their preferences and valuations while ensuring each agent gets a positive integer number of items.
