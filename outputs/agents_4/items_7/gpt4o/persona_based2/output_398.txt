Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  30  85  24  46  20  46
1  17  19  85  89  76  16  50
2  13  39  97  97  80  20  82
3   1  37  61  72   4  70  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly at 85, which is the highest value for agent 0.
- Agent 1 values items 2 and 3 highly, with both at 85 and 89 respectively.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 4, with values of 97, 97, and 80.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 72, followed by item 5 at 70.

To ensure a fair allocation, we need to balance these valuations and distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuations for items 2, 3, and 4. Allocating these to Agent 2 gives them a strong share, minimizing their potential envy. 

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 2 and 3 as well. However, since these are already allocated to Agent 2, we should allocate other items to Agent 1. Items 4 and 6 have relatively high values for Agent 1. However, since item 4 is already with Agent 2, we allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2, but since it is already given to Agent 2, we can allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0, which are relatively higher in their valuations.

4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 3, but since it is allocated to Agent 2, we allocate item 5 to Agent 3, which is their next highest valued item.

5. Finally, item 6, which has not been allocated yet, should be given to Agent 0 or Agent 1. Given that Agent 1 values item 6 more than Agent 0, we allocate it to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 6
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 5

Final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
