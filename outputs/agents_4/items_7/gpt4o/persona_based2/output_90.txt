Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  66  45  65  20  58  90
1  20  78  40  94  76  86  78
2  85  51  32  20   5  36  24
3  89  96   3   2  61  88  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels that they have received a fair share according to their valuations. We'll use a heuristic approach to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction while maintaining fairness.

First, let's summarize each agent's total valuation for all items to better understand their preferences:

- Agent 0: Total valuation = 345
- Agent 1: Total valuation = 472
- Agent 2: Total valuation = 253
- Agent 3: Total valuation = 421

Now, let's allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. Let's allocate the remaining items (2, 4, and 5) while considering the remaining preferences to maintain fairness.

5. **Agent 1**: Assign item 5, as it has a high valuation (86) for Agent 1.
6. **Agent 3**: Assign item 4, as it has a relatively high valuation (61) for Agent 3.
7. **Agent 0**: Assign item 2, as it has the highest remaining valuation (45) for Agent 0.

Now, all items are allocated. Each agent should feel that their allocation is fair based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
