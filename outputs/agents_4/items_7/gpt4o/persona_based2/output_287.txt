Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  32  58  52  96  32  53
1  70  74  46  59  43  10  23
2  78  22  24  54  59  33  63
3  75  49  88  91   9  83  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution as much as possible. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible, we can aim for a fair distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 351
- Agent 1's total valuation: 325
- Agent 2's total valuation: 333
- Agent 3's total valuation: 447

To reach an allocation, we can prioritize giving each agent items where they have relatively high valuations compared to the others. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (96)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (74), Item 0 (70)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (63), Item 0 (78)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 2 (88)
   - Allocate Item 2 and Item 3 to Agent 3.

After this initial allocation based on highest valuations, we need to ensure all items are allocated. Two items remain: Item 5 and Item 0.

5. **Remaining Item Allocation**:
   - Item 5 has relatively low valuations across all agents, so assign it to an agent needing more items. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Item 0 can be re-evaluated for allocation since Agent 2 and Agent 1 both have high valuations. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

This is a potential allocation that tries to maximize the perceived fairness based on initial preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their highest preferences, while ensuring all items are distributed.
