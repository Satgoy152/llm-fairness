Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90   6  76  67  30  27  17
1   5  96  16  93  23   9  45
2  17  64  40  83  10  65  42
3  37   7  92  92  82  69  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they are getting at least as much value as they perceive would be possible by another allocation. We will use a method that considers maximizing the minimum value each agent gets based on their own valuations.

First, let's review the total values each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 90 + 6 + 76 + 67 + 30 + 27 + 17 = 313
- Agent 1: 5 + 96 + 16 + 93 + 23 + 9 + 45 = 287
- Agent 2: 17 + 64 + 40 + 83 + 10 + 65 + 42 = 321
- Agent 3: 37 + 7 + 92 + 92 + 82 + 69 + 58 = 437

Given that there are 7 items, each agent should ideally get about 1.75 items, but since each must get an integer number, we will need to balance the allocations carefully.

Here is a possible fair allocation based on maximizing each agent's perceived value:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 90 for Agent 0, highest for Agent 0 compared to others).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 96 for Agent 1, highest for Agent 1 compared to others).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value 92 for Agent 3, higher than other agents).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 93 for Agent 1, highest for Agent 1 compared to others).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 82 for Agent 3, higher than other agents).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 65 for Agent 2, highest for Agent 2 compared to others).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 42 for Agent 2, higher than other agents).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy while ensuring everyone gets an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation is designed to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
