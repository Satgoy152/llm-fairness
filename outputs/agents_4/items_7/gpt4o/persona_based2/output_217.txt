Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  17  92  11  10  52  29
1  64  82  10  47  52  47  16
2  22  97  33  41  34  15  52
3  14  47  33  81  95  70   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, one way to approach this is by using algorithms like the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division algorithms. However, these can be complex and computationally intensive.

For simplicity in this case, we can manually balance the allocations based on the given valuations to ensure each agent gets items they value highly, while also considering the overall fairness. Let's try to allocate the items in a way that balances these considerations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 highly but has a unique high valuation for item 0.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly.

Considering the above, let's make the allocations:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: 2, 5
  - Explanation: Agent 0 highly values item 2. Item 5 is a secondary choice.

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: 1
  - Explanation: Agent 1 highly values item 1. 

- **Agent 2**:
  - Items: 0, 6
  - Explanation: Agent 2 has a unique high valuation for item 0 and moderate valuation for item 6.

- **Agent 3**:
  - Items: 3, 4
  - Explanation: Agent 3 highly values item 4 and has a moderate valuation for item 3.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy the high valuations of each agent as much as possible while ensuring all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item.
