Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  93  32  88  30  37  96
1  30  87   3  64   2  82  75
2  89   0   0  81  43  11  76
3  43  16  75  84  84  63  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 87  3 64  2 82 75]
 [89  0  0 81 43 11 76]
 [43 16 75 84 84 63 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over others based on their valuations.

First, let's consider the total valuations for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: 57 + 93 + 32 + 88 + 30 + 37 + 96 = 433
- Agent 1: 30 + 87 + 3 + 64 + 2 + 82 + 75 = 343
- Agent 2: 89 + 0 + 0 + 81 + 43 + 11 + 76 = 300
- Agent 3: 43 + 16 + 75 + 84 + 84 + 63 + 97 = 462

We can proceed by allocating the items to the agents based on who values them the most:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 2 (89).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 0 (93).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 3 (75).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 0 (88).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 3 (84).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 1 (82).
7. **Item 6**: Highest value by Agent 3 (97).

Now, let's assign the items based on these highest valuations while ensuring the distribution minimizes envy:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 3 (values 93, 88)
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 (value 82)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (value 89)
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 4, 6 (values 75, 84, 97)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents as specified.
