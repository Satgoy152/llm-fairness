Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  20  10  57  33  72   9
1  41  31  59  82  89  21   9
2  48   9  37  53   1  34   7
3  63  28  95  70   6  15  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly to the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to find a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High Value Items**: First, identify items that are particularly valuable to specific agents and could cause significant envy if allocated to another agent. For example, item 5 is most valued by agent 0, and item 2 is most valued by agent 3.

2. **Initial Allocations Based on Highest Valuations**: Allocate items to agents who value them the highest, if possible, to minimize envy.

3. **Balance Remaining Allocations**: Allocate the remaining items in a way that balances the total value perceived by each agent, considering their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 5, 0
  - Values: 72, 28
  - Total value: 100

- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 3
  - Values: 89, 82
  - Total value: 171

- **Agent 2**: Item 1
  - Value: 9
  - Total value: 9

- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 6
  - Values: 95, 45
  - Total value: 140

These allocations ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. This allocation seeks to minimize envy by giving high-value items to the agents who value them most, while also attempting to keep the perceived total value balanced.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```
