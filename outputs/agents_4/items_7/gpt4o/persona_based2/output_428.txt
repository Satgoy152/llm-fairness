Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  42  84  26  61  57  24
1  63  11  53  67  45  83  54
2  35  73  25   9  53   5  32
3   0  59  16  36  13  74  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 11 53 67 45 83 54]
 [35 73 25  9 53  5 32]
 [ 0 59 16 36 13 74 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent should not prefer another agent's bundle over their own based on their valuations. Considering the given valuations, a potential allocation strategy is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring every item is allocated.

Let's examine the valuations matrix:

```
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6
    0  21  42  84  26  61  57  24
    1  63  11  53  67  45  83  54
    2  35  73  25   9  53   5  32
    3   0  59  16  36  13  74  76
```

We can apply a process where each agent is allocated items in a way that maximizes their utility given the constraint that each item can only be allocated to one agent.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (84), followed by item 5 (57).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (83), followed by item 3 (67).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (73), followed by item 4 (53).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (76), followed by item 5 (74).

By assigning items based on these preferences and ensuring no item is allocated more than once, we arrive at the following allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item 2.
- **Agent 1**: Gets items 0 and 3.
- **Agent 2**: Gets items 1 and 4.
- **Agent 3**: Gets items 5 and 6.

This allocation attempts to respect the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring every item is allocated.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation is designed to balance the total valuations and distribute the items fairly among the agents, given their preferences.
