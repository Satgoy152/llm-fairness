Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  79  61  71  77  52  98
1   4  22   6   6  88  32  30
2  22  54  89  77  31  57  10
3  57  28  22  61  90  26  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, the goal is to allocate items to agents such that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation minimizes envy among the agents. The concept of envy-freeness suggests that each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the table of valuations, we can attempt to find an allocation that is as fair as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations provided:

```
Agents' Valuations:
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0: 18  79  61  71  77  52  98
Agent 1:  4  22   6   6  88  32  30
Agent 2: 22  54  89  77  31  57  10
Agent 3: 57  28  22  61  90  26  75
```

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 6 (value 98). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 4 (value 88). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 2 (value 89). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 4 (value 90), but it's already allocated. Next best: item 0 (value 57). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. Let's proceed with the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0**: Already has item 6. Next best is item 3 (value 71). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1**: Already has item 4. Next best is item 5 (value 32). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 2**: Already has item 2. Next best is item 1 (value 54). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

All 7 items are now allocated. Let's summarize the allocation:

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning each agent their most valued items based on availability, while ensuring that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
