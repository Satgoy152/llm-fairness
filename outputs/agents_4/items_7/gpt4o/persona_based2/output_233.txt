Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  74  53  66  54  86  60
1  96  93  54  40  81  56  68
2  40  46  39  33  24   5  24
3   9   5  85  94  57  20  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 74 53 66 54 86 60]
 [96 93 54 40 81 56 68]
 [40 46 39 33 24  5 24]
 [ 9  5 85 94 57 20 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we want to aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  74  53  66  54  86  60
1  96  93  54  40  81  56  68
2  40  46  39  33  24  5   24
3   9   5  85  94  57  20  13
```

Let's attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is as balanced as possible given the agents' preferences.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify Preferences:** First, observe the highest values each agent assigns to the items for potential priority allocation.
2. **Initial High-Priority Allocations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (value 97).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (value 93).
   - Agent 2 does not have high valuations, but item 2 (value 39) is relatively highest for them.
   - Agent 3 highly values item 3 (value 94).

3. **Further Allocation:**
   - Remaining items 4, 5, and 6 need to be allocated considering remaining capacities and minimizing envy.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   After assigning high-priority items, distribute the remaining items to balance the allocation for envy-freeness.

### Allocations

Following this strategy, here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 4
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Items 2 and 3

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while respecting initial high-priority preferences.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 7 items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and attempts to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
