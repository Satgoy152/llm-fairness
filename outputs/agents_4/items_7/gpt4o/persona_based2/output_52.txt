Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  57  65  79   0  39  89
1  34   9  89  57  62  36  67
2  31  80  22   7  45  24  24
3  12   8   6  78  24  58  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for Item 6 (89) and Item 3 (79). 

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for Item 2 (89).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is for Item 1 (80).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is for Item 5 (58) and Item 4 (24).

We aim to allocate based on these preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate Items [3, 6]
  - Valuations: 79 (Item 3), 89 (Item 6)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate Items [2]
  - Valuation: 89 (Item 2)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate Items [1]
  - Valuation: 80 (Item 1)
- **Agent 3**: Allocate Items [0, 4, 5]
  - Valuations: 12 (Item 0), 24 (Item 4), 58 (Item 5)

Let's check if this allocation satisfies the fair division principles:

- Agent 0 receives their two highest valued items.
- Agent 1 receives their highest valued item.
- Agent 2 receives their highest valued item.
- Agent 3 receives three items, none of which are highly valued by the other agents, but collectively they offer a reasonable valuation.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives either their most valued item or a fair share of relatively less valued items.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
