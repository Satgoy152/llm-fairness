Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  46  19  20  12  70  47
1   2  20  32  79  99  77  32
2  70  64  92   3  85   9   8
3  47   1  22  55  49  54  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 20 32 79 99 77 32]

 [47  1 22 55 49 54 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations in the table, we can apply a method to approximate envy-freeness, such as the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division techniques.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (70) and 6 (47).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (99) and 3 (79).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (92) and 0 (70).
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (55) and 5 (54).

Considering these preferences and aiming for fairness, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items 5 and 6. These are among their highest valued items.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items 3 and 4. These are their highest valued items.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items 0 and 2. These have high value for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1. This is left while maximizing value for Agent 3.

This allocation tries to maximize the happiness of each agent by considering their highest valued items while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items while attempting to respect their respective valuations.
