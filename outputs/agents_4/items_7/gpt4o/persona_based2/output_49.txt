Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  77  47   7  66  58  17
1  23   7   2  46  33  43  19
2  20  21   9   8  99  82  18
3  48  25  82  80  89  77  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73 77 47  7 66 58 17]
 [23  7  2 46 33 43 19]
 [20 21  9  8 99 82 18]
 [48 25 82 80 89 77 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness to the extent possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuations.

### Valuations Table:
```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0: 73  77  47   7  66  58  17
Agent 1: 23   7   2  46  33  43  19
Agent 2: 20  21   9   8  99  82  18
Agent 3: 48  25  82  80  89  77  87
```

### Strategy:
1. **Identify High Value Items**: Determine which items are valued highly by each agent.
2. **Allocate Uniquely Valued Items**: If an item is valued significantly higher by one agent than others, allocate that item to that agent.
3. **Balance Remaining Items**: Distribute remaining items to balance overall satisfaction.

### Steps:
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item the most (73), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 again values this item the most (77), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 3 values this most (82), so allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values this most (80), so allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values this most (99), so allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values this second highest (82), so allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 values this highest (87), so allocate to Agent 3.

### Resulting Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1]
- Agent 1 gets no items []
- Agent 2 gets items [4, 5]
- Agent 3 gets items [2, 3, 6]

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation is designed to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their highest valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.
