Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  80  33  35   9  65  28
1  21  49  10  65  70  32  97
2  31  55  51  84  25  91  53
3  17  30  48  51  52  54   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, minimizing any potential envy for the allocations of others. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - We have 4 agents and 7 items. 
   - Each agent values the items differently, and we want to distribute the items such that each agent feels like they have a fair share.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Focus first on assigning high-value items to each agent to maximize their satisfaction.
   - Balance allocations so that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuation.

3. **Allocating Items**:
   - Start by assigning unique high-value items to agents based on their preferences.
   - Adjust the remaining items to balance the overall value distribution.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0: Valuations are highest for item 1 (80).
- Agent 1: Valuations are highest for item 6 (97).
- Agent 2: Valuations are highest for item 5 (91).
- Agent 3: Valuations are moderately distributed, but item 3 (51) is relatively high.

Given these observations, a possible allocation is:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1, as it has the highest value for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Item 6, as it has the highest value for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Item 5, as it has the highest value for Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Item 3, as it has a significant value for Agent 3.

Now to allocate the remaining items (0, 2, 4):

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 as it has a decent value (26) for them and balances their allocation.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 as it provides a decent additional value (70).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 as it adds a fair value (51).

Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations across agents, giving each one a set of items they value highly.
