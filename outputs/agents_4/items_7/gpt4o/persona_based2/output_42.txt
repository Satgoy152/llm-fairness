Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  15  13  31  25  84   2
1  39  36  22   0  25  81  72
2  44  66  92  27  42  71  54
3  66  50  90  60  54  43  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels that another agent received a better bundle of goods according to their valuations.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [35, 15, 13, 31, 25, 84, 2]
- Agent 1: [39, 36, 22, 0, 25, 81, 72]
- Agent 2: [44, 66, 92, 27, 42, 71, 54]
- Agent 3: [66, 50, 90, 60, 54, 43, 85]

A possible allocation strategy is to prioritize allocating items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that the overall distribution is fair and envy-free.

Considering these valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 92. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 84. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most at 85. Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
4. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 66. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most at 66. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
6. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most at 60. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
7. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most at 54. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now let's ensure all agents have been allocated fairly:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [1, 2]
- Agent 3: [0, 3, 4, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value highly, and no agent envies another, given the distribution of their highest-valued items.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
