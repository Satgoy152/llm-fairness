Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  67  91  15  22  86  23
1  36  61  96  71  29  80  96
2  69  79  53  22  49  63   0
3  80  24   4  90  29  34  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[18 67 91 15 22 86 23]
 [36 61 96 71 29 80 96]
 [69 79 53 22 49 63  0]
 [80 24  4 90 29 34 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the valuations. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own.

### Steps for Allocation:
1. **Identify Strong Preferences**: Look for items where agents have significantly higher valuations compared to others. This can help in reducing envy.
2. **Consider Total Valuation**: Balance the total valuation for each agent to ensure fairness.
3. **Iterate for Envy-freeness**: Adjust allocations to minimize envy, checking if any agent would prefer another's allocation.

### Calculation:
Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 has a strong preference for item 2 (91).
- Agent 1 values item 2 (96) the most, and also item 6 (96).
- Agent 2 values item 1 (79) the most.
- Agent 3 values item 3 (90) the most and also item 0 (80).

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 1**: High value for items 2 and 6, so allocate both to Agent 1.
- **Agent 3**: High value for item 3, allocate it to Agent 3.
- **Agent 0**: High value for item 5, allocate it to Agent 0.
- **Agent 2**: High value for item 1, allocate it to Agent 2.

Now, we have left items: 0, 4.

Allocate remaining items to balance total valuation:
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 0.
- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 4 to balance the number of items.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [5, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 6]
- **Agent 2**: Items [1]
- **Agent 3**: Items [3, 0]

This allocation aims to balance the strong preferences and distribute the items fairly, minimizing envy as much as possible.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```
