Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  18  32  59  29  91  32
1  15  50  13  99  93  20  95
2  53  32  45  60  48  14  65
3  24  86  76  53  72  85  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. However, it's crucial to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations to determine an allocation that maximizes fairness:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [14, 18, 32, 59, 29, 91, 32]
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (value 91)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [15, 50, 13, 99, 93, 20, 95]
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (value 99)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [53, 32, 45, 60, 48, 14, 65]
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (value 53)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [24, 86, 76, 53, 72, 85, 26]
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (value 86)

Let's allocate these highest valued items first to each agent. This gives:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 1

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 2, 4, and 6. Let's allocate these based on the next highest value for the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 2, 4, 6

Evaluating the next highest valuations for these items:

- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 0: 32
  - Agent 1: 13
  - Agent 2: 45 (highest)
  - Agent 3: 76 (next highest)

- **Item 4:**
  - Agent 0: 29
  - Agent 1: 93 (highest)
  - Agent 2: 48
  - Agent 3: 72 (next highest)

- **Item 6:**
  - Agent 0: 32
  - Agent 1: 95 (highest)
  - Agent 2: 65
  - Agent 3: 26

Allocate based on these:

- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 4

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2
- Agent 3: Items 1, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they highly value, maintaining fairness and envy-freeness to a reasonable extent.

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
