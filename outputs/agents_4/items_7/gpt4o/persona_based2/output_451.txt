Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  30  58  56  11  45  65
1  98  94  64  81  96  38  65
2  60   7  34  60  12  62  27
3  31  70   1  55  86  93  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we should aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. In this case, each agent values items differently, so an allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction should be the goal.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 2. Let's allocate item 0 to agent 0, as it's the most valued by them.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most. Let's allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has higher valuations for item 5 compared to other items. So, allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a very high valuation for item 5, but since item 5 is already taken, let's allocate item 6 to agent 3 as it is the next valued item.

Now, we have allocated:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [6]

Next, we need to allocate the remaining items 2, 3, and 4. Let's consider the remaining highest valuations:

5. **Item 2**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation after their first choice, but since they already have their top choice, we should consider others. Agent 1 has a reasonable valuation for item 2. Let's give item 2 to agent 1.
6. **Item 3**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation after their first choice, but since they already have two items, let's give item 3 to agent 0 to balance allocations.
7. **Item 4**: Agent 1 has a very high valuation, but to balance the number of items, let's allocate item 4 to agent 3, who has high valuations for items and only has one item so far.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [4, 6]

Let's put this into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
