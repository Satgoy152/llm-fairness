Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  36  24  90  75  42  14
1  81   5  31  66  70  25  12
2  81  45  79  53  82   9  84
3  25  97   5  10  30  47  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 45 79 53 82  9 84]
 [25 97  5 10 30 47 72]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 very highly (94), the highest among all agents for any item. Allocating item 0 to Agent 0 is a strong start.
   - Next, Agent 0 values item 3 highly (90), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (70), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the most (84), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 2 also values item 2 highly (79), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 (97) among all agents. Thus, item 1 is allocated to Agent 3.
   - Lastly, Agent 3 values item 5 (47) more than other agents' highest values for unallocated items, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 6.
- Agent 3 receives items 1 and 5.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. The allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent items they highly value.
