Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  78  54  80  98  76  96
1  64  95  15  91  32  12  76
2  62  72  15  16  64  24  25
3  63  29  85  40  17   2  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that reflects their preferences as equitably as possible. One way to achieve this is by using the concept of "envy-freeness," which means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations provided for each agent and try to distribute the items to maximize overall satisfaction while maintaining fairness:

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [51, 78, 54, 80, 98, 76, 96]
- Agent 1: [64, 95, 15, 91, 32, 12, 76]
- Agent 2: [62, 72, 15, 16, 64, 24, 25]
- Agent 3: [63, 29, 85, 40, 17, 2, 90]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** Look for items that have significantly higher valuations for particular agents compared to others, to allocate them preferentially.

2. **Iterative Allocation:** Start by assigning each agent the item for which they have the highest relative valuation, ensuring no conflicts. Resolve conflicts by reallocating items based on second preferences or by comparing total value satisfaction.

3. **Check Envy-Freeness:** After initial allocation, adjust as necessary to ensure no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items [4, 5] (Values: 98, 76)
- **Agent 1:** Items [1, 3] (Values: 95, 91)
- **Agent 2:** Items [0] (Value: 62)
- **Agent 3:** Items [2, 6] (Values: 85, 90)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are relatively high on their preference list, minimizing envy among agents.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation assigns each agent an integer number of items, and all 7 items are distributed as required.
