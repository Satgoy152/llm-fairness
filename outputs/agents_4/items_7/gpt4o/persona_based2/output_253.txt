Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  72  37  37  51  12  27
1  57  91  38  47  36   4  43
2  55  20   0  76   3  59  91
3  64  92  31  84  90  92  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to balance the total values each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, let's start by evaluating which items are most valuable to each agent and attempt a distribution that equalizes perceived value as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items 0 and 1 highly (72 each). Let's allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the highest (91), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 3 (47). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the highest (91). Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the highest (92), but it's taken. Next highest is item 5 (92). Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now let's allocate the remaining items (2, 4) to maintain balance:

- **Agent 1**: Item 4 has a value of 36 for Agent 1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as it's one of the remaining items and relatively valuable to them.
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 has a value of 31 for Agent 3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

At this point, items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 have been allocated.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute items in a way that balances the total valuation received by each agent, reducing envy and ensuring each agent gets items they value highly.
