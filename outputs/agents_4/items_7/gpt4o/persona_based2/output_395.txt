Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  41  15  93  38  15  21
1  26   2  73  58  91  77  90
2  47  23  43   5  32   8  39
3  80  56  20  94  96   3  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a fair manner while considering envy-freeness, we will use a method that aims to minimize envy among agents. A common approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" allocation strategy, which ensures that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent values theirs.

Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items and Preferences:**
   - For each agent, identify items they highly value.
   - For example, Agent 3 highly values item 4 the most (value 96), and Agent 1 highly values item 6 (value 90).

2. **Maximize High-Value Allocation:**
   - Assign high-value items first to reduce potential envy.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 96).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 90).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Use a balanced approach to distribute the remaining items to ensure no agent is left envious of others.
   - Consider the remaining items and allocate them to agents based on their remaining high valuations.

4. **Re-evaluate and Adjust:**
   - Check if any agent is envious of anotherâ€™s allocation and adjust if needed.

Following this approach, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [3, 5].
- Agent 1 receives items [6].
- Agent 2 receives items [0, 1].
- Agent 3 receives items [2, 4].

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
