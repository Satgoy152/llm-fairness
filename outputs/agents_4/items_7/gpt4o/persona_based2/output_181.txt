Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  97  66  10  23  24  65
1   0  93  39  66  78  52  16
2  47  81  58  46  92  81  41
3  86  49  98   0  75  22  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure an allocation that minimizes envy and is as equitable as possible according to the given valuations. One approach to achieve this is by using the "Envy-Free" principle, which seeks to ensure that no agent prefers the allocation of items given to another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the given valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (97)
   - Next highest valuations: Item 2 (66), Item 6 (65)
   - Allocate: Items 1, 2, 6 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (78)
   - Next highest valuations: Item 3 (66)
   - Allocate: Items 3, 4 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (92) but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest valuations: Item 5 (81)
   - Allocate: Item 5 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (98) but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest valuations: Item 0 (86)
   - Allocate: Item 0 to Agent 3

### Final Allocation:

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, aiming to minimize envy and distribute the items as fairly as possible given the constraints.
