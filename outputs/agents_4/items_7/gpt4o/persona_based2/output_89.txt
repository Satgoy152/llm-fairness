Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  11  53  31  15  22   7
1   3  17  74  26  25  42  51
2  72  84  10  38  36  97  72
3  97  36  98  54  93  67  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the 7 items to the 4 agents in a way that considers the agents' valuations and ensures an envy-free or as close to envy-free allocation as possible. This type of problem often involves complex mathematical tools and algorithms, but here we'll attempt a practical approach that considers the agents' preferences and attempts to balance them.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify the Highest Valued Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (74).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (97).
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (98).

2. **Initial Allocation of Highest Valued Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 3 has other high-value items).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (next highest value for Agent 3).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items by Value Preferences:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 4, 6.
   - For item 1, Agent 2 has the highest value (84), assign to Agent 2.
   - For item 4, Agent 3 has the highest value (93), assign to Agent 3.
   - For item 6, Agent 1 has the highest value (51), assign to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
After considering the preferences and attempting to distribute items fairly, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects the high-value preferences of each agent, aiming for a balanced distribution of total value while ensuring all items are allocated. Each agent receives at least one item, with the allocations aiming to minimize envy among the agents.
