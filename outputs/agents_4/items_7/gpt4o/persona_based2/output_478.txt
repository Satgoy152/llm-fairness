Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  78  42  22  18  12  33
1  17  32   0  99  87   7  87
2  69  44  46  98  32  27  79
3  89  82  66  10  83  21  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate these items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. A common approach is to use algorithms like the Adjusted Winner Procedure, Divide and Choose, or other fair division methods. However, due to the integer constraint, some compromises will be necessary.

Here is one potential allocation that attempts to maximize fairness and minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 1, and 2. However, item 0 has high valuations from multiple agents. We can give agent 0 item 0, which they value at 95.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 99. Assign item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has high values for items 3 and 6, but since item 3 is already assigned, we assign item 6 to agent 2, which they value at 79.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 0 highly, but it is already assigned to agent 0. We can assign item 4 to agent 3, which is valued at 83 by them.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items considering the next best available options for each agent:

5. **Remaining Items (1, 2, 5)**:
   - Agent 0 can get item 1, which is the next highest for them after item 0.
   - Agent 2 can get item 5, which they value more than any other agent.
   - Agent 3 can get item 2 as it has a decent value for them and no other agent finds it significantly better.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.
