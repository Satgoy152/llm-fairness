Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  39  66  87  36  48  13
1  68  24   5  56   7  60  89
2  55  85  94  87  36  25  34
3  65  32  80  24  16  33   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a manner that strives for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation and attempt to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 62     | 39     | 66     | 87     | 36     | 48     | 13     |
| 1     | 68     | 24     | 5      | 56     | 7      | 60     | 89     |
| 2     | 55     | 85     | 94     | 87     | 36     | 25     | 34     |
| 3     | 65     | 32     | 80     | 24     | 16     | 33     | 8      |

A good approach is to assign items based on the highest relative valuation by each agent. Here's one way to allocate:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 3 highly (value 87).
2. **Agent 1**: Strongly prefers item 6 (value 89).
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 2 (value 94).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 (value 65).

Assign these highest preference items first. Then, allocate the remaining items considering the next highest preferences without causing envy:

- **Agent 0**: After getting item 3, they also prefer item 5 (value 48).
- **Agent 1**: After getting item 6, they can also take item 4 (value 7).
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 2, and can take item 1 as it holds a relatively high value (value 85).
- **Agent 3**: After receiving item 0, can also take item 5 (value 33).

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 6
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 2
- **Agent 3**: Items 0, 5

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
