Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  61  95  23  28  98  47
1  75  37  27  93  43  51  58
2  29  42   7  71  92  53  30
3   2   5   0  86  88   2  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free or approximately envy-free division, where each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own.

To approach this, we'll use a simple allocation strategy by considering the valuations and trying to balance them across the agents:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 at 98, which is the highest single valuation among all agents.
   - Allocating item 5 to Agent 0 maximizes their perceived value.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 93, which is their highest valuation.
   - Allocating item 3 to Agent 1 satisfies their highest interest.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 at 92, which is their highest valuation.
   - Allocating item 4 to Agent 2 satisfies their highest interest.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 4 at 88, which is close to their highest valuation of 86 for item 3, but since item 4 is already allocated, they get item 6, which is their next highest valuation (42).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 1, 2) to the agents in a way that maintains fairness:

- Agent 0, having received item 5 already, should get items that balance their total value.
  - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it provides a higher total value increment (39).

- Agent 1 has received item 3 at 93. To balance further:
  - Assign item 2 to Agent 1, which gives them a total of 120.

- The remaining item, 1, can be assigned to Agent 3, who has received item 6.
  - This gives Agent 3 a slight boost in total valuation.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6, 1]
}
```

This distribution aims to balance the value across the agents while respecting their highest preferences, ensuring a fair division of items.
