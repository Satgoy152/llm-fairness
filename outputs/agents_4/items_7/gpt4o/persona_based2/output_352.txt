Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  87  82  44  61  44  36
1  90  45  33  77  98   3  16
2  90  41  70  38  66  34   5
3  94  85  92  92  54   2  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items that another agent receives more than their own bundle. We will aim to distribute the items so that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation.

Here is a step-by-step approach to determine an envy-free allocation:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: Initially, identify items that have particularly high valuations for specific agents, which could be critical for achieving envy-freeness.

2. **Initial Allocation Attempt**: Assign items to agents based on maximizing individual satisfaction while considering envy-freeness. 

3. **Iteration and Adjustment**: Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed and to minimize any potential envy.

4. **Final Allocation**: Ensure that all items are allocated and that the distribution is as fair as possible.

Based on the given valuations, here's a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values items 1 and 2.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 4.
- **Agent 2** can take item 0.
- **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 3 and 6.

Given these observations, here's one possible allocation that attempts to be envy-free:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6

This allocation tries to balance the high valuations each agent has for certain items while ensuring all items are fairly distributed.

Here's the final allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
