Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78   5  72  58  12  74  82
1  67  65   4  52  71  32  59
2  43  10  12  89  61  10   5
3  85  85  62  83  86  89  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78  5 72 58 12 74 82]
 [67 65  4 52 71 32 59]
 [43 10 12 89 61 10  5]
 [85 85 62 83 86 89 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among 4 agents based on their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their utility and minimizes envy among agents.

The given table of valuations is:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78   5  72  58  12  74  82
1  67  65   4  52  71  32  59
2  43  10  12  89  61  10   5
3  85  85  62  83  86  89  27
```

Let's analyze the valuations to find the allocation that is as envy-free as possible:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuations in several categories: items 0 (85), 1 (85), 3 (83), 4 (86), and 5 (89). To maximize fairness, we can assign Agent 3 the items they value highly and that are not the top choice for other agents. Thus, allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 3.

2. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (78), 2 (72), and 6 (82). As item 0 is also highly valued by Agent 3, let's assign item 2 and item 6 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 1** has moderate valuations for item 1 (65) and item 3 (52). Assign these items to Agent 1.

4. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (89), but since it's already allocated to Agent 1 and Agent 2's other valuations are relatively low, we can assign the remaining item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets items 4 and 5.

This allocation is aimed to minimize envy, although perfect envy-freeness may not be achieved due to the constraints.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
