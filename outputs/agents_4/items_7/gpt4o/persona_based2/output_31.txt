Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84   8  55  63  42  31  32
1  71  36  85  12  85  62  74
2  19  40  42  72  14  87  49
3   9  21  64  56  76  32  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their perceived value. The goal is to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints, meaning no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, if possible.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: [84, 8, 55, 63, 42, 31, 32]
- Agent 1 values items: [71, 36, 85, 12, 85, 62, 74]
- Agent 2 values items: [19, 40, 42, 72, 14, 87, 49]
- Agent 3 values items: [9, 21, 64, 56, 76, 32, 27]

We will use these valuations to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation as much as possible:

1. **Agent 1** highly values items 2 and 4 (85 each). We can allocate these items to Agent 1, as they provide significant value to this agent.

2. **Agent 2** highly values item 5 (87). Allocating this to Agent 2 would satisfy them based on their highest valuation.

3. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (84). Assigning this item to Agent 0 would be beneficial.

4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (76), but since item 4 has already been allocated to Agent 1, we consider the next highest valued item for Agent 3, which is item 2 (64). However, item 2 is also allocated to Agent 1. The next option is item 3 (56), which is available.

5. Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 1 and 6.

   - Item 1 can be allocated to Agent 2, as they value it (40) more than other unassigned agents.
   - Item 6 can be allocated to Agent 0, as they value it (32) similarly to others but have room for an additional item.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that, as per their valuations, should satisfy them reasonably well given the constraints.
