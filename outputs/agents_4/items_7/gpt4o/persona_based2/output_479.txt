Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  30  65  25  33  55  57
1  72   1  79  30  31  23  21
2  86  47  73  28  79  11  81
3  94  61  70  98  25  38   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocations are as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent should feel that they have received a fair share of the items based on their own valuations.

Here are the valuations provided:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 71     | 30     | 65     | 25     | 33     | 55     | 57     |
| 1     | 72     | 1      | 79     | 30     | 31     | 23     | 21     |
| 2     | 86     | 47     | 73     | 28     | 79     | 11     | 81     |
| 3     | 94     | 61     | 70     | 98     | 25     | 38     | 6      |

To achieve a fair division, we can consider each agent's highest valued items and attempt to allocate these without causing significant envy. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest (98). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 2** values item 6 the highest (81). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (71). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest (79). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
5. Now, consider remaining items 1, 4, and 5.
6. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 4 (79). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 1 (61). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
8. **Agent 0** can be assigned the remaining item 5 (55).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, minimizing envy as much as possible based on their individual preferences.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
