Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  37  54  92  49  11  55
1  22  72  34   6  82  75  45
2  88  73  89  91  82  12  81
3  89  66  49  90  72  22  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem of fairly allocating items among agents with the goal of minimizing envy, we should consider the valuation of items by each agent. Our aim is to distribute the items such that each agent feels that their allocation is fair or envy-free to the greatest extent possible, given the valuations.

Let's examine the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  37  54  92  49  11  55
1  22  72  34   6  82  75  45
2  88  73  89  91  82  12  81
3  89  66  49  90  72  22  13
```

The strategy is to allocate items based on the highest bidder approach, where each item is given to the agent who values it the most. However, since we have 4 agents and 7 items, we should ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while trying to balance the total valuation received by each agent.

1. **Item 0** has the highest valuation from Agent 3 (89).
2. **Item 1** has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (72).
3. **Item 2** has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (89).
4. **Item 3** has the highest valuation from Agent 0 (92).
5. **Item 4** has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (82).
6. **Item 5** has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (75).
7. **Item 6** has the highest valuation from Agent 0 (55).

Now let's ensure each agent receives at least one item, while distributing the remaining items to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (92), Item 6 (55)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (72), Item 4 (82)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (89)
- **Agent 3**: Item 0 (89), Item 5 (22)

This distribution maximizes the valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
