Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  16  97  34  98  33   0
1  10  34  61  42  47  95  13
2  98  76  71  63  98  33  22
3  29  15  10  22  90  24   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy by ensuring each agent gets a share of items that they value highly while considering the preferences of other agents. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 98 + 16 + 97 + 34 + 98 + 33 + 0 = 276
   - Agent 1: 10 + 34 + 61 + 42 + 47 + 95 + 13 = 302
   - Agent 2: 98 + 76 + 71 + 63 + 98 + 33 + 22 = 461
   - Agent 3: 29 + 15 + 10 + 22 + 90 + 24 + 1 = 191

2. **Normalize the Value of Each Item for Each Agent:**
   - Each agent's valuation of an item is divided by their total valuation to normalize values.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Begin by allocating items that have the highest valuation for any agent and are not highly valued by others, thus reducing potential envy.
   - Ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of their value.

After evaluating the valuations and considering fair allocation principles, here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2 (highest preference for these items)
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 (highest preference for this item)
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 4 (high preference and relatively less competitive)
- **Agent 3**: Items 3 and 6 (items with lower overall competition)

This allocation balances the preferences and minimizes envy among the agents.

### Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This distribution aims to give each agent items they value highly and attempts to distribute the overall value as evenly as possible given the constraints.
