Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  47  59  18  73   0  68
1   7  75  54  38  66  55  32
2  93  76  11  35  85  71  74
3  13  46  32  28  62  91  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. This means that each agent should feel that they have received a satisfactory allocation given their individual valuations.

To solve this problem, we can use a heuristic approach by allocating items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. 

Let's go through the items and assign each to the agent who values it the most:

1. **Item 0**: Valuations are [93, 7, 93, 13]. Both agents 0 and 2 value it the highest at 93. We can assign it to either. Let's assign it to agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Valuations are [47, 75, 76, 46]. Agent 2 values it the highest at 76. Assign it to agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Valuations are [59, 54, 11, 32]. Agent 0 values it the highest at 59. Assign it to agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Valuations are [18, 38, 35, 28]. Agent 1 values it the highest at 38. Assign it to agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Valuations are [73, 66, 85, 62]. Agent 2 values it the highest at 85. Assign it to agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Valuations are [0, 55, 71, 91]. Agent 3 values it the highest at 91. Assign it to agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: Valuations are [68, 32, 74, 77]. Agent 3 values it the highest at 77. Assign it to agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and is based on maximizing the value for each item given to the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents and attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
