Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  88  66   9  85  27  85
1  14  25   3  71  64   5  58
2  30  29  99  11  99   2  34
3  41  30  26  89  78  13  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to carefully consider the valuations each agent has for the items. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze and allocate the items step-by-step, considering both the valuations and the number of items each agent should receive to ensure fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 highly. We should aim to give agent 0 some of the items they value the most to minimize envy.

2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the most. This item should ideally go to agent 1 to ensure they feel satisfied with their allocation.

3. **Agent 2**: Values items 2 and 4 the most. However, giving both to agent 2 might create envy in agent 0, who also values item 4 highly.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 the most. This item should ideally go to agent 3.

Given these considerations, let's detail a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Given items 0 and 1, which are among the highest valued for agent 0 and do not create significant envy for others.
- **Agent 1**: Given item 3, as it is their highest valued item and prevents envy.
- **Agent 2**: Given items 2 and 4. Although agent 0 values item 4, giving both 2 and 4 to agent 2 aligns with their preferences without creating excessive envy due to agent 0 already having high-value items.
- **Agent 3**: Given items 5 and 6. Item 6 is the highest valued item for agent 3, and item 5 completes their allocation.

This distribution aims to balance the allocations, ensuring each agent receives items they value and minimizing envy across the agents.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
