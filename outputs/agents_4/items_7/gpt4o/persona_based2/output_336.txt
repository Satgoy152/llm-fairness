Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  76   1  78  34  45  37
1   8  35  23  42  45  51  55
2  43  36  86  76  45   9  47
3  96  18   6  50  35  38  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 76  1 78 34 45 37]
 [ 8 35 23 42 45 51 55]
 [43 36 86 76 45  9 47]
 [96 18  6 50 35 38 99]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives while ensuring the allocation is envy-free. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here is one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 3. We can assign these items to Agent 0 to maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 the most. Assigning item 5 to Agent 1 would be optimal.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 2. Assigning item 2 to Agent 2 is optimal.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 6. Assigning item 6 to Agent 3 is optimal.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6. The remaining items are 1 and 4. We will allocate these by looking at who values them relatively more:

- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most after their already assigned items, so we allocate it to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values item 4 quite well, and since Agent 1 has only one item, we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation should ensure a reasonable degree of fairness and envy-freeness given the valuations.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6]
}
```
