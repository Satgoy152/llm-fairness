Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  93  93  97   7  24  80
1  96  80  72  92   6  71  48
2  19  34  78  99  56  97  91
3  12  39  95  93  45  59  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents in a manner that minimizes envy, we can use an allocation method based on maximizing the total value for each agent while considering the possibility of envy-freeness. A simple approach is to use the "Round Robin" method or "Greedy" allocation based on the valuations each agent has for the items. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 97). We allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 96). We allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 97). We allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 95). We allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, the remaining items are 1, 4, and 6. We continue allocating these items to the agents based on their next highest preferences:

5. **Agent 0**: The next highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 1 (value 93). We allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 2**: The next highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 6 (value 91). We allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 3**: The next highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 4 (value 45). We allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated all 7 items among the 4 agents. Let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, attempting to minimize envy. Note that Agent 1 receives only one item due to their highest distinct value, while other agents receive two items each based on their preferences.
