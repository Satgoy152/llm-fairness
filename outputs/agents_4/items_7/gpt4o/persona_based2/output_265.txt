Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  37  87  36  15  94  48
1  56  80  44  43  87  79  87
2  13  58  35  68  90  99  22
3  26  56   0  51  25  27  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 37 87 36 15 94 48]
 [56 80 44 43 87 79 87]
 [13 58 35 68 90 99 22]
 [26 56  0 51 25 27 30]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to minimize envy and try to ensure each agent feels that they have received a fair share of the total value based on their valuations. One common approach to achieve this is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Good" (EF1) criterion, where envy can be eliminated or minimized by the removal of at most one item from any agent's allocation.

Given the valuations in the table, we will first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 67 + 37 + 87 + 36 + 15 + 94 + 48 = 384
- Agent 1: 56 + 80 + 44 + 43 + 87 + 79 + 87 = 476
- Agent 2: 13 + 58 + 35 + 68 + 90 + 99 + 22 = 385
- Agent 3: 26 + 56 + 0 + 51 + 25 + 27 + 30 = 215

Next, we will allocate items by considering the highest value each agent places on available items, ensuring that each agent gets a share that reflects their valuations and minimizes potential envy. Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest value for item 5 (99).
2. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest value for item 2 (87).
3. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 highly (90), more than any other agent.
4. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the most (80).
5. **Allocate item 6 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 6 (87) equally as much as Agent 2, but Agent 1 has a higher overall valuation so far.
6. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most (67).
7. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 3**: Remaining item goes to Agent 3, who values it at 51, which is the highest relative value left for them.

The allocations are now:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, and the distribution is done in a manner that attempts to minimize envy.
