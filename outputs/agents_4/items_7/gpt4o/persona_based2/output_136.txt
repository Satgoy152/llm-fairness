Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  50  38  83  67  70  29
1   4  46  13  89  88  90   7
2  58  53  90  46  49  66  16
3  80  90  77  30  92  71  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. A potential approach is to use the "round-robin" method where each agent picks their most valued item in turns, or a similar strategy that ensures a fair distribution based on preferences.

First, we rank the items for each agent based on their valuations:

- Agent 0: [3, 0, 5, 4, 1, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: [5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 0, 6]
- Agent 2: [2, 5, 1, 0, 4, 3, 6]
- Agent 3: [4, 1, 0, 5, 2, 6, 3]

Now, we proceed with an allocation plan that aims to reduce envy:

1. **First Round of Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 3 (most valued).
   - Agent 1 picks item 5.
   - Agent 2 picks item 2.
   - Agent 3 picks item 4.

2. **Second Round of Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 0.
   - Agent 1 picks item 1.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - The only item left is 6, which can be assigned to Agent 3, as they have fewer items than others.

This allocation ensures each agent gets one or more of their highly valued items, aiming to minimize envy under the constraints provided.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
