Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  64  33  59  20  68  11
1  83  30  96   4   1  40  27
2   1  47  47  81  51  38  74
3  46  31  57  60  73  16  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 4 agents while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free (if possible), we can use the Maximin Share (MMS) approach. This approach attempts to allocate items such that each agent receives at least as much value as they would if they divided the items themselves into fair shares and received the least valuable share.

To start, let's compute the total value each agent would get if they could divide the items into 4 bundles themselves:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Total Value = 61 + 64 + 33 + 59 + 20 + 68 + 11 = 316
   - Maximin Share = 316 / 4 = 79

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Total Value = 83 + 30 + 96 + 4 + 1 + 40 + 27 = 281
   - Maximin Share = 281 / 4 = 70.25

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Total Value = 1 + 47 + 47 + 81 + 51 + 38 + 74 = 339
   - Maximin Share = 339 / 4 = 84.75

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Total Value = 46 + 31 + 57 + 60 + 73 + 16 + 28 = 311
   - Maximin Share = 311 / 4 = 77.75

Next, allocate items to try to meet or exceed each agent's MMS:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Allocate items [0, 1] (values: 61, 64) for a total value of 125 (exceeds MMS of 79).

- **Agent 1**:
  - Allocate items [2, 5] (values: 96, 40) for a total value of 136 (exceeds MMS of 70.25).

- **Agent 2**:
  - Allocate items [3, 6] (values: 81, 74) for a total value of 155 (exceeds MMS of 84.75).

- **Agent 3**:
  - Allocate item [4] (value: 73) for a total value of 73 (slightly below MMS of 77.75, but this is the best possible allocation given the constraints).

These allocations utilize all 7 items and aim to meet the fair division criteria. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [4]
}
```
