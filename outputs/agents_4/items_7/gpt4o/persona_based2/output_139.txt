Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  36  69  74  64  38  49
1  23  46  12  84  53  91  89
2  89  96  44  73  55  55  30
3  21   3  32  42  88  66  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation with some degree of envy-freeness, we can start by distributing items based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. This ensures that each agent's allocation is as fair as it can be given the constraints.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 3 + 36 + 69 + 74 + 64 + 38 + 49 = 333
- Agent 1: 23 + 46 + 12 + 84 + 53 + 91 + 89 = 398
- Agent 2: 89 + 96 + 44 + 73 + 55 + 55 + 30 = 442
- Agent 3: 21 + 3 + 32 + 42 + 88 + 66 + 14 = 266

Given these total valuations, we can try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while keeping the allocation as envy-free as possible.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 2 (value 69) is most valued by Agent 0.**
2. **Item 5 (value 91) is most valued by Agent 1.**
3. **Item 1 (value 96) is most valued by Agent 2.**
4. **Item 4 (value 88) is most valued by Agent 3.**

Now, we have allocated four items, and each agent has received one item. We need to allocate the remaining items 0, 3, and 6 in a way that continues to maximize total satisfaction while maintaining envy-freeness:

5. **Item 0 (value 89) is most valued by Agent 2, who still values it highly.**
6. **Item 3 (value 84) is most valued by Agent 1.**
7. **Item 6 (value 49) is most valued by Agent 0.**

This allocation gives us a distribution where each agent has at least one item, and the allocation attempts to maximize individual agent satisfaction based on their valuations.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to minimize envy by prioritizing each agent's highest-valued items.
