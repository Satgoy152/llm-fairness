Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  24  57   6   8  60
1   9  87  23  91  97  21
2  71   0  33  50  78  35
3  50  17  89  31  27  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to look at the valuations and try to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation more than their own, if possible. Given that there are 4 agents and 6 items, each agent can receive at most one or two items.

We will attempt to assign items to agents based on maximizing their valuations while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation more than their own. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (60). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (97). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (71). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (89). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

For the remaining items (1 and 3), we need to find a suitable allocation:

5. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (87). Since Agent 1 already has item 4, we consider Agent 0, who values it as 24. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (91). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Now every agent has at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.
- Agent 3 receives item 2.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```
