Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  34  31  32  86  57
1  66  28   1  18  31   6
2  61  70   3   6  79  97
3  78  20  47  84  37  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 34 31 32 86 57]
 [66 28  1 18 31  6]
 [61 70  3  6 79 97]
 [78 20 47 84 37 16]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that they received a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Here are the steps to approach this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their overall valuation perspective.
   
   - Agent 0: 81 + 34 + 31 + 32 + 86 + 57 = 321
   - Agent 1: 66 + 28 + 1 + 18 + 31 + 6 = 150
   - Agent 2: 61 + 70 + 3 + 6 + 79 + 97 = 316
   - Agent 3: 78 + 20 + 47 + 84 + 37 + 16 = 282

2. **Determine Fair Share:** Since there are 6 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally get 1.5 items. However, since items cannot be split, we need to assign 1 or 2 items to each agent in a way that feels proportionally fair.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign items by attempting to maximize each agent's valuation for the items they receive while balancing the number of items per agent.

After considering these factors, a possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: [0, 4] (Highest values are for items 0 and 4)
- Agent 1: [1] (Highest value is for item 0, but Agent 0 values it more, so next is item 1)
- Agent 2: [5] (Highest valued item is 5)
- Agent 3: [2, 3] (Highest values are for items 3 and 2)

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's strongest preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
