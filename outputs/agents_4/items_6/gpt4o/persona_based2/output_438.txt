Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  17  51  81  85  37
1  77  74  10  62  14  97
2  84  77  14  81  65  61
3  11  27  85  49  70  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where envy is minimized and each agent receives an allocation that reflects their preferences as closely as possible. A commonly used method in fair division problems is to apply the "envy-free" concept, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

To achieve this, we can use the method of "round-robin" or "sequential allocation," where agents take turns choosing items based on their preference scores until all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the agents' preferences and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 4 (85).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 5 (97).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 0 (84).
4. **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 2 (85).

Now, we proceed with a sequential allocation based on descending order of preferences:

- **Round 1:**
  - Agent 1 picks item 5 (97)
  - Agent 2 picks item 0 (84)
  - Agent 0 picks item 4 (85)
  - Agent 3 picks item 2 (85)

- **Round 2:**
  - Remaining items are 1 and 3.
  - Agent 1 picks item 3 (62)
  - Agent 0 picks item 1 (17)

Now all items are allocated. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest available preferences, minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.
