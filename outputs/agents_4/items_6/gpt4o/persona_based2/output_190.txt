Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  99  77  32  20  41
1  26  39  80  16  31   3
2  42  63  36  85  84  89
3  88  91  25  30  80  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that is as fair as possible, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the asymmetry in valuations, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, but we will attempt to minimize envy.

One strategy is the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar approaches that attempt to balance the total perceived value of the allocations for each participant. Here's how we can proceed with the allocation:

1. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.**
2. **Ensure each agent gets a fair share by balancing the total value received.**

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most (97).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (99).
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most (80).
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most (85).
- **Item 4**: Agents 2 and 3 are close in value, but Agent 2 values it slightly higher (84).
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most (89).

Now, we'll assign the items based on the highest valuations while trying to balance the perceived value among agents:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 1 (valuation: 97 + 99 = 196)
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (valuation: 80)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 4, and 5 (valuation: 85 + 84 + 89 = 258)
- **Agent 3**: No items initially (valuation: 0)

After the initial allocation, Agent 3 has no items, which is unfair. We need to adjust to balance the fairness:

- Reallocate Item 4 from Agent 2 to Agent 3, which reduces Agent 2's total value and gives Agent 3 some value.

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1 (valuation: 196)
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (valuation: 80)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 5 (valuation: 85 + 89 = 174)
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (valuation: 80)

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of value across agents while adhering to the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
