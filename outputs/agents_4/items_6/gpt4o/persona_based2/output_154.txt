Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  31   5  91  60  41
1  99  55  27  35  57  55
2  63  49  28  54  64  33
3  72  73  13  11  30  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79 31  5 91 60 41]
 [99 55 27 35 57 55]
 [63 49 28 54 64 33]
 [72 73 13 11 30 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations. This typically involves the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [79, 31, 5, 91, 60, 41]
Agent 1: [99, 55, 27, 35, 57, 55]
Agent 2: [63, 49, 28, 54, 64, 33]
Agent 3: [72, 73, 13, 11, 30, 44]
```

One effective approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns the highest-valued item to the agent who values it the most, and then repeat the process for the remaining items. This doesn't guarantee envy-freeness but is a reasonable heuristic for fair division.

1. Item 0: Valued most by Agent 1 (99).
2. Item 1: Valued most by Agent 3 (73).
3. Item 2: Valued most by Agent 1 (27), but Agent 1 already has one item, so consider Agent 2 (28).
4. Item 3: Valued most by Agent 0 (91).
5. Item 4: Valued most by Agent 2 (64).
6. Item 5: Valued most by Agent 1 (55), but Agent 1 already has the highest value item, so consider Agent 0 (41).

Now, to ensure each agent gets a fair share, we balance the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: [3, 5]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0]
- Agent 2 receives items: [2, 4]
- Agent 3 receives items: [1]

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent, considering their preferences.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
