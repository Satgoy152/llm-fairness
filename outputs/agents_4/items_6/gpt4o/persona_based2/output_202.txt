Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  31  77  90  14   8
1   3  37  41   6  70  22
2  27  35  68  90  48  49
3  98  71  18  54  43  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 37 41  6 70 22]
 [27 35 68 90 48 49]
 [98 71 18 54 43 19]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness is achieved when no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the table of valuations to come up with a fair division:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  31  77  90  14   8
1   3  37  41   6  70  22
2  27  35  68  90  48  49
3  98  71  18  54  43  19
```

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we will try to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives approximately equal value in relation to their own preferences.

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 highly (90) and item 2 (77). We allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (70). We allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 (90) highly, but it is already allocated. The next highest is item 5 (49). We allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most (98). We allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 of the 6 items. We must allocate the remaining items (1 and 2) and ensure that the allocation remains fair.

5. **Agent 0** has item 3, which is valuable to them. Let's give them item 2 as well, which they also value highly (77).
6. **Agent 1** has item 4. For a reasonable distribution, let's give them item 1, which is their next highest valuation (37).

After this allocation, the items are distributed as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 4 and 1
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 0

This allocation respects each agent's valuations and attempts to minimize envy by ensuring that agents receive items they value highly.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
