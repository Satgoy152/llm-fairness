Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  31  19  70  60  36
1  57  57  81  49  96   1
2  97  55  64  83  53  38
3  97  17  93  29  14  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 55 64 83 53 38]
 [97 17 93 29 14 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness and attempt to ensure that each agent receives items such that none of them prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 0 (90) and item 3 (70). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 4 (96). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 0 (97), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 3 (83). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 0 (97) and item 2 (93), but both are taken. Next highest is item 5 (61). Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, we have the following items left to allocate: 1 and 2.

5. **Agent 0**: Next highest preference is item 1 (31). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 2**: Next highest preference is item 2 (64). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and we have distributed all items.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [5]
}
```
