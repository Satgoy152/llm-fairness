Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  94   9  82  92  31
1  12  51  81  94  56  54
2  23  41  97  84   9  93
3  61  38  28  86  41  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[14 94  9 82 92 31]
 [12 51 81 94 56 54]
 [23 41 97 84  9 93]
 [61 38 28 86 41 46]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the four agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their valuation while keeping the allocation envy-free, if possible. Given that each agent can only receive an integer number of items and there are a total of 6 items, we can start by considering the highest valuations for each agent and allocate accordingly. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (94). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (94). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (97). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 (61). Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

At this point, each agent has one item, and there are 2 remaining items to allocate (items 4 and 5):

5. **Remaining Items Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for both item 4 (92) and item 5 (31). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - The only remaining item is item 5, which is valued by Agent 2 at 93 (the highest among others). Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every item is allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
