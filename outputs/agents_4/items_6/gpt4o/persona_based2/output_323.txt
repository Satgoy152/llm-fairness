Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  84  50  12   4  56
1  63  70  17  50  87  94
2   6  44  92  81  80  21
3  77  49  70  67  35  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve a fair division where each agent receives an integer number of items and no agent envies another agent's allocation more than their own. We will use a strategy that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **List the items with their respective valuations for each agent:**

    - Agent 0: [58, 84, 50, 12, 4, 56]
    - Agent 1: [63, 70, 17, 50, 87, 94]
    - Agent 2: [6, 44, 92, 81, 80, 21]
    - Agent 3: [77, 49, 70, 67, 35, 21]

2. **Assign the items to agents by selecting the highest value for each item:**

   - Item 0: Highest value is 63 (Agent 1)
   - Item 1: Highest value is 84 (Agent 0)
   - Item 2: Highest value is 92 (Agent 2)
   - Item 3: Highest value is 81 (Agent 2)
   - Item 4: Highest value is 87 (Agent 1)
   - Item 5: Highest value is 94 (Agent 1)

3. **Check the allocations for fairness and envy-freeness:**

   After the initial allocation, we notice that Agent 3 hasn't received any item. Agent 1 has received three items, which might not be the most balanced allocation. To improve fairness, we need to adjust the allocations while maintaining high valuations for each agent.

4. **Refine the allocation to balance the value distribution:**

   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3 instead of Agent 1 to give Agent 3 at least one item and reduce the concentration of items with Agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (remains the same).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (remains the same).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (remains the same).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (remains the same).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (remains the same).

5. **Final Allocation:**

   Based on these steps, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive items, and the distribution attempts to balance the total value received by each agent.
