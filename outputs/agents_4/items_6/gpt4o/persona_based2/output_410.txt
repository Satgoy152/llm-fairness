Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  96  21  63  10  12
1  19  23   8  15  21  11
2  55  26  24  42   5   9
3  82   2  51  71  96   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[61 96 21 63 10 12]
 [19 23  8 15 21 11]
 [55 26 24 42  5  9]
 [82  2 51 71 96  2]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy. This often involves ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value, while also maintaining a balance across agents.

Let's examine the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  96  21  63  10  12
1  19  23   8  15  21  11
2  55  26  24  42   5   9
3  82   2  51  71  96   2
```

Agent 0 values items 0 and 1 highly.
Agent 1 values items 4 and 1 the most.
Agent 2 values item 0 the most.
Agent 3 values item 4 the most.

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 96).
2. Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 21).
3. Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 55).
4. Agent 3 gets item 3 (value 71) and item 5 (value 2).

This leaves item 2, which is valued by Agent 3 the most, so we consider giving it to Agent 3 as well.

Let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: item 1
- Agent 1: item 4
- Agent 2: item 0
- Agent 3: items 2, 3, 5

Now let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the agents' preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
