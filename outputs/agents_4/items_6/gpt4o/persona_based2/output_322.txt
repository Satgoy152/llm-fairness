Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  66  93  24  13  96
1  82  68  82   0  54  26
2  89  21  49  53  84  34
3  64  32  69  69  95  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and considers the agents' valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Look for items that have high valuations across agents, as these tend to be more contested and can generate more envy.

2. **Initial Allocation with High-Value Items:**
   - Allocate the most valued item by each agent, if possible, ensuring each gets at least one highly valued item.
  
3. **Remaining Items Allocation:**
   - Distribute the remaining items in a way that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent.

Now, let's apply this approach:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 5 (96) the most, followed by 2 (93) and 0 (86).
- **Agent 1:** Values item 0 (82) and 2 (82) the most.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 0 (89) and 4 (84) the most.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 4 (95) and 5 (75) the most.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Allocate item 5, as it's their highest value.
2. **Agent 1:** Allocate item 0, as it is highly valued by them and less so by others.
3. **Agent 2:** Allocate item 4, as it's their second highest value and highly valued by Agent 3.
4. **Agent 3:** Allocate item 3, as it's less competitive and valued by Agent 3.

Now, distribute the remaining items 1 and 2 to balance the valuations:

5. **Agent 0:** Can also be given item 2 (93), as this maximizes their overall value.
6. **Agent 1:** Assign item 1, as it adds to their value without causing significant envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent items they highly value while ensuring all items are allocated.
