Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  92  11  90  57  81
1  19  46  55  16  92  97
2  42  16  54  66  37  61
3  64  71  30  95  80  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the goal of achieving envy-freeness, we can use a simple algorithmic approach. The task is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as any other agent given their own valuations.

The given valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [49, 92, 11, 90, 57, 81]
- Agent 1: [19, 46, 55, 16, 92, 97]
- Agent 2: [42, 16, 54, 66, 37, 61]
- Agent 3: [64, 71, 30, 95, 80, 99]

We'll allocate the items to maximize each agent's happiness while ensuring that no agent envies another. One strategy is to allocate items by maximizing the total value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (92).
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the most (97).
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (66).
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most (80).

These are the highest valued items for each agent. We then allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations that do not conflict with the previously allocated items.

Continuing with the remaining items (0, 2):

- **Agent 3** values item 0 at 64, which is the highest remaining value for item 0 among unallocated agents.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 at 54, which is the highest remaining value for item 2 among unallocated agents.

Thus, the allocations can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, promoting fairness and minimizing envy.
