Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  49  94   7  65  44
1  61  72  24  95  61  32
2  16   2  40  56  52  61
3  74  73  48  12  16  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve envy-freeness and a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that there are 6 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 1 or 2 items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 94. Allocating item 2 to agent 0 makes sense as it maximizes their value.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 95. Assigning item 3 to agent 1 ensures they receive maximum value from their allocation.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 5 at 61. Allocating item 5 to agent 2 maximizes their satisfaction.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 74. Assigning item 0 to agent 3 maximizes their value.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 2, 3, and 5. We need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 4. 

5. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49, the highest among agents.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 65, which is high but Agent 1 also values it at 61.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 to balance their allocation.

The final allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle that they value highly, which should help minimize envy.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation balances the distribution across agents and attempts to maximize each agentâ€™s satisfaction with their received items.
