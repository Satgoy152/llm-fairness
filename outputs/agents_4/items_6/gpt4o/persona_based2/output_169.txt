Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  85  81  66  45  65
1  73  89  66  79  73   7
2  57  63  88  57  76  47
3  54  91  16   2  54  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints, it's important to consider the individual valuations of each agent for the items and attempt to distribute them in a way that minimizes envy. However, given that the agents must receive integer numbers of items, absolute envy-freeness may not be possible. Let's proceed with an allocation that aims to be as fair as possible.

Here are the valuations for each agent for all items:

- Agent 0: [99, 85, 81, 66, 45, 65]
- Agent 1: [73, 89, 66, 79, 73, 7]
- Agent 2: [57, 63, 88, 57, 76, 47]
- Agent 3: [54, 91, 16, 2, 54, 66]

To allocate the items, we should aim to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share. Here is a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Allocate item 0 (value 99) and item 2 (value 81). 
   - Total value for Agent 0: 180

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Allocate item 1 (value 89) and item 3 (value 79).
   - Total value for Agent 1: 168

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Allocate item 4 (value 76).
   - Total value for Agent 2: 76

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Allocate item 5 (value 66).
   - Total value for Agent 3: 66

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This configuration distributes all items among the agents, and while it may not be perfectly envy-free, it aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints of integer allocations.
