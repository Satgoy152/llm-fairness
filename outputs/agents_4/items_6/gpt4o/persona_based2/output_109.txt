Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  88  64  33  38  37
1  78  18  28   4  68  76
2  72  74   5  95  90   0
3  67  86  27  57  10  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 88 64 33 38 37]
 [78 18 28  4 68 76]
 [72 74  5 95 90  0]
 [67 86 27 57 10 37]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to allocate the items in such a way that minimizes envy among the agents. One approach is to use the Envy-Free (EF) allocation principle, which seeks to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations table for 4 agents and 6 items:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  88  64  33  38  37
1  78  18  28   4  68  76
2  72  74   5  95  90   0
3  67  86  27  57  10  37
```

We will try to allocate items to agents such that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 very highly (88), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 highly (78), and none of the other agents have a higher valuation for item 0, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 highly (95), which is the highest valuation for any item by any agent, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 highly (86), but since it's already allocated, we look at item 5 where Agent 1 has a low valuation (76), and allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. The remaining items, 2 and 4, can be allocated by checking valuations:
   - **Agent 0** can get item 2 (valued at 64), as it is the highest available value.
   - **Agent 2** can get item 4 (valued at 90), as it is the highest available value for them.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 5.

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints, ensuring each agent receives their highest available preference among the remaining items.
