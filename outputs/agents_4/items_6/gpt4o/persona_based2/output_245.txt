Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  43  43  43  40  86
1  74  10  63  40  55  46
2  23  25  92  20  30  14
3  25  62  49  13  28  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with the aim of minimizing envy, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items and try to allocate them in a way that maximizes their satisfaction while balancing the total value each agent receives. A common approach in fair division is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to assign items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 the most (86). Let's allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most (74). Let's allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most (92). Let's allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most (62). Let's allocate item 1 to agent 3.

After these allocations, we have items 3 and 4 remaining. Let's allocate them considering the remaining highest values:

- **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 4 (55). Let's allocate item 4 to agent 1.
- **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 3 (43). Let's allocate item 3 to agent 0.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, thereby reducing the potential for envy.
