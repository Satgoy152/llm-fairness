Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  50  95  36  69  82
1  38  21  18  36  31  90
2  81  71  98  62  60  19
3  27  44  43  70  67  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, I will consider both maximizing total valuation and ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible. Envy-freeness is a condition where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Given that we have 4 agents and 6 items, each agent should get at least one item while keeping envy low.

Let's evaluate a potential allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for each item.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while aiming to distribute items fairly.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0**: The most valued items are 2 (95) and 5 (82). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: The most valued items are 5 (90) and 0 (38). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: The most valued items are 2 (98), 0 (81), and 1 (71). Since item 2 and 5 are already assigned, assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: The most valued items are 3 (70) and 4 (67). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, two items remain to be allocated: items 1 and 4.

Distributing remaining items:

- **Agent 2**: Already has item 0. Assign item 1 (71) as it is the next most valuable.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 3. Assign item 4 (67) as it is the next most valuable.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's valuation and is a reasonable attempt at fair distribution given the constraints.
