Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19   8  84  78  99  30
1   9  77  35   8   4  34
2  99  68  90  90  18  42
3  19  84  43  51  95  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is challenging due to the discrete nature of items and differing valuations. Our goal is to allocate all 6 items to the 4 agents in a way that minimizes envy.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highly: 99 (item 4), 84 (item 2), 78 (item 3)
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest: 77
- Agent 2 values items highly: 99 (item 0), 90 (item 2), 90 (item 3)
- Agent 3 values items highly: 95 (item 4), 84 (item 1), 85 (item 5)

A fair allocation strategy could be as follows:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0. It is their highest valued item.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1. It is their highest valued item.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2. It is their highest valued item.
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 3. It is their higher valued item.

Now, we have two items left: items 2 and 3.

5. Assign item 2 to Agent 3. It avoids envy because Agent 3 values item 2 moderately (43), and Agent 0 already has item 4 which they value at 99.
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 2. It complements their allocation and they value it more than Agent 0.

This allocation aims to reduce possible envy by considering the highest valued items for each agent and ensuring that the items are distributed such that each agent gets at least one of their top preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5, 2]
}
```
