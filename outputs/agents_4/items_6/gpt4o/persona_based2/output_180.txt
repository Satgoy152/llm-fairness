Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  82  30  28  19  30
1  51  47  99  92   5  34
2  35  50  34  36  53  76
3  49  97  36  10  64  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation based on their valuations. Here's a strategy that can be used to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: First, identify items that have significantly high valuations for specific agents. These items should preferably be allocated to those agents to minimize envy.

2. **Balance Remaining Items**: For the remaining items, distribute them in a way that balances the overall valuation each agent receives, trying to minimize the difference in total valuation among agents.

3. **Iterative Adjustment**: If any agent feels envious based on the initial allocation, make iterative adjustments to the allocations, exchanging items between agents to improve the fairness.

Applying this approach to the given table:

- **Agent 0**: High valuations are for items 0 and 1.
- **Agent 1**: High valuations are for items 2 and 3.
- **Agent 2**: High valuations are for items 4 and 5.
- **Agent 3**: High valuations are for items 1 and 5.

By considering these valuations, the following allocation can be made:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

This allocation tries to respect high valuations while distributing items fairly. Let's format the allocation as requested:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items, while attempting to minimize envy based on their individual valuations.
