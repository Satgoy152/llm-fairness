Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  31  94  40  69  93
1  27  57  72  94  16  25
2  11  60   3  16  10  90
3  66  55  98  20  49  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27 57 72 94 16 25]
 [11 60  3 16 10 90]
 [66 55 98 20 49 94]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider a method that balances the total valuations each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation (as much as possible given the constraints).

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Determine Total Valuations:**
   Each agent has different valuations for each item. We will try to distribute items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

2. **Greedy Allocation:**
   A simple method is to allocate each item to the agent who values it most, but this can lead to unfair distributions where one agent may get significantly more total value than others. Instead, we'll aim for an approximate envy-free allocation by considering both highest valuations and balancing total allocations.

3. **Iterative Allocation:**
   We will iterate over items, assigning each to an agent such that the total valuation difference among agents is minimized.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 0:** The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (91), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (60), so allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 2:** The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (98), so allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 3:** The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (94), so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 4:** The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (69), but Agent 0 already has a high total. The next highest is Agent 3 (49), so allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 5:** The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (90), so allocate to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

This allocation method seeks to balance total valuations across agents as fairly as possible.

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns each item and attempts to balance total valuation across agents, reducing potential envy. Agent 0 receives item 0 (value 91), Agent 1 receives item 3 (value 94), Agent 2 receives items 1 and 5 (values 60 and 90), and Agent 3 receives items 2 and 4 (values 98 and 49).
