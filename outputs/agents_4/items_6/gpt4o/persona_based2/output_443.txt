Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  16  49  12   4  94
1  87  73  96  75  12  12
2  27  34  42   9  25  91
3   1  89  40  52   7  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 16 49 12  4 94]
 [87 73 96 75 12 12]
 [27 34 42  9 25 91]
 [ 1 89 40 52  7 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can use a method that focuses on maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This is a straightforward approach to ensure fairness.

Here's the allocation process:

1. **Identify Valuations**: First, let's summarize the valuations from the table:

    - Agent 0: [94, 16, 49, 12, 4, 94]
    - Agent 1: [87, 73, 96, 75, 12, 12]
    - Agent 2: [27, 34, 42, 9, 25, 91]
    - Agent 3: [1, 89, 40, 52, 7, 10]

2. **Allocate Items**:
    - Prioritize items to agents based on their highest valuation for an item that has not been allocated yet.

3. **Assignment**:
    - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 94), as it's their highest valuation.
    - Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 89), as it's their highest valuation.
    - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 96), as it's their highest valuation.
    - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 75), as it's the next highest available valuation.
    - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 25), as Agent 2 has relatively higher valuations on remaining items.
    - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 94), as it's their second highest valuation.

4. **Fairness Check**:
    - Each agent should have at least one item if possible, but given the constraints, ensure that the allocation is balanced in terms of total value received.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and the items are distributed in a way that considers each agent's highest preferences while attempting to maintain fairness.
