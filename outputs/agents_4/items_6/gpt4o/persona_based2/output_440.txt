Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  10  84  79  15  44
1  62  34  75  76   8  33
2  28  31  46  21  53  12
3   7  95  33  72  67  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 34 75 76  8 33]
 [28 31 46 21 53 12]
 [ 7 95 33 72 67 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items, considering their valuations. One possible method to achieve this is the Envy-Free Allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

We'll try to distribute the items by maximizing each agent's total valuation while keeping the allocation fair.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: [86, 10, 84, 79, 15, 44]
- Agent 1: [62, 34, 75, 76, 8, 33]
- Agent 2: [28, 31, 46, 21, 53, 12]
- Agent 3: [7, 95, 33, 72, 67, 65]

Let's allocate items step by step:

1. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest (95). Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (86). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 0** values item 2 next highest (84). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 next highest (67). Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (76) among remaining. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 2** values item 5 the highest (12) among remaining. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated. It also aims to respect their individual preferences as much as possible, given the constraints.
