Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  52  96  68  85  10
1  62  49   5  25  90  27
2  26  43  36  24  10  67
3  87  93   2   9  88  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items such that envy is minimized and, if possible, each agent feels they receive a fair share of the total value according to their valuations. Given the importance of ensuring an envy-free allocation, we will try to balance the distribution based on agents' valuations as much as possible.

Let's start by analyzing the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values: 89 + 52 + 96 + 68 + 85 + 10 = 400
- Agent 1 values: 62 + 49 + 5 + 25 + 90 + 27 = 258
- Agent 2 values: 26 + 43 + 36 + 24 + 10 + 67 = 206
- Agent 3 values: 87 + 93 + 2 + 9 + 88 + 26 = 305

Next, we attempt to find an allocation where each agent gets a fair portion of their total valuation, keeping in mind that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

One possible approach is to allocate items that each agent values highly, aiming to maximize their perceived share. Hereâ€™s one such allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items [0, 2]
  - Values: 89 (item 0) + 96 (item 2) = 185
- Agent 1: Allocate items [4, 5]
  - Values: 90 (item 4) + 27 (item 5) = 117
- Agent 2: Allocate item [1]
  - Value: 43 (item 1)
- Agent 3: Allocate items [3]
  - Value: 9 (item 3)

This allocation aims to distribute items according to each agent's preferences, taking into account their total valuation and ensuring that the total number of items allocated is six.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
