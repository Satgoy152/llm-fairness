Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  39  78  41  42  89
1  61  99  26  87  24  10
2  78  65  62   3  53  75
3  74  41  97  89  57   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 99 26 87 24 10]
 [78 65 62  3 53 75]
 [74 41 97 89 57  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle that minimizes envy, where possible. One way to approach this is to try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations while ensuring that every item is allocated.

The valuation table:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 79 | 39 | 78 | 41 | 42 | 89 |
| 1          | 61 | 99 | 26 | 87 | 24 | 10 |
| 2          | 78 | 65 | 62 |  3 | 53 | 75 |
| 3          | 74 | 41 | 97 | 89 | 57 |  2 |

Let's start by allocating items to the agents based on maximizing each agent's value for the allocated items.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 0 (79) and 5 (89).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 1 (99) and 3 (87).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 0 (78) and 5 (75), but item 0 is already allocated, so we choose item 5 for agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 2 (97) and 3 (89), but item 3 is allocated, so we choose item 2 for agent 3.

Now allocate items to ensure all items are distributed:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they highly value, minimizing envy.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
