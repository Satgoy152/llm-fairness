Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  44  22  91  55   4
1   8  17   4  69  15  76
2  47  21  92  25  17  67
3  89  61  27  19  30  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve a division where each agent feels they receive a fair share relative to their valuations. We can use the envy-free concept, which seeks to ensure that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step allocation considering the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (91) and item 4 (55), so let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (76), so let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (92), so let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (89), so let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated four items, leaving items 1 and 4 unallocated.

5. **Item 1**: The highest remaining valuation for item 1 is by Agent 3 (61), so let's allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
6. **Item 4**: The highest remaining valuation for item 4 is by Agent 0 (55), but since Agent 0 already has one high-value item, let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1, who values it reasonably (15) and has only one item so far.

After these allocations, each agent receives items that are high in their valuation, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the distribution of item values according to each agent's preferences, achieving an envy-free and fair division.
