Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  21  46  69  72  22
1  84  97  59  43  11  34
2  75  59   7  58  10   2
3   1  78  23  14   6  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent believes their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuations. Given the constraints, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all six items are allocated.

Here is one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly (72), so we will give item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (97), so we will give item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (75), so we will give item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (95), so we will give item 5 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and we need to allocate the remaining two items (items 2 and 3).

- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 0 (46), so it makes sense to allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 0 (69), so it also makes sense to allocate item 3 to agent 0.

With this allocation, each item is assigned to at least one agent, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5]
}
```
