Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  68  33  99  67  31
1  69  93  66  36  68  49
2  56  70  50  59  35  45
3  89  73  58  11  94  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 70 50 59 35 45]
 [89 73 58 11 94 91]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where no agent envies another's allocation, or the envy is minimized as much as possible. The envy-free criterion is challenging to meet in discrete allocations without compensation, but we can attempt to balance the allocations based on the agents' valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  68  33  99  67  31
1  69  93  66  36  68  49
2  56  70  50  59  35  45
3  89  73  58  11  94  91
```

We will use a greedy approach to allocate the items, trying to optimize for each agent's highest value item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, while also considering the overall fairness.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 3 (value 99).

2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 1 (value 93).

3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 1 (value 70), but it's already taken by Agent 1. Next highest is item 3 (value 59), but it's taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 0 (value 56).

4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 0 (value 89), but it's taken by Agent 2. Next highest is item 4 (value 94).

Now we have allocated 4 items: 3, 1, 0, and 4. We need to allocate two more items.

5. **Agent 0**: Next highest value among remaining items is 1 (value 68), but it's taken. Next is item 4 (value 67), but it's taken. Next is item 0 (value 50), but it's taken. Next is item 2 (value 33).

6. **Agent 3**: Next highest value among remaining items is 1 (value 73), but it's taken. Next is 5 (value 91).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets items 4 and 5.

This allocation does not perfectly meet envy-freeness, but it attempts to balance the distribution of high-valued items based on the given table.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
