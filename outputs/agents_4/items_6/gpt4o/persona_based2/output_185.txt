Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  33  69  33  22  86
1  29   3  65  61  78  29
2  26  77  55  82  19  57
3  32  97   2  78  27  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while aiming for envy-freeness, we can utilize the concept of maximizing total welfare subject to individual valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their individual valuations of the items.

The following is one possible allocation that attempts to minimize envy and maximize fairness based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0's Allocation**: We choose items that maximize Agent 0's utility considering their preferences. Items 5 and 2 have the highest values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1's Allocation**: We select items that provide the highest utility for Agent 1 which have not been taken by Agent 0. Items 4 and 3 have high values for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2's Allocation**: After allocations to Agents 0 and 1, we allocate the remaining items that maximize Agent 2's utility. Item 1 is the highest valued remaining item for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3's Allocation**: Finally, we allocate the remaining items to Agent 3. Item 0 is the only remaining item.

Let's allocate the items based on this strategy:

- Agent 0 gets items 5 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation seeks to maximize the sum of individual utilities and aims to be envy-free to the extent possible given the constraints.
