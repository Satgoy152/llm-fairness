Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  38  39  96  20  90
1  58  87  40   8  93  50
2  22   5  98  26  28  85
3   2  77  28  43  51  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an approach that considers each agent's valuation of the items. The objective is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

The valuations of the agents are as follows:

- Agent 0: [3, 38, 39, 96, 20, 90]
- Agent 1: [58, 87, 40, 8, 93, 50]
- Agent 2: [22, 5, 98, 26, 28, 85]
- Agent 3: [2, 77, 28, 43, 51, 78]

We will proceed by assigning items to agents to maximize their satisfaction and minimize envy.

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (96) and item 5 (90). Assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (93) and item 1 (87). Assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (98) and item 5 (85). Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 1 (77) and item 5 (78). Assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. At this point, items 0 and 5 are still available. Consider the remaining valuations:
   - For item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (58), followed by agent 2 (22).
   - For item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (85), followed by agent 3 (78).

6. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as they value it significantly.
7. Assign item 0 to agent 1, who values it more than other available agents.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4, 0]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]
- Agent 3: [1]

All items have been allocated, and we have attempted to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```
