Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  28  88  30  82  79
1  79  14  52  77  94  46
2   0   7  52  85  98  38
3  30  73  17  40  28  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88 28 88 30 82 79]
 [79 14 52 77 94 46]
 [ 0  7 52 85 98 38]
 [30 73 17 40 28 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method like the Envy-Free Matching or the Maximum Nash Welfare solution, which tries to balance the allocation such that no agent envies another, or at least minimizes envy.

Given the table of valuations, here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - High valuation for items 0 and 2.
   - Allocate item 0 and 2.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - High valuations for items 4 and 3.
   - Allocate item 4.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - High valuations for items 3 and 4, but item 4 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 3.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Remaining items are 1 and 5.
   - Allocate items 1 and 5.

This allocation is done by considering agents' highest preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
