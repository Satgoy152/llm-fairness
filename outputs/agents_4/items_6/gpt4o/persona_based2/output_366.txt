Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  38  60  49  73  66
1   1  90  80  39  12  42
2  60  32  47   6  45   0
3  95  38  26  28  35  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 38 26 28 35 44]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider both efficiency and envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. This can be challenging given the constraints, but we can aim to minimize envy while ensuring each agent receives their best possible allocation given the circumstances.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly (84) and item 4 (73).
- Agent 1 values item 1 (90) and item 2 (80) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 0 (60) and item 2 (47).
- Agent 3 values item 0 (95) highly and item 5 (44).

A potential allocation strategy is to give each agent at least one highly-valued item and try to distribute the remaining items in a way that minimizes envy.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 3
- Agent 3: Items 0

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one of their higher-valued items while distributing the remaining items to balance out total values. Below is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and optimizes for high-value items based on their individual preferences.
