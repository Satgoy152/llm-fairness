Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  35  63  90  70  27
1  70  79  81  10  54  29
2  92  17  84  91  54  88
3  36  60  77  24  84  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 79 81 10 54 29]
 [92 17 84 91 54 88]
 [36 60 77 24 84 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations table, we need to consider the total value each agent places on the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Here's the valuation table for quick reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  35  63  90  70  27
1  70  79  81  10  54  29
2  92  17  84  91  54  88
3  36  60  77  24  84  94
```

By examining the table, we can attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items whose total valuation is approximately equal or as fair as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuation for items 0 and 3.
   - Allocate items 0 and 3.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuation for items 2 and 1.
   - Allocate items 2 and 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuation for item 5.
   - Allocate item 5.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - High valuation for item 4.
   - Allocate item 4.

This allocation strategy considers the highest preference items for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives items, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items they value highly, aiming for a fair division.
