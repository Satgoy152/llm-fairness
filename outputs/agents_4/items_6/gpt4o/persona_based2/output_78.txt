Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  17  83  36  86  77
1  49  17  21  18  59  59
2  70   8   9  24  42  59
3  68  75  82  80  31  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider both efficiency and envy-freeness. While a perfectly envy-free allocation might not always be possible, we can aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

Given the problem constraints and the valuations provided, let's approach this by ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their total value while minimizing potential envy. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 0 (99) and item 4 (86). Allocating these items to Agent 0 would maximize their total value.
2. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 1 (75) and 2 (82), and item 3 (80). Allocating these items to Agent 3 would provide them with a higher total value.
3. **Agent 1** and **Agent 2** have lower overall valuations, but we can ensure they receive the remaining items in a way that attempts to balance their total valuation compared to the others.

With these considerations, here is a potential allocation:

- Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent based on their preferences, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
