Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  94  44  90  13  35
1  16  14  84  22   5  77
2  57  98  53  90  35  19
3  71  68  52  36  29   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16 14 84 22  5 77]
 [57 98 53 90 35 19]
 [71 68 52 36 29  8]]
Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to ensure that each agent receives an allocation of items such that the total value they perceive is as fair as possible. A common criterion for such fairness is "envy-freeness," where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 29     | 94     | 44     | 90     | 13     | 35     |
| 1     | 16     | 14     | 84     | 22     | 5      | 77     |
| 2     | 57     | 98     | 53     | 90     | 35     | 19     |
| 3     | 71     | 68     | 52     | 36     | 29     | 8      |

We will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values Item 1 (94) and Item 3 (90). Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 2 (84) and Item 5 (77). Assign these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** should receive Item 0 (57), as it is one of the higher values left for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** can take Item 4 (29), which is relatively the highest remaining value for them.

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item they value highly, minimizing envy.

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 6 items while trying to minimize envy among agents by considering their highest valued items.
