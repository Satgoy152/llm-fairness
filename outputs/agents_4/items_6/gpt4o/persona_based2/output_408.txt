Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91   0   5  89  91  18
1  79  17  59  14  37  80
2  77  81  84  66  21  34
3  54  45  90  17  59  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming to achieve some level of envy-freeness, we can use a heuristic approach. The goal is to ensure each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations. One common method is to use the "maximin" approach, which attempts to maximize the minimum value any agent receives.

Let's analyze the given valuations and allocate items:

1. Look for high individual valuations:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0 (91), 3 (89), and 4 (91).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 (80) the most.
   - Agent 2 values items 1 (81) and 2 (84) the highest.
   - Agent 3 values item 2 (90) the most.

2. Assign items based on these priorities, trying to avoid conflicts and ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 3 (two of their highest-valued items).
- Agent 1: Assign item 5 (their highest-valued item).
- Agent 2: Assign items 1 and 2 (their two highest-valued items).
- Agent 3: Assign item 4.

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one of their most valued items, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
