Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  69  62   3  78  78
1  43  88  31  63  45   1
2  74  56   8  90  51  64
3  25  38  63  61  97  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [43 88 31 63 45  1]
 [74 56  8 90 51 64]
 [25 38 63 61 97 95]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers someone else's allocation to their own. Given the valuations provided in the table, we aim for an allocation where each agent receives a subset of items that they value highly, while ensuring that the distribution is as balanced as possible.

Let's compute the total value each agent assigns to the items:

1. Agent 0: [29, 69, 62, 3, 78, 78] = 319
2. Agent 1: [43, 88, 31, 63, 45, 1] = 271
3. Agent 2: [74, 56, 8, 90, 51, 64] = 343
4. Agent 3: [25, 38, 63, 61, 97, 95] = 379

Next, let's attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences:

1. **Allocate to Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values items 4 and 5. Assign these to Agent 3.
   - Agent 3 receives items [4, 5].
   - Remaining items: [0, 1, 2, 3].

2. **Allocate to Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 3. Assign this to Agent 2.
   - Agent 2 receives item [3].
   - Remaining items: [0, 1, 2].

3. **Allocate to Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 1. Assign this to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 receives item [1].
   - Remaining items: [0, 2].

4. **Allocate to Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 2. Assign these to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 receives items [0, 2].

Now, each agent has received items that they value highly, and all 6 items have been allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
