Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  86   1  13  87  24
1  24  36  55  34  32  18
2  20  19   1  12  89  68
3  42  66  53  95  64  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 86  1 13 87 24]
 [24 36 55 34 32 18]
 [20 19  1 12 89 68]
 [42 66 53 95 64 56]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of any other agent. Given the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  86   1  13  87  24
1  24  36  55  34  32  18
2  20  19   1  12  89  68
3  42  66  53  95  64  56
```

We'll analyze the valuations and try to find an allocation that minimizes envy or makes it as fair as possible. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1]: These are the highest valued items for Agent 0, with values 76 and 86. 
- Agent 1 gets items [2, 3]: While not the highest, these provide a reasonable total value given other constraints.
- Agent 2 gets item [4]: This is highly valued at 89 by Agent 2, which is the highest among their preferences.
- Agent 3 gets item [5]: This is the highest value left (56) and gives Agent 3 a fair share compared to others.

The allocations can be presented in the required JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent is receiving items that are among the more highly valued in their perspective, and although not perfect in terms of envy-freeness, it is fair given the constraints of integer allocation and limited items.
