Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  11  51   7  89  64
1  78   2  91  35  39  69
2  72  61   8  39  54  85
3  54  73  76  32  13  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. Given that there are 4 agents and 6 items, some agents will receive more than one item, and some may receive fewer.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has relatively high valuations for items 2 and 5. Allocating items that are most valuable to them will help ensure they feel their share is fair.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the most but since it is already allocated, we can give them item 5, which they also value highly.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 the most, but since it is already allocated, we can allocate item 0, which they also value highly.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 3. Allocating these items to them will ensure they feel their share is fair.

After considering these preferences, the allocations can be made as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [4], as they value item 4 highly.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [2], as it is their highest value item.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items [5], valuing it highly.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items [0, 1, 3], as these items collectively maximize their valuation.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value, reducing envy.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items with relatively high personal valuations.
