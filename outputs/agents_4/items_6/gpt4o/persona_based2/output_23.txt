Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  28  86  46   4  16
1  65  59  20  80  62  30
2  84  72  61  15   4  12
3  84  62  97   7  52  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 59 20 80 62 30]
 [84 72 61 15  4 12]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and aim for an envy-free division where each agent feels they received at least as much value as they perceive any other agent to have received. Given that we have 4 agents and 6 items, each agent should ideally receive at least 1 item, but since 6 cannot be evenly divided by 4, some agents will end up with two items, and others with one.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** Each agent will likely perceive an allocation as fair if they receive items that they highly value.

2. **Initial Assignment Based on Highest Valuation:** Start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item that has not yet been allocated to another agent.

3. **Resolve Conflicts and Adjust for Fairness:** If multiple agents value a single item the most, we can resolve this by considering their next highest-valued items or adjusting based on overall fairness.

4. **Complete the Allocation:** Ensure that each item is allocated and adjust assignments to balance the total perceived value.

Let's go through the table to assign items:

- **Agent 0:** Highest value is item 2 (value 86). Assign item 2.
- **Agent 1:** Highest value is item 3 (value 80). Assign item 3.
- **Agent 2:** Highest value is item 0 (value 84). Assign item 0.
- **Agent 3:** Highest value is item 2 (value 97), but it's already taken by Agent 0. The next highest is item 5 (value 93). Assign item 5.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 2, 3, and 5. Items 1 and 4 remain unallocated.

- **Agent 1:** Next highest value item is item 1 (value 59). Assign item 1.
- **Agent 3:** Next highest value item is item 4 (value 52). Assign item 4.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 1
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 5 and 4

This allocation considers both the highest valuations and ensures all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```
