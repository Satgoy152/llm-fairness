Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  72  47  59   2  58
1  95  51  31   7  41  82
2  78  68  18  74  94  84
3   8  82  46  64  31  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we can use a method known as the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or simply try to balance the total valuations each agent receives. Since we have four agents and six items, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels that they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 70 + 72 + 47 + 59 + 2 + 58 = 308
- Agent 1: 95 + 51 + 31 + 7 + 41 + 82 = 307
- Agent 2: 78 + 68 + 18 + 74 + 94 + 84 = 416
- Agent 3: 8 + 82 + 46 + 64 + 31 + 74 = 305

We want to distribute the items such that each agent receives items with a total value that feels fair to them. One potential method is to iteratively assign the items to the agent who values them the most until all items are distributed. However, we must ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Allocate item 1** to Agent 0, as they value it highest (72).
2. **Allocate item 0** to Agent 1, as they value it highest (95).
3. **Allocate item 4** to Agent 2, as they value it highest (94).
4. **Allocate item 5** to Agent 2, as they value it next highest (84).
5. **Allocate item 3** to Agent 3, as they value it highest (64).
6. **Allocate item 2** to Agent 0, to balance the distribution.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent has at least one item, and no agent feels significantly envious of another.
