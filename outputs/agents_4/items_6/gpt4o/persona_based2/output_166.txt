Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  13  69  91  44   5
1  65  30  35   2  94  86
2  83  45   0  74  24  20
3  95  17  63  13  77  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 30 35  2 94 86]
 [83 45  0 74 24 20]
 [95 17 63 13 77 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a manner that considers the valuations and attempts to achieve envy-freeness, we should examine the valuation matrix and look for an allocation where each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value, while ensuring that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

The valuation matrix is as follows:

```
    Item:  0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent:
0         99  13  69  91  44   5
1         65  30  35   2  94  86
2         83  45   0  74  24  20
3         95  17  63  13  77  42
```

Here's one potential fair allocation considering each agent's valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0. Thus, allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4. Thus, allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 3. Thus, allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2. Thus, allocate item 2 to agent 3.

Now, for the remaining items:

- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 2 after their highest choice, so it can be allocated to agent 2.
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 1 after their highest choice, so it can be allocated to agent 1.

This distribution gives us:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [4, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 1]
- Agent 3: [2]

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
