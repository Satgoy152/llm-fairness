Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  83  53  91  94  98
1  73  23  17  73  80  57
2  70  49  87  46  66  54
3  91  93   1  15  28  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 83 53 91 94 98]
 [73 23 17 73 80 57]
 [70 49 87 46 66 54]
 [91 93  1 15 28 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider an allocation that tries to minimize envy and maximize fairness based on the given valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation, given the constraints.

We start by considering the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 71 + 83 + 53 + 91 + 94 + 98 = 490
- Agent 1: 73 + 23 + 17 + 73 + 80 + 57 = 323
- Agent 2: 70 + 49 + 87 + 46 + 66 + 54 = 372
- Agent 3: 91 + 93 + 1 + 15 + 28 + 25 = 253

Based on these totals, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share. A naive approach is to start by assigning each agent their most valued item, but we need to ensure that every agent's allocation is as balanced as possible considering their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest total valuation. We aim to satisfy them with high-value items to prevent envy.
2. **Agent 3** has low valuation for most items except for two, which they value highly, so we should give them those items.
3. **Agent 1** and **Agent 2** have moderate valuations across the items, so we attempt to distribute the remaining items in a way that balances their satisfaction.

Given these considerations, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 5 (value 98), 4 (value 94)
- **Agent 1**: Items 3 (value 73), 0 (value 73)
- **Agent 2**: Items 2 (value 87)
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value 93)

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total item value.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair portion based on their valuation.
