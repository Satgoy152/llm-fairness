Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  72  55  64  13  61
1  59  93  12  60  99  66
2  91  20  14  43   3  40
3  26  79  41  33  48   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve a fair division, possibly focusing on envy-freeness. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum value or ensuring that each agent receives a bundle that they value at least as much as possible given the constraints.

To start, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 0 highly, but also item 3.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 1.

A possible allocation strategy to minimize envy could be:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (91).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 3, since it has the highest value for them (79).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their most valued item (99).
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it gives them a decent value (61) and no other agent values it particularly highly.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it more (43) compared to others.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they have a decent valuation for it (55).

Given these assignments, each agent receives at least one item, and they are likely to be as satisfied as possible given their valuations.

Here's the fair allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
