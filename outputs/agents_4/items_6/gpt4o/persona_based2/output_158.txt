Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  45  58  88  59  25
1   6  31  70  84  64  91
2  64  88  63  79  99  87
3  66  94  38  51  70  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents in such a way that the allocation is fair and each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. 

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 and 3 highly (88 each), so we can allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values items 5 highly (91), so we can allocate this to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 highly (99), so we can allocate this to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 highly (94), so we can allocate this to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2 is left. Its highest valuation is by Agent 1 (70), so we can allocate this to Agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [1]

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated, and each agent receives items that are among their top preferences, improving the likelihood of envy-freeness.
