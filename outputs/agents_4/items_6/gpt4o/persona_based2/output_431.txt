Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  34  31  51  98  68
1  37  19  40  30  29  91
2  48  16  21  67  77  33
3  65  39  13  91  23  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37 19 40 30 29 91]

 [65 39 13 91 23 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we need to find a division such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we'll use a method to distribute the items in a way that attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the most, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the most, so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the most, so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the most, so we allocate item 0 to agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 2:

5. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest valuation among unallocated items for agent 3.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 3.

6. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest remaining valuation among unallocated items for agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 2 with a total value of 98 + 31 = 129.
- Agent 1 receives item 5 with a total value of 91.
- Agent 2 receives item 3 with a total value of 67.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 1 with a total value of 65 + 39 = 104.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
