Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  23  16   1  47  60
1  79   2  65  39  69  68
2  42  14  10  70  90  49
3  89  83  30  88  87  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where no agent envies another. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as that of any other agent, based on their own valuation of the items. Given the constraints, we will attempt to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 0 and 5 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest, followed by items 4 and 5.
- Agent 2 values items 3 and 4 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest, followed by items 0 and 3.

Given these preferences, let's aim for a distribution where each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items:

1. **Agent 0**: Given agent 0 values item 5 highly and it's a top choice among others, let's allocate item 5 to agent 0. Additionally, item 1 can be given to agent 0 since it has relatively low valuation by others and gives agent 0 two items.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest. Let's allocate item 0 to agent 1. To ensure they have more than one item, item 2, which is moderately valued by agent 1 and less by others, can also be allocated to them.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 very highly. Let's allocate item 4 to agent 2. This allocation provides agent 2 with their highest valued item.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 highly. Let's allocate item 3 to agent 3. This gives them one of their highest valued items.

Here's the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocations are made with an aim to reduce envy by giving each agent one of their top preferences where possible.
