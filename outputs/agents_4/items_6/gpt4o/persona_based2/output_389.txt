Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  27  22  26  22   7
1  12  52  71   4   1  70
2  95  98  77  43  13  19
3  66  93  83  90  27  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 27 22 26 22  7]
 [12 52 71  4  1 70]
 [95 98 77 43 13 19]
 [66 93 83 90 27 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free or as close to envy-free allocation as possible. An envy-free allocation implies that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own.

Here's the breakdown of the valuations by agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [25, 27, 22, 26, 22, 7]
- Agent 1: [12, 52, 71, 4, 1, 70]
- Agent 2: [95, 98, 77, 43, 13, 19]
- Agent 3: [66, 93, 83, 90, 27, 93]

To allocate the items, we will attempt to give each agent items they value highly, while also ensuring that the allocation is fair:

1. **Agent 2** values item 1 (98) the most. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 3** values item 3 (90) the most. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 1** values item 2 (71) the most. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** values item 0 (25) the most among the remaining items. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 3** values item 5 (93) the next highest. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 2** values item 4 (13) the next highest among the remaining. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

With this allocation, we attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations, while each agent gets at least one item, maintaining fairness.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
