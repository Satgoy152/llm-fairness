Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  35  71  16  35  86
1  90  56  40  25  86  25
2  18  48   2  48  93  73
3  52   5  64  27  52  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy among the agents and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.

One approach is to use the "Envy-Free" algorithm, which attempts to allocate items so that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent to their own. However, for simplicity, we will use a heuristic approach here due to the limited number of items and agents.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0: [55, 35, 71, 16, 35, 86]
- Agent 1: [90, 56, 40, 25, 86, 25]
- Agent 2: [18, 48, 2, 48, 93, 73]
- Agent 3: [52, 5, 64, 27, 52, 89]

A simple way to allocate the items fairly is to give each agent the item they value the most, if possible, and then adjust from there to ensure each item is allocated:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most (86).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (90).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most (93).
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most (89), but since it's already assigned to Agent 0, Agent 3 will receive their next preferred item, which is item 2 (64).

Now the allocation looks like this:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [2]

We have allocated 4 out of 6 items. The remaining items are 1 and 3. We will distribute them to balance the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 1, as it's their second-highest valued remaining item.
- Agent 1 receives item 3, as it's their next highest valued remaining item.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each agent some of their most valued items, ensuring that all items are distributed.
