Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  11  48  96  19  14
1  10  35  51  12  38  62
2  93  83  51  83  61   2
3  84  23  77  79  13  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 11 48 96 19 14]
 [10 35 51 12 38 62]
 [93 83 51 83 61  2]
 [84 23 77 79 13 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. One such approach is to use the "maximum marginal utility" approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. However, since each agent must receive an integer number of items and there are only 6 items, we need to ensure that allocations are balanced.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [32, 11, 48, 96, 19, 14]
- Agent 1: [10, 35, 51, 12, 38, 62]
- Agent 2: [93, 83, 51, 83, 61, 2]
- Agent 3: [84, 23, 77, 79, 13, 67]

To start, we assign each item to the agent who values it most. This might need adjustment to ensure each agent gets at least one item or that allocations appear more balanced:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 93.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 83.
3. Item 2: Agent 3 values it at 77.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 96.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 38.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 62.

Now, we need to ensure that the distribution of items is more balanced:

- Agent 0: 1 item (3)
- Agent 1: 2 items (4, 5)
- Agent 2: 2 items (0, 1)
- Agent 3: 1 item (2)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and attempts to balance total value received:

Here's the final allocation presented in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints of integer allocation and aims to minimize envy given the valuation table.
