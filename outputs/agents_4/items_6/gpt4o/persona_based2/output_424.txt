Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  64  10  60  47  51
1   9  71   8  71  53  50
2  32  34  63  88  21   8
3  20  44  18  28  86  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. This can be challenging given the different valuations each agent has for the items. Let's use the concept of maximizing overall satisfaction or minimizing envy.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly. Let's allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values items 1 and 3 equally and highly. Let's allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest. Since item 1 is allocated to agent 1, let's allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest. Let's allocate item 4 to agent 3.

Now we have two items left, item 2 and item 5. Let's allocate them as follows:

5. Agent 2 values item 2 highly. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
6. Agent 0 values item 5 reasonably high. Allocate item 5 to agent 0.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items that they value the most given the constraints of the other agents' valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
