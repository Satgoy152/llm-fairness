Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  82  97  46  82  18
1  20  83  89  77  11  55
2  49  58  48  72  20  32
3  13  30  53  76  55  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation or as close as possible given the discrete nature of the problem. An envy-free allocation means each agent prefers their allocation over any other agent's allocation based on their individual valuations.

Let's examine the valuations and proceed with a heuristic method to allocate the items:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  82  97  46  82  18
1  20  83  89  77  11  55
2  49  58  48  72  20  32
3  13  30  53  76  55  43
```

We will follow these steps:
1. Assign items to agents in a manner that maximizes each agent's satisfaction.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item by examining the remaining unallocated items.

Start by allocating the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (97).
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 as well (89), but since agent 0 has a higher value for it, let's consider the next best for agent 1, which is item 1 (83).
- Agent 2 highly values item 3 (72).
- Agent 3 highly values item 3 as well (76), but since agent 2 has a lower value, let's consider the next best for agent 3, which is item 4 (55).

Now let's assign these items and determine the remaining:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.

Remaining items: 0, 5.

Let's allocate the remaining items by considering the next best preference for each agent who has not yet received their highest value items:

- Agent 0's next highest value is item 1, but it's already taken, so item 0 is next (71).
- Agent 1 has already received item 1.
- Agent 2 has already received item 3.
- Agent 3 already has item 4, so the next best is item 5 (43).

Now we allocate:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 3 receives item 5.

Thus, each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.
