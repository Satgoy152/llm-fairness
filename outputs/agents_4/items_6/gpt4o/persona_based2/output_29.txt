Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  62  69   1  16  23
1  65  44  80  26  76  89
2  97  60  20  16  21  89
3  37  32  60  60  78  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over others, or at least not be envious of any other agent's allocation.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:** For each item, identify which agent values it the most. This will help in determining the initial allocations.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated equals six and that each agent receives an integer number of items.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Review the allocations to ensure that no agent is significantly envious of another. If necessary, adjust the allocation to balance the envy-freeness.

Let's proceed with these steps:

- **Item 0:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (97).
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (62).
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (80).
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (26).
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (76).
- **Item 5:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (89).

The initial allocation based on highest valuations heavily favors Agent 1, which may lead to envious situations. We need to redistribute some items to achieve a fairer distribution.

**Revised Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Items 1 and 3 (Valuations: 62, 1)
- **Agent 1:** Items 2 and 4 (Valuations: 80, 76)
- **Agent 2:** Items 0 and 5 (Valuations: 97, 89)
- **Agent 3:** No items

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations. Agent 3 does not receive any items, but the envy between Agents 0, 1, and 2 is minimized.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": []
}
```
