Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  17  67  17  43  81
1  51  75  11  39  89  99
2  84  44  46  11   7  36
3  55   7  12  12  22  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 17 67 17 43 81]
 [51 75 11 39 89 99]
 [84 44 46 11  7 36]
 [55  7 12 12 22 49]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will employ a method to ensure that each agent receives items in a manner that minimizes envy. One common approach is to use the "round-robin" or "serial dictatorship" method, assigning items based on the highest valuation, but ensuring that agents receive an equal number of items overall whenever possible.

Let's begin the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations:**
   - Item 0: Value 83
   - Item 5: Value 81

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations:**
   - Item 5: Value 99
   - Item 4: Value 89

3. **Agent 2's highest valuations:**
   - Item 0: Value 84
   - Item 2: Value 46

4. **Agent 3's highest valuations:**
   - Item 5: Value 49 (after higher-value items are allocated)
   - Item 0: Value 55

To ensure fairness and minimize envy, we'll try to allocate each agent two items. This means that agents may not get their top choices if those items are in high demand by others. Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Allocation Process:
1. **Allocate Item 0** to Agent 2 (highest value: 84)
2. **Allocate Item 5** to Agent 1 (highest value: 99)
3. **Allocate Item 1** to Agent 1 (second-highest value among remaining: 75)
4. **Allocate Item 2** to Agent 0 (high value among remaining: 67)
5. **Allocate Item 3** to Agent 0 (next available item for Agent 0)
6. **Allocate Item 4** to Agent 3 (Agent 3 receives remaining item)

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [0]
- Agent 3: Items [4]

In this allocation:
- Each agent gets at least one item.
- The items are distributed in a way that respects the agents' valuations.

Now, let's present this in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
