Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  50  74  53  15   8
1  80  62  23  43  95  38
2  15  77  86  76  39  65
3  12  12  11  72  21  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. This means that each agent should feel they receive a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. One approach to achieve this is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, ensuring no one feels disadvantaged.

Given the valuations, let's attempt to allocate the items such that envy is minimized:

1. **Agent 0's highest values are for items 1 and 2.**
2. **Agent 1's highest values are for items 0 and 4.**
3. **Agent 2's highest values are for items 2 and 3.**
4. **Agent 3's highest values are for items 3 and 5.**

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy based on highest individual valuations:

- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 50)
- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 80)
- Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 86)
- Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 72)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 4 and 5:

- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 95)
- Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 81)

This allocation gives each agent at least one of their highest valued items, and every item is allocated. Let's verify:

- Agent 0: [1] (value 50)
- Agent 1: [0, 4] (values 80, 95)
- Agent 2: [2] (value 86)
- Agent 3: [3, 5] (values 72, 81)

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
