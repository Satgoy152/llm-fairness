Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  88  84  59  88  94
1  97  65  40  23  65  37
2  26  27  99  85  67  91
3  78  36  43  71  21  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[69 88 84 59 88 94]
 [97 65 40 23 65 37]
 [26 27 99 85 67 91]
 [78 36 43 71 21 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations in the table, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

We can start by calculating each agent's total valuation for all items and then attempt to allocate items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is balanced as equally as possible.

Let's examine the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 69 + 88 + 84 + 59 + 88 + 94 = 482
- Agent 1: 97 + 65 + 40 + 23 + 65 + 37 = 327
- Agent 2: 26 + 27 + 99 + 85 + 67 + 91 = 395
- Agent 3: 78 + 36 + 43 + 71 + 21 + 64 = 313

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign high-value items to agents who value them most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Try to balance the total valuation for each agent.

Based on the table and attempting to balance valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (94) and item 1 (88).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (97).
- Agent 2 highly values item 2 (99) and item 3 (85).
- Agent 3 highly values item 3 (71) and item 0 (78).

Given these preferences, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Items [2]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4]

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences and ensures that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
