Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  33  34  86  51  79
1  55  33  13  89   2  49
2  39  98  36  30  36  54
3  39  59  37   6   0  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[48 33 34 86 51 79]
 [55 33 13 89  2 49]
 [39 98 36 30 36 54]
 [39 59 37  6  0 51]]
Output:
To approach this problem, we aim to allocate the six items among the four agents in a way that is as fair as possible. One common method for fair division is to try to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. 

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [48, 33, 34, 86, 51, 79]
Agent 1: [55, 33, 13, 89, 2, 49]
Agent 2: [39, 98, 36, 30, 36, 54]
Agent 3: [39, 59, 37, 6, 0, 51]
```

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (86).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (89).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most (98).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (59).

2. **Assign high-value items**:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 because it's the highest value (98) across all agents for any item.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since they have a high valuation (89) and Agent 0 also values it highly, so this reduces potential envy.

3. **Continue with remaining items**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it's their second-highest value item (48).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it is also valued relatively high (79).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3 because it's one of their highest value items (37).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it fits well with their remaining preferences.

4. **Check allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 5
   - Agent 1: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Item 1
   - Agent 3: Item 2

These allocations aim to minimize envy by giving each agent items they value highly while ensuring that each item is allocated once.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and aims to achieve a fair division based on the valuations given.
