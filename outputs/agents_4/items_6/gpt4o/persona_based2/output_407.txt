Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  92  29  90  73  73
1   5  37  70  31  28  20
2   0   1  25  75   9  95
3  91  64  11  85  46  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1 92 29 90 73 73]
 [ 5 37 70 31 28 20]
 [ 0  1 25 75  9 95]
 [91 64 11 85 46 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. We focus on ensuring that no agent feels that another agent received a significantly better allocation compared to their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [1, 92, 29, 90, 73, 73]
Agent 1: [5, 37, 70, 31, 28, 20]
Agent 2: [0, 1, 25, 75, 9, 95]
Agent 3: [91, 64, 11, 85, 46, 53]
```

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we consider the preferences of each agent and attempt to allocate items so that each agent is satisfied with their share relative to others:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the most (92) and item 3 the second most (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the most (70).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the most (95).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the most (91).

We should start by allocating each agent their highest-valued item, if it doesn't conflict with othersâ€™ significant interests, and then distribute remaining items taking into account the next most valued items for each agent.

### Allocation Proposal
- **Agent 0**: (Item with the highest value) Item 1
- **Agent 1**: (Item with the highest value) Item 2
- **Agent 2**: (Item with the highest value) Item 5
- **Agent 3**: (Item with the highest value) Item 0

This leaves items 3 and 4 unallocated. We allocate them based on the next highest values:
- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (next highest valued item from the remaining)
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (next highest valued item from the remaining)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item they value highly, reducing potential envy.

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives a set of items, and the total number of items allocated is 6, satisfying the condition given.
