Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  82   2  14  72  85
1  54  26   0  23  44  37
2  42  40  92  31  65  23
3  56   0  55  70   4  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 82  2 14 72 85]
 [54 26  0 23 44 37]
 [42 40 92 31 65 23]
 [56  0 55 70  4 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels they have received an allocation that is at least as valuable to them as what any other agent has received.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  82   2  14  72  85
1  54  26   0  23  44  37
2  42  40  92  31  65  23
3  56   0  55  70   4  42
```

We aim to allocate the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 5. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has relatively balanced valuations but the highest for item 0. Assign this item to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a very high valuation for item 2. Assign this item to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has relatively high valuations for items 3 and 4. Assign these items to Agent 3.

This allocation gives each agent a combination of items that maximizes their perceived value based on their own valuation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation uses all the items and distributes them such that each agent receives an allocation that is as valuable to them as possible given the constraints.
