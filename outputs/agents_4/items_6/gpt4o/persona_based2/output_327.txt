Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  32  79  48  86   4
1  76  25  42  61   3   4
2  98  71  93  48  29  17
3  68  10  71  58  63  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [76 25 42 61  3  4]
 [98 71 93 48 29 17]
 [68 10 71 58 63 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is challenging with discrete items but we can try to get as close as possible given the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 74     | 32     | 79     | 48     | 86     | 4      |
| 1     | 76     | 25     | 42     | 61     | 3      | 4      |
| 2     | 98     | 71     | 93     | 48     | 29     | 17     |
| 3     | 68     | 10     | 71     | 58     | 63     | 16     |

### Step 1: Assign high-value items

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (98) and item 2 (93). Assign these items to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest (86). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

### Step 2: Allocate remaining items

3. **Agent 1** has a relatively high value for item 3 (61), compared to other items. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest remaining valuation for item 5 (16), so assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 0** has a higher valuation for item 1 (32) than others who have not received two items yet. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2
- Agent 3: Item 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, reducing envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation respects the integer constraint and uses all 6 items, attempting to minimize envy among agents.
