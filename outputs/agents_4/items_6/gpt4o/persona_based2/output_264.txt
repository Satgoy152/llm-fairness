Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  52  34  58  51  60
1  36   4  60   2  27  48
2  89  81  14  68  17  85
3   0  24  44  49  92  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the goal of achieving an envy-free distribution as much as possible, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items**:
   - Agent 0: 34 + 52 + 34 + 58 + 51 + 60 = 289
   - Agent 1: 36 + 4 + 60 + 2 + 27 + 48 = 177
   - Agent 2: 89 + 81 + 14 + 68 + 17 + 85 = 354
   - Agent 3: 0 + 24 + 44 + 49 + 92 + 95 = 304

2. **Prioritize allocation based on high valuations and attempt to balance total value received**:
   - Assign items to agents where they have relatively high valuations compared to others, while balancing the total value distributed.

3. **Allocate the items**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly, so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 highly, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 highly, so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 5 highly, so allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 0 also values item 1 highly compared to others, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 relatively more than others, so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation based on the above considerations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly, balancing the total value fairly across the agents.
