Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  12  12  61  51  12
1  34  76  18   0  19  60
2  71  39  67   7  64  29
3  98  35  52  40  59  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[24 12 12 61 51 12]
 [34 76 18  0 19 60]
 [71 39 67  7 64 29]
 [98 35 52 40 59 98]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent receives an integer number of items, we can consider the concept of envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 24, 12, 12, 61, 51, 12
Agent 1: 34, 76, 18, 0, 19, 60
Agent 2: 71, 39, 67, 7, 64, 29
Agent 3: 98, 35, 52, 40, 59, 98
```

We will aim to allocate items such that envy is minimized. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0 and 5. Assigning these high-value items to Agent 3 may reduce their envy significantly.

2. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly, so we can assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 0** has a relatively high valuation for item 3 compared to the other agents, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 0** also values item 4 highly compared to others, so item 4 can be allocated to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0 has items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 has item 1.
- Agent 2 has item 2.
- Agent 3 has items 0 and 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items according to their preferences while minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
