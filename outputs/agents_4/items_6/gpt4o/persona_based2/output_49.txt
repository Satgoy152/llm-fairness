Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  31  75  28   3  95
1  40  40  99  96  13  95
2  58  87  71  55  88  85
3  72  62  28  12  72  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a distribution that minimizes envy and respects each agent's valuations as closely as possible. A common approach is to look for an envy-free allocation, or at least a minimization of envy. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this problem:

1. **Assign the item with the highest value to each agent:** Start by assigning the item that each agent values the most. This might not result in a final allocation but serves as a sensible starting point.

2. **Iterate for fairness:** Adjust the allocation iteratively to ensure each agent is as satisfied as possible under the constraints of integer allocations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- **Agent 0** values item 5 the most (95).
- **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (99).
- **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (88).
- **Agent 3** values item 0 the most (72).

Using the initial assignment based on highest valuations:

- **Assign item 5 to Agent 0.**
- **Assign item 2 to Agent 1.**
- **Assign item 4 to Agent 2.**
- **Assign item 0 to Agent 3.**

Now, we assign the remaining items (1, 3) in a way that attempts to balance the overall valuations:

- **Agent 1** already has a high valuation item (99), but item 3 is also valued highly by Agent 1 (96). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 1 (87) highly after item 4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Thus, the items are allocated as follows:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [2, 3]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]
- Agent 3: [0]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item while aiming to minimize envy based on their valuation preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
