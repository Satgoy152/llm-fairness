Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  35  90  57  86  32
1  38  28  18  15  95  92
2  58  43  50  19  80  28
3  38  51  12  35  87  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that the division is as envy-free as possible given the constraints and that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will use the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum satisfaction or valuation to try and achieve fairness.

Here's one possible approach to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 90, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 95, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 58, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest, but it is already allocated, so we consider the next highest value, which is item 5 at 86, and allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now we have allocated items 0, 2, 4, and 5. We need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 3.

5. Agent 0's next highest non-allocated item is item 4 at 86, but it is already assigned. For item 1, Agent 0 values it at 35, which is higher than other agents for this item. Therefore, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
6. Item 3 is left. Agent 0 values item 3 at 57, Agent 1 at 15, Agent 2 at 19, and Agent 3 at 35. Agent 0 has the highest preference for item 3 among the unallocated items and agents. Thus, allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

This approach attempts to maximize the valuations each agent receives given the constraints.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation strives to be fair by considering the highest remaining valuations for each agent while ensuring that all 6 items are allocated.
