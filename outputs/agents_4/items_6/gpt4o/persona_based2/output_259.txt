Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  87  60  35  28  62
1  83  90  72  73  13  44
2  69  96   9  94  23  58
3  14  80  69   9  57  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[30 87 60 35 28 62]
 [83 90 72 73 13 44]
 [69 96  9 94 23 58]
 [14 80 69  9 57 94]]
Output:
In order to allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the agents' valuations, a potential solution is to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents by assigning items to agents in a way that considers their preferences and valuations.

Let's consider the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: 30, 87, 60, 35, 28, 62
Agent 1: 83, 90, 72, 73, 13, 44
Agent 2: 69, 96, 9, 94, 23, 58
Agent 3: 14, 80, 69, 9, 57, 94
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to consider different combinations and ensure that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation relative to what others receive. Upon analyzing the valuations, one possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives items 3.
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 4.

This allocation is based on the principle of maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their own allocation compared to others. Now let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items according to their preferences and the total number of items allocated is exactly six.
