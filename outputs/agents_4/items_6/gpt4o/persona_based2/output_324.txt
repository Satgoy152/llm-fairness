Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  91   0  21  62  26
1  58  90  12   5  35  47
2  18  37  78  87  88  40
3  23  11  42  21   9  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 91  0 21 62 26]
 [58 90 12  5 35 47]
 [18 37 78 87 88 40]
 [23 11 42 21  9 68]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. This can be challenging given the specific valuations, but it's key to find a distribution that maximizes individual satisfaction based on their specific preferences.

### Valuation Table Recap:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  91   0  21  62  26
1  58  90  12   5  35  47
2  18  37  78  87  88  40
3  23  11  42  21   9  68
```

### Strategy:
1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:** Allocate items with high valuation scores to the respective agents to minimize envy.
2. **Balance Allocation:** Ensure each agent receives a similar number of items to maintain balance.
3. **Consider Total Allocation:** Ensure that exactly 6 items are allocated.

### Allocation Process:
- Agent 0 highly values item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values items 2, 3, and 4 highly. Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

### Final Check:
- Ensure each agent is not envious of another's allocation based on their preferences.
- Verify the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.

### Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the high-value preferences of each agent, distributing the items in a manner that minimizes envy.
