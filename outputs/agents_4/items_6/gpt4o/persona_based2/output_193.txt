Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  86  62  90  64  22
1   3  16  14  13  16  13
2  84  25  19  68  40  26
3  43  49  71  10  74  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure a fair distribution based on their valuations. One common approach is to use the "maximin" or "envy-free up to one item" allocation, where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, and no agent feels significantly envious of another after potentially removing one item from the other's bundle.

We need to consider the distribution of items such that each agent's relative satisfaction is optimized, given their valuation of the items. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Determine which items are most valued by each agent and attempt to allocate those to them.
  
2. **Allocate Items Based on Preference and Fairness**: Distribute items to balance between maximizing individual satisfaction and minimizing overall envy among agents.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: Ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation to the point where they would prefer another's bundle, potentially adjusted by removing an item.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** highly values items 1 (86) and 3 (90).
- **Agent 1** has relatively low valuations across all items but values item 4 (16) and item 1 (16) the most.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (84) and also values item 3 (68).
- **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (74) and item 2 (71).

Considering this information, we can allocate as follows:

- Assign items 1 and 3 to **Agent 0** since these are their highest-valued items.
- Assign item 4 to **Agent 3**, as it's their highest-valued item, and then item 2, also highly valued.
- Assign item 0 to **Agent 2**, which is their most valued item.
- Assign item 5 to **Agent 1**, as it is the remaining item and has relatively similar valuations across agents, but is not specifically highly valued by any.

This distribution attempts to meet fairness by aligning the most valued items with the agents that value them most, while also ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
