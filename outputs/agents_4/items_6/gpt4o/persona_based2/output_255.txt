Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  33  19  85  53  96
1  27  12  25  34  76  43
2  38  58  26   3  59  81
3  15  66  60  33  71  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. The goal is to minimize any potential envy an agent might have towards others' allocations. 

Let's evaluate the situation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 5 the highest at 96, followed by item 3 at 85.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the highest at 76.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the highest at 81, followed by item 4 at 59.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 the highest at 71, followed by item 1 at 66.

To assign the items in a manner that is as envy-free as possible, we can proceed as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 5 (96) and item 3 (85), as these are the highest valued items for this agent.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 (76), which is the highest valued item for this agent.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 0 (38) and item 1 (58). While these are not the highest value items for Agent 2, they are unclaimed by others and provide a reasonable value.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 2 (60) and item 1 (66) since item 1 is highly valued by this agent.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are relatively high in their own valuation, minimizing envy. The items are distributed such that no agent receives more items than others, which could be perceived as unfair.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all six items are allocated.
