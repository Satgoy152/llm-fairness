Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7   6  18  98  92  24
1   8  98  17  89  35  61
2   4  99  73  68  29  31
3  91  74  75  73  31  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 98 17 89 35 61]
 [ 4 99 73 68 29 31]
 [91 74 75 73 31 21]]
Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents in such a way that the allocation is envy-free, as far as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible, we can aim to minimize envy.

One approach is to use the "adjusted winner" or "sequential allocation" method, considering each agent's valuations for the items. Let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 3 (value 98) and item 4 (value 92).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 1 (value 98) and item 3 (value 89).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 1 (value 99) and item 2 (value 73).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 (value 91) and item 2 (value 75).

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuations first, trying to balance the allocations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest preference of 99).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest preference of 98).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest preference of 91).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (second-highest preference of 92).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (second-highest preference of 75).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest preference of 61).

This allocation minimizes envy as best as possible with the given constraints. 

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
