Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  88  59   5  87  73
1  39  54  39   8  75  12
2  55  88  35  82  41  81
3   8  96  66  83  66  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we use the concept of envy-freeness and fair division. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they received a fair share of the items based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

To do this, we can use an approach called the "round robin" method, where agents take turns selecting their most valued item that remains unallocated. This helps in minimizing envy since each agent is able to choose the best available item according to their personal valuation.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Looks at the highest valued items. The item with the highest value for agent 0 is item 1 (value 88). Agent 0 selects item 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Next, agent 1 selects the highest valued unallocated item, which is item 4 (value 75).
3. **Agent 2**: Looks for the highest valued item remaining, which is item 1 (value 88), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 5 (value 81). Agent 2 selects item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Selects item 1 (value 96), but itâ€™s already taken. Next highest is item 3 (value 83). Agent 3 selects item 3.

Now each agent has one item, and we continue the round-robin selection:

5. **Agent 0**: Remaining highest is item 0 (value 70). Agent 0 selects item 0.
6. **Agent 1**: Remaining highest is item 2 (value 39), since item 4 is already taken. Agent 1 selects item 2.

Now, all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation is envy-free under the assumption that each agent gets to pick their best available option in turn, and it ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items with no items left unallocated.
