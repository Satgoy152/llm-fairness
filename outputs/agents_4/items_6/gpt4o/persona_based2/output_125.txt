Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  27   9  81  83  98
1   5  89  22  91   9  94
2  92  60  30  24  66  57
3  36  13  78  70  75   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 60 30 24 66 57]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels that their share is at least as good as any other agent's share according to their valuations. Given the constraints of integer allocations and the need to allocate all items, achieving perfect envy-freeness might be challenging, but we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (98), followed by item 0 (91).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (91), followed by item 5 (94).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (92), followed by item 4 (66).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (78), followed by item 4 (75).

We'll aim to give each agent their highest-valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 98).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 91).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 92).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value 78).

Now, we have items 1 and 4 remaining to be allocated.

- Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 0 (83) and Agent 3 (75).
- Item 1 is valued by Agent 1 (89) and Agent 2 (60).

Assign item 4 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1 to balance the distribution while considering preferences.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.
- Agent 3 receives item 2.

These allocations attempt to respect the highest valuations and distribute all items.

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation tries to minimize envy by giving each agent some of their highest-valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.
