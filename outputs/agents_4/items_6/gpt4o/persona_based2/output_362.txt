Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  52  98  16  61  79
1  32  62  21  78  31  67
2  55  90  19  90  33  59
3  98  63   1   7  13  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 90 19 90 33 59]

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy among the agents. This involves considering the valuations of each agent for each item and trying to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction for each agent while keeping envy to a minimum.

### Steps for Fair Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highly (98).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 highly (78).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 and item 3 (90 each).
   - Agent 3 values item 0 highly (98).

2. **Allocate High-Value Items**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - With items 4 and 5 remaining, consider the agents who have received fewer items or could benefit more:
     - Agent 0 has received one high-value item (item 2).
     - Agent 1 has received one high-value item (item 3).
     - Agent 2 has received one high-value item (item 1).
     - Agent 3 has received one high-value item (item 0).

4. **Distribute Remaining Items to Maximize Satisfaction**:
   - Item 4:
     - Agent 0 values it at 61.
     - Agent 1 values it at 31.
     - Agent 2 values it at 33.
     - Agent 3 values it at 13.
     - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for this item).

   - Item 5:
     - Agent 0 values it at 79.
     - Agent 1 values it at 67.
     - Agent 2 values it at 59.
     - Agent 3 values it at 29.
     - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (highest value for this item).

### Final Allocations:

Based on the above reasoning, the final allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, thus minimizing envy. Agent 0 receives more items but they are of lower value to others, balancing out the overall allocation.
