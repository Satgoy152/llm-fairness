Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  77  41  11  62  12
1   6  46  26  65  34   3
2   2  35  30  84  19  37
3  45  27  89  86  56  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 77 41 11 62 12]
 [ 6 46 26 65 34  3]
 [ 2 35 30 84 19 37]
 [45 27 89 86 56 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we will aim to maximize each agent's valuation of their assigned items. The goal is to ensure that no agent prefers another's allocation to their own, based on their individual valuation table. We will use a simple heuristic approach to achieve a fair allocation.

Here is the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (77), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (65), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest as well (84), but since it is already allocated, we allocate item 5 to Agent 2, which is their next highest valued item (37).
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the highest (89), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have the following items still unallocated: 0, 4.

5. **Agent 0**: Considering remaining items, item 0 (27) is the highest unallocated value, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1**: Considering remaining items, item 4 (34) is the highest unallocated value, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, all items have been allocated. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2]
}
```
