Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76   0  20  17  45  36
1  69  30  60  79  44  51
2  72  71  84  71  53  36
3  81  19  11  94  37  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 71 84 71 53 36]
 [81 19 11 94 37 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, taking into account the concept of envy-freeness, we should assign items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This involves a strategic assignment based on the valuations provided.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (76).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (79).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (84).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (94), but since agent 3 values item 3 even higher than agent 1, it is a strong candidate for agent 3.

We need to allocate the items in such a way to balance these valuations. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as this has the highest value for Agent 0.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as this has the highest value for Agent 3.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as this has the highest value for Agent 2.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 also values item 1 highly, which is the second-highest for Agent 2.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as this has moderate value for Agent 1 and isn't highly valued by others compared to their highest values.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it provides a balance in allocation and is of moderate value to Agent 1.

This allocation considers each agent's top preferences and balances the allocation to ensure no agent has a clear preference for another agent's bundle over their own.

Therefore, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that reflects their individual valuations, maintaining a balance and striving for envy-freeness.
