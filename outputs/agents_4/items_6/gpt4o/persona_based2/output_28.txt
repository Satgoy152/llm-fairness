Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  26  87  41  66  81
1  31  11  57   7  27   8
2  89  34  84   4  71  66
3  87  70  86  60  51  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 26 87 41 66 81]
 [31 11 57  7 27  8]
 [89 34 84  4 71 66]
 [87 70 86 60 51 47]]
Output:
To solve this problem, we want to allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible. A common approach to achieve fairness is to minimize envy among agents, where an agent prefers their own allocation over any other agentâ€™s allocation.

Here are the valuations from the table:

```
Agent 0: [71, 26, 87, 41, 66, 81]
Agent 1: [31, 11, 57,  7, 27,  8]
Agent 2: [89, 34, 84,  4, 71, 66]
Agent 3: [87, 70, 86, 60, 51, 47]
```

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Highest Valuation Allocation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (Value 89)
   - Item 1: Agent 3 (Value 70)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (Value 87)
   - Item 3: Agent 3 (Value 60)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (Value 71)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (Value 81)

2. **Check for Envy-Freeness:**
   - Agent 0 has items [2, 5] with a total value of 168.
   - Agent 1 has no items.
   - Agent 2 has items [0, 4] with a total value of 160.
   - Agent 3 has items [1, 3] with a total value of 130.
   - Adjust to ensure no agent envies another.

3. **Adjust Allocations for Fairness:**
   - Since agent 1 has no items, we need to re-evaluate the allocation to ensure no agent is left without items.
   - Consider giving at least one item to each agent and redistributing to balance the total valuations.

4. **Redistribution:**
   - Move item 3 from Agent 3 to Agent 1 (to give Agent 1 a non-zero allocation).
   - Final allocations:
     - Agent 0: [2, 5]
     - Agent 1: [3]
     - Agent 2: [0, 4]
     - Agent 3: [1]

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and although Agent 1 has a smaller share, this approach reduces envy by attempting to balance out the total values received by each agent.
