Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  79  18  19  65  95
1  30  26  84  30  28  63
2  17  19  33  12  92  58
3  41  24  85  40   3  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that envy-freeness is maximized, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum utility or minimizing envy. Given the valuations of the items by each agent, we'll try to ensure that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, while also attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.

Firstly, let's summarize each agent's valuations for the items:

- Agent 0 values: [64, 79, 18, 19, 65, 95]
- Agent 1 values: [30, 26, 84, 30, 28, 63]
- Agent 2 values: [17, 19, 33, 12, 92, 58]
- Agent 3 values: [41, 24, 85, 40, 3, 53]

To ensure a fair distribution, we can start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, and then adjust to maintain balance. 

Here's a proposed allocation that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it the most at 95).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (Agent 3 values it the most at 85).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it the most at 92).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 64, which is the highest remaining value).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 79, which is the highest remaining value).
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 30, which is the highest remaining value among those not receiving the item yet).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item that they value highly, while also attempting to distribute the total values fairly. The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Total value = 64 + 79 + 95 = 238
- Agent 1: Total value = 30
- Agent 2: Total value = 92
- Agent 3: Total value = 85

This allocation aims to maximize the minimum satisfaction and minimize envy among agents, given the constraints of integer allocations.
