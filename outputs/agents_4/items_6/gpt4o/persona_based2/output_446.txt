Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  89  50  75  88  35
1  12  37  30  91  76  99
2  72  22  74  24  59  65
3  86  61   1  42  17  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 61  1 42 17 36]]
Output:
To solve the fair division problem while ensuring envy-freeness and allocating all items, we can use a round-robin allocation strategy based on the agents' preferences. Let's go through the preferences and allocate the items one by one.

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations: [16, 89, 50, 75, 88, 35]
   - Highest value: Item 1 (89)
   
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations: [12, 37, 30, 91, 76, 99]
   - Highest value: Item 5 (99)
   
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations: [72, 22, 74, 24, 59, 65]
   - Highest value: Item 2 (74)
   
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations: [86, 61, 1, 42, 17, 36]
   - Highest value: Item 0 (86)

At this point, each agent has received one item based on their highest valuation:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

5. **Remaining Items**: 3, 4
   - Next in line based on original order, Agent 0: Highest remaining value is Item 4 (88)
   - Next in line, Agent 1: Allocated Item 3 by default as it is the only one left.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 5, 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
