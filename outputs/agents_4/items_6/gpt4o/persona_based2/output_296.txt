Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  13  71   2  67  76
1  90  91  86  17  53  97
2  78  96  66  42  50  73
3  15  90  71   5  99  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of the items among the agents, I will consider maximizing each agent's utility while aiming to minimize envy. A common approach is to use the maximum envy-free allocation or the envy-graph procedure, but given the discrete nature of the problem, a heuristic approach will be used.

Here's a step-by-step outline of the allocation process:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: Look for items that have significantly higher valuations by one agent compared to others, as allocating these items to the respective agent reduces potential envy.

2. **Allocate Items**: Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations to maximize individual happiness.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: After the initial allocation, adjust allocations to minimize envy if possible.

### Initial High Valuation Allocations:

- **Agent 1** values item 5 highly (97), which is the highest valuation for that item.
- **Agent 3** values item 4 highly (99), the highest valuation for that item.
- **Agent 2** values item 1 highly (96), which is the highest for that item.
- **Agent 0** values item 2 highly (71), while Agents 1 and 3 also value it at the same level, but Agent 0 has fewer high-value items.

### Allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

### Remaining Items:

- Items 0 and 3 remain.

### Allocate Remaining Items:

- **Agent 1** values item 0 highly (90). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** has a reasonable valuation for item 3 (42), higher than the others. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation takes into account the highest valuations for specific items by agents and attempts to minimize envy by ensuring that agents receive items they value more highly than others do.
