Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  62  99  34  25  90
1  14  80  23  74  77  54
2  31  25  50  41  83  25
3  23  68  38  59  62  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility and trying to ensure envy-freeness to the extent possible. Let's evaluate the situation and consider possible allocations.

We have 4 agents and 6 items. Each agent needs to receive an integer number of items. Since there are 6 items in total, we can allocate 1 or 2 items to each agent to ensure all items are distributed.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent has for all items to get a sense of their preferences:

- Agent 0: 87 + 62 + 99 + 34 + 25 + 90 = 397
- Agent 1: 14 + 80 + 23 + 74 + 77 + 54 = 322
- Agent 2: 31 + 25 + 50 + 41 + 83 + 25 = 255
- Agent 3: 23 + 68 + 38 + 59 + 62 + 80 = 330

Now, we'll attempt to allocate the items to maximize each agent's utility while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and balancing the allocation as much as possible.

We will aim to give each agent at least one high-value item according to their preferences:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most: Assign item 2.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most: Assign item 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most: Assign item 4.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most: Assign item 5.

Now, we have allocated 4 out of 6 items. The remaining items are 0 and 3. We'll distribute these remaining items to further balance the allocation:

- **Agent 0** could also benefit from item 0 (87), which is their second-highest value.
- **Agent 1** can be given item 3 (74) to balance their allocation.

Thus, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: Item [5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, maximizing individual utilities and distributing items fairly based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
