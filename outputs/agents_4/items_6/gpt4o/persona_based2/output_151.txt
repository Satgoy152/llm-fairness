Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62   4  28  16  51  26
1  10  72  48  16  57  71
2  54  67  97  49  35  43
3  12  99  37  80  25  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 72 48 16 57 71]
 [54 67 97 49 35 43]
 [12 99 37 80 25 31]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Here's one possible allocation strategy considering the given valuations:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now we have two more items (4 and 5) to distribute to ensure each agent feels they have a fair share based on their valuations.

- Consider item 4: 
  - Agent 1 values it at 57, which is higher than the others. So, assign item 4 to Agent 1.

- Consider item 5:
  - Agent 1 values it at 71, but Agent 2 values it at 43.
  - To balance the allocation, assign item 5 to Agent 1 as it maximizes their total valuation without causing significant envy.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, minimizing envy among them.
