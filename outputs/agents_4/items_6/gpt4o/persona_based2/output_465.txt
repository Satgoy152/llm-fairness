Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  44   7  41  86  54
1  45  25  92  88  75  55
2  58  43  28   3  31  73
3  76  36  45  39  43  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 25 92 88 75 55]
 [58 43 28  3 31 73]
 [76 36 45 39 43 43]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness. A common approach is to use the "max-min" strategy, which attempts to maximize the minimum value each agent receives.

Let's compute each agent's total valuation for different possible allocations and try to find an allocation that is as fair as possible.

### Valuations Table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Total |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| 0     | 7      | 44     | 7      | 41     | 86     | 54     | 239   |
| 1     | 45     | 25     | 92     | 88     | 75     | 55     | 380   |
| 2     | 58     | 43     | 28     | 3      | 31     | 73     | 236   |
| 3     | 76     | 36     | 45     | 39     | 43     | 43     | 282   |

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 0**: This gives Agent 0 the highest single-item valuation (86).
2. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 1**: This gives Agent 1 the highest single-item valuation (92).
3. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 2**: This provides Agent 2 with a high-value item (73).
4. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 3**: This gives Agent 3 their highest single-item valuation (76).

Now, we have 2 remaining items (items 1 and 3). Let's continue:

5. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1**: This increases Agent 1's total significantly, using their second-highest preference for non-allocated items (88).
6. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: This gives Agent 0 their second-highest preference for non-allocated items (44).

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's total valuation.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuation while maintaining a fair distribution across all agents.
