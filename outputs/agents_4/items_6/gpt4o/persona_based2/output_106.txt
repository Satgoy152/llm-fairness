Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  39  48  90  48  53
1  65  69  11  89  26  68
2  26  93  99  91  89   1
3  70   2   5  83  91   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[66 39 48 90 48 53]
 [65 69 11 89 26 68]
 [26 93 99 91 89  1]
 [70  2  5 83 91  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels that their allocation is fair compared to others, based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [66, 39, 48, 90, 48, 53]
Agent 1: [65, 69, 11, 89, 26, 68]
Agent 2: [26, 93, 99, 91, 89, 1]
Agent 3: [70, 2, 5, 83, 91, 0]
```

We will use an approach to allocate items to agents based on maximizing each agentâ€™s total valuation while ensuring that no agent feels that another agent received a more valuable allocation from their perspective.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3, so assigning item 3 to Agent 0 is beneficial. 
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1, so assigning item 1 to Agent 1 is beneficial.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2, so assigning item 2 to Agent 2 is beneficial.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4, so assigning item 4 to Agent 3 is beneficial.

After assigning the items with the highest valuations, we allocate the remaining items to balance the total valuations:

5. **Remaining items**: 0 and 5.
   - Agent 1 can take item 5, as it has the next highest valuation for them.
   - Agent 0 can take item 0, as it has a reasonably high valuation for them compared to others.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: [3, 0]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [4]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest preferences while keeping the distribution fair and minimizing envy.
