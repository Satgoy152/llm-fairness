Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  98  92  52  90  77
1  93  81   3  16  54  99
2  90   0  80  47  43  43
3  32  59  28  94  83  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent values their bundle at least as much as the others, minimizing envy.

Here is an allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 1, and 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 but will not get it since Agent 0 values it more and can be compensated with other items.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 3.

Let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 1, as they have the highest value for these items.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5, which they value the most.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2. While they highly value item 0, Agent 0 values it more. Agent 2 can be compensated with item 2.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 3 and 4, as they have relatively high values for these items.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy each agent by giving them items they value highly, aiming to minimize potential envy among the agents.
