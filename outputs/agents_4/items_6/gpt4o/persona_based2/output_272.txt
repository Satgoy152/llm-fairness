Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  99  93   3  62  13
1   0  96   7  54  37  96
2  14  19  64  16  88   1
3  77  84  62  45  18  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 96  7 54 37 96]
 [14 19 64 16 88  1]
 [77 84 62 45 18 19]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll consider each agent's valuation of the items to distribute them in a way that is as envy-free as possible.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (99) and item 2 second most (93).
- Agent 1 values items 1 and 5 the most (96 each).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (88).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (77).

To achieve a fair distribution, we can assign items based on the highest valuations by each agent, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one approach:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is one of their highest valued items.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued item.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 3, as it is their highest valued item.
5. Now, we have items 2 and 3 left to allocate.

For the remaining items:
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (93).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it (54) more than the other agents.

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they highly value, reducing potential envy.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
