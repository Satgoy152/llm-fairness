Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  55  89  97  52  65
1   9  21  17  19  69  60
2  70  12  92   5  85   6
3  37  12  67  43  76  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents in a way that attempts to maximize fairness, possibly through maximizing total value for each agent or minimizing envy.

One approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm to allocate items based on their valuations. We'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  55  89  97  52  65
1   9  21  17  19  69  60
2  70  12  92   5  85   6
3  37  12  67  43  76  12
```

Let's assign the items:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 70).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 55).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 92).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 97).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 85).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 65).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 5
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 4
- Agent 3: No items

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, and 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agents 1 and 3 receive no items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 4],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
