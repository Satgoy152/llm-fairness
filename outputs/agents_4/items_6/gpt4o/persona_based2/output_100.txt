Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  86  50  43  49  79
1  17  64  22  37  88  14
2  60  52  90  73  33  50
3  99  82  13  74  94  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction and maintain envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations, we'll use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" approach as a guideline, which seeks to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the product of the agents' utilities. In practical terms, this often involves giving each agent at least one item they value highly.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [64, 86, 50, 43, 49, 79]
- Agent 1: [17, 64, 22, 37, 88, 14]
- Agent 2: [60, 52, 90, 73, 33, 50]
- Agent 3: [99, 82, 13, 74, 94, 15]

A reasonable allocation strategy would be to assign items in a way that each agent gets at least one highly valued item, thus reducing potential envy among agents. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 88, highest for Agent 1).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 73, second highest for Agent 2).
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 79, second highest for Agent 0).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 99, highest for Agent 3).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 86, highest for Agent 0).
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 90, highest for Agent 2).

Now, let's ensure that the allocation is complete and satisfies the condition of allocating all 6 items:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 5].
- Agent 1 receives item [4].
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 3].
- Agent 3 receives item [0].

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and no agent is left without an item. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation provides a distribution that aims to respect the agents' top preferences while considering fairness and envy-freeness principles.
