Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  48  87  99  86  20
1  41   1  42  27   0  89
2  37  91  42  36  34  29
3  32  25   2  72   4  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 48 87 99 86 20]
 [41  1 42 27  0 89]
 [37 91 42 36 34 29]
 [32 25  2 72  4 44]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should feel their allocation is at least as good as another's, based on their own valuations.

Let's first sum up the total valuations of items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 36 + 48 + 87 + 99 + 86 + 20 = 376
- Agent 1: 41 + 1 + 42 + 27 + 0 + 89 = 200
- Agent 2: 37 + 91 + 42 + 36 + 34 + 29 = 269
- Agent 3: 32 + 25 + 2 + 72 + 4 + 44 = 179

Now, let's try to allocate items such that each agent has a fair share considering their valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (99) and item 2 (87).
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 (89) the most.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 (91) the most.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 (72) and item 5 (44).

Given this, we try to assign each agent items that they value highly to minimize envy:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, since they value it 99, the highest among all agents.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3, as it balances the allocation and it is one of their higher-valued items compared to others.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining two items (2 and 4). Let's continue:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, since they value it significantly.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it adds to their allocation with a moderate value.

We have allocated all 6 items. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
