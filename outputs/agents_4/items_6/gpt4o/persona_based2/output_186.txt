Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  62  84  91  13  67
1  96  91  62  51  94  13
2  29  93  25  42   4  62
3   2  38  70  59  87  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering individual valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that any agent does not feel envious of another agent's allocation after potentially removing one item from the other agent's bundle.

Let's examine the valuations and try to distribute the items to meet this criterion:

### Valuations

```
Agent 0: [76, 62, 84, 91, 13, 67]
Agent 1: [96, 91, 62, 51, 94, 13]
Agent 2: [29, 93, 25, 42,  4, 62]
Agent 3: [ 2, 38, 70, 59, 87, 44]
```

### Initial Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: High preference for item 3 (value 91).
2. **Agent 1**: High preference for item 0 (value 96).
3. **Agent 2**: High preference for item 1 (value 93).
4. **Agent 3**: High preference for item 4 (value 87).

### Remaining Items

After assigning one high-value item to each agent based on their preferences, we have remaining items: 2, 5.

### Further Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Add item 2 (value 84), as it is next highest valued item for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Add item 5 (value 13), as it is the only remaining item.

### Final Allocation

This allocation should be envy-free up to one item:

- Agent 0: [3, 2]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [4]

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations in a way that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives at least one item, where possible, while respecting their top preferences.
