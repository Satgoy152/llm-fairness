Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36   1   4  25  15  85
1  57  27  31  24  42  84
2  60  17  84  47  36  51
3  91  38  81  17  78  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where no agent envies another agent's allocation. This involves maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here, the goal is to ensure fairness while considering the agents' valuations for each item:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: Highest value for item 5 (85)
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: Highest value for item 0 (57)
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: Highest value for item 2 (84)
4. **Agent 3's Valuations**: Highest value for item 0 (91)

To begin the allocation, we can use a greedy approach, assigning each agent their most valued item and then resolving conflicts:

1. **Item 5** can initially be allocated to Agent 0, as it's their highest value.
2. **Item 0** is highly valued by both Agents 1 and 3. Since Agent 3 values it more (91), it should go to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2** is assigned to Agent 2, as it's their highest value.
4. **Item 1** and **Item 3**: Since Agent 3 has already received item 0, we can allocate item 1 or item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 0, as Agent 0 is left with only one item so far.

Now, let's review the allocations to ensure all items are distributed and each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents with consideration for the highest value items for each agent, aiming for reduced envy and fairness.
