Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  74  58  61  60   1
1  59  19  13  33  96  39
2  99  89  77  89  91   4
3  92  71  37  24  22  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent should be at least as happy with their allocation as they would be with anyone else's allocation, given their own valuations.

Let's examine the distribution:

1. Compute the total valuation of each agent for all items.
2. Try to allocate items one by one, considering each agent's valuation to ensure a fair distribution.

Valuations:

- Agent 0: [31, 74, 58, 61, 60, 1]
- Agent 1: [59, 19, 13, 33, 96, 39]
- Agent 2: [99, 89, 77, 89, 91, 4]
- Agent 3: [92, 71, 37, 24, 22, 35]

Total valuations:

- Agent 0: 285
- Agent 1: 259
- Agent 2: 449
- Agent 3: 281

Given that there are 6 items and 4 agents, one approach to minimize envy is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuation that hasn't already been allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation 77).
2. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation 96).
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation 74).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (highest valuation 92).
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation 89).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation 39).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation remains balanced with respect to their valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items for which they have relatively high valuations.
