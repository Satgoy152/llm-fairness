Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  87  50   0  49  41
1  87  93  28  64   3  34
2  69  76  58  92  94  26
3   9  50  81   3  66  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 93 28 64  3 34]

 [ 9 50 81  3 66 94]]
Output:
To tackle this fair division problem, we need to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation (if possible). We can approach this by trying to balance the valuations each agent receives from their allocated items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 0 and 1. Assigning these items to Agent 0 maximizes their total valuation from the items they receive.  
   
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a high valuation for item 1, but since it's already allocated to Agent 0, we should consider the next best options. Items 3 and 5 offer a combined decent valuation for this agent.
   
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values items 3 and 4 highly, but since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, we assign item 4 to Agent 2. Item 2 can also be allocated to Agent 2 to increase their total valuation.
   
4. **Agent 3**: This agent places high value on item 5, but since item 5 is already allocated to Agent 1, we assign item 2 to Agent 3 to maximize their utility.

Now let's allocate the items based on the above strategy:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 5
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 2

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations received by each agent, given their preferences, and ensures that all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
