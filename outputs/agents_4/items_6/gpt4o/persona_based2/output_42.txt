Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  78  86  28  26  45
1  25  30  24  43  77  12
2  98   0  91  51  63  86
3  79   2  53  45  26  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and aim for a distribution that minimizes envy, ensuring an as fair as possible division. Given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all 6 items must be allocated, we'll use a heuristic approach to achieve this.

First, we will consider a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We can start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that the overall distribution remains balanced.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:** [62, 78, 86, 28, 26, 45]
2. **Agent 1's valuations:** [25, 30, 24, 43, 77, 12]
3. **Agent 2's valuations:** [98, 0, 91, 51, 63, 86]
4. **Agent 3's valuations:** [79, 2, 53, 45, 26, 98]

Next, let's allocate items to the agents based on their individual highest valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it most (98).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it most (78).
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it most (86).
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it most (43).
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it most (77).
- **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it most (98).

Now, let's list out the allocations:

- Agent 0: [1, 2]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [5]

This allocation considers each agent's strongest preferences and ensures that all 6 items are distributed. The allocations aim to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one of their high-value items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5]
}
```
