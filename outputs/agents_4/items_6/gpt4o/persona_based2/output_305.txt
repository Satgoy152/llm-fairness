Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  96   9  59  96   1
1  74  43  19   5   1  67
2  30  10  23  78  13  88
3  96  71  10  43   7  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to ensure that each agent receives items in a manner that strives for envy-freeness, meaning no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 1 and item 4 (both at 96). Allocating these to Agent 0 maximizes their value.
- **Agent 1** has a strong preference for item 0 (value 74) and item 5 (value 67). Allocating these items to Agent 1 should maximize their satisfaction.
- **Agent 2** values item 3 (value 78) and item 5 (value 88) highly, but since item 5 is already allocated to Agent 1, we focus on item 3.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 0 and item 1, but item 0 is already allocated to Agent 1. Agent 3 can take item 2 (value 10) and item 5 for which they have a relatively high value (75).

Given these preferences and aiming for a fair distribution, the allocation can be structured as follows:

```
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4, where they have the highest valuations.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 5, maximizing their value.
- Agent 2 gets item 3, which they value highly, given remaining options.
- Agent 3 is allocated item 2, which is the best remaining option for them.

This allocation tries to reduce envy by giving each agent items they value highly, given the constraints.
