Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  85  99  10  23   7
1  62  47  19   2   5  57
2  46  52  94  86  82   7
3   3  77  89  91  24  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[19 85 99 10 23  7]
 [62 47 19  2  5 57]
 [46 52 94 86 82  7]
 [ 3 77 89 91 24 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as close to envy-free as possible, given that each agent must receive an integer number of items. Given the valuations, our goal is to allocate the 6 items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

### Valuations Table
```
          0   1   2   3   4   5
    0:   19  85  99  10  23   7
    1:   62  47  19   2   5  57
    2:   46  52  94  86  82   7
    3:    3  77  89  91  24  35
```

### Approach
1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Sum the valuations of each agent to get their total perceived value over all items.
   - Agent 0 Total: \(19 + 85 + 99 + 10 + 23 + 7 = 243\)
   - Agent 1 Total: \(62 + 47 + 19 + 2 + 5 + 57 = 192\)
   - Agent 2 Total: \(46 + 52 + 94 + 86 + 82 + 7 = 367\)
   - Agent 3 Total: \(3 + 77 + 89 + 91 + 24 + 35 = 319\)

2. **Assign Items Based on Valuations**: Aim to give each agent items that they value highly to minimize envy.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (99).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (62).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most, but it is already chosen by Agent 0, so the next highest is item 3 (86).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most, but it is already chosen by Agent 2, so the next highest is item 1 (77).

3. **Adjust to Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Since each agent must receive at least one item, we adjust allocations to distribute the remaining unallocated items.

### Allocation
- Assign items based on the highest values first, ensuring each agent receives some items while minimizing envy:
  - Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
  - Agent 1: Item [0]
  - Agent 2: Items [3, 5]
  - Agent 3: Item [1]

### Final Allocation
Below is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```
