Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26   9  82  94  64  56
1  21  94   2  97  46  48
2  96  95  78  77  33  61
3  97  87  52  64  87  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own, if possible.

To achieve this, we can use the following approach:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Adjust if necessary to ensure each agent gets at least one item, if feasible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26   9  82  94  64  56
1  21  94   2  97  46  48
2  96  95  78  77  33  61
3  97  87  52  64  87  20
```

For each item, identify the agent with the highest valuation:
- Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 97
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 94
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 82
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 97
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 64
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 61

Initial Maximum Value Allocation:
- Item 0 -> Agent 3
- Item 1 -> Agent 1
- Item 2 -> Agent 0
- Item 3 -> Agent 1
- Item 4 -> Agent 0
- Item 5 -> Agent 2

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: [2, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [0]

Checking if each agent gets at least one item and ensuring a total of 6 items are allocated, this allocation is valid. Each agent has their most valued items, with no agent having a strong preference for another's allocation given the constraints.

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their highest valuations, striving for a fair and envy-free division.
