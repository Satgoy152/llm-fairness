Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  89  52  81  88  39
1  22  21  77  89  84  20
2  57  18   2  75  76  33
3  13  13  23  58  66  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we should aim for each agent to feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, based on their individual valuations. 

One way to approach this is by using the method of "maximizing the minimum value," which attempts to ensure that the least satisfied agent is as satisfied as possible. This involves maximizing the minimum valuation each agent has for their allocated items.

Let's consider the agents' valuations for the items:

- Agent 0: [19, 89, 52, 81, 88, 39]
- Agent 1: [22, 21, 77, 89, 84, 20]
- Agent 2: [57, 18, 2, 75, 76, 33]
- Agent 3: [13, 13, 23, 58, 66, 98]

We need to distribute these items among the agents in a fair way. Analyzing the values, one possible allocation could be:

1. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3, who values it the most (98).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, who values it the most (89).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, who values it the most (77).
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, who values it the most (76).
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, who has a high value for it (75).
6. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, who has a relatively high value for it (22).

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent is reasonably satisfied with at least one of their items, if possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, maximizes individual valuations, and distributes the total of 6 items.
