Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  71  13  35  46  31
1  67  21  87  36  51  52
2  19  81  66  17  71  97
3  68  43  23  50  29  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [67 21 87 36 51 52]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [3, 71, 13, 35, 46, 31]
- Agent 1: [67, 21, 87, 36, 51, 52]
- Agent 2: [19, 81, 66, 17, 71, 97]
- Agent 3: [68, 43, 23, 50, 29, 94]

One method to approach this is by using a round-robin allocation based on priority determined by each agent's highest valued item. However, given the small number of items, we can try to assign items directly to achieve envy-free allocations.

Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is 71 for item 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is 87 for item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is 97 for item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is 68 for item 0.

Now, we have allocated:
- Item 1 to Agent 0
- Item 2 to Agent 1
- Item 5 to Agent 2
- Item 0 to Agent 3

Remaining items: 3, 4

Continue to allocate remaining items aiming to minimize envy:

5. **Agent 1**: Second highest value is 67 for item 0 (already allocated), next is 52 for item 5 (already allocated), next is 51 for item 4.
6. **Agent 3**: Second highest value is 50 for item 3.

Now, we have:
- Item 3 allocated to Agent 3
- Item 4 allocated to Agent 1

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [0, 3]

This allocation maintains a balance where each agent gets some of their highly valued items, and we distribute the items fairly.

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
