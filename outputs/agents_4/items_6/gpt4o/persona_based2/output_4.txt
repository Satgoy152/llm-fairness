Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  19  47  54   0  47
1  56   1  93   7  51  85
2  91  12  13  89  20   9
3  27  65  38  48  93  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent envies another's allocation, if possible. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with higher values for Agent 0. They value item 3 and item 2 highly compared to others.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most, followed by item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the most.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 the highest.

Given these preferences, let's try the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 0
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 5
- **Agent 2**: Item 1
- **Agent 3**: Item 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly according to their preferences. Let's list this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items among the agents while considering their valuations and attempting to minimize envy.
