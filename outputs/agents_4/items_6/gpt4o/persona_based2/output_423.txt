Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  19  30  12  39   4
1  14  62  48  15  92  71
2  18  32  90  50  43  58
3  29  66  33  81  38  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free assignment where each agent perceives their own bundle of items as at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle. Given that this is a zero-sum allocation with integer numbers of items, we will need to balance these allocations carefully.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate items that Agent 0 values moderately since Agent 0 has lower valuations overall compared to others. Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highest at 92, so we allocate this item to Agent 1. Agent 1 also gets item 1, which they value highly.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2, but since item 2 is allocated to Agent 0, we allocate items 5 and 3 to Agent 2, which they value moderately but collectively offer a considerable value.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 1 is allocated to Agent 1, and item 3 to Agent 2, so Agent 3 receives item 4, which they value moderately. However, to ensure all items are allocated, we can adjust accordingly. Agent 3 gets item 3, which they value highly.

Let's check the final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [5]
- **Agent 3**: Items [3]

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
