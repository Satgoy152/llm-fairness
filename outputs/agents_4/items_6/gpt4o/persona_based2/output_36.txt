Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  72  51  60  27  28
1  89  50  81  27  53  38
2  79  47  41  75  59  73
3  10  30  22  63  55  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 50 81 27 53 38]
 [79 47 41 75 59 73]
 [10 30 22 63 55 72]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent believes they have received at least as valuable a portion as any other agent. We need to take into account each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them in a way that minimizes envy.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values items 0, 1, 2 the most compared to others.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value of 78 for Agent 0).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values item 2 the most compared to others.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value of 81 for Agent 1).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values items 3 and 5 highly.
   - Allocate items 3 and 5 to Agent 2 (values of 75 and 73 for Agent 2).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values items 4 and 1 relatively highly compared to others.
   - Allocate items 4 and 1 to Agent 3 (values of 55 and 30 for Agent 3).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, minimizing envy. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation uses all 6 items and distributes them in a way that considers the valuations provided.
