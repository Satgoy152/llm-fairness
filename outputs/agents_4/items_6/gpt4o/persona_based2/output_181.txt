Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  73   3  37  77  53
1  58  18  10  96  44  75
2  73  29  37  17  98  74
3  69  95   6  88  84  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 73  3 37 77 53]
 [58 18 10 96 44 75]
 [73 29 37 17 98 74]
 [69 95  6 88 84 50]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is fair and envy-free, we should ensure that each agent is at least as happy with their own allocation as they would be with any other agent's allocation, given their own valuation. The goal is to make each agent feel that they are receiving a fair share of the total value.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [13, 73, 3, 37, 77, 53]
- Agent 1: [58, 18, 10, 96, 44, 75]
- Agent 2: [73, 29, 37, 17, 98, 74]
- Agent 3: [69, 95, 6, 88, 84, 50]

Let's try to allocate the items in a way that balances the value each agent receives. One potential approach is to distribute the items based on each agent's highest-valued items, while ensuring no agent is left with significantly less value than others.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Assign items based on highest value:** Each agent gets their most valued item, if possible.
2. **Balance remaining items:** Ensure remaining items are distributed to maintain fairness in total value.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Highest value is item 4 (77). Assign item 4.
- **Agent 1:** Highest value is item 3 (96). Assign item 3.
- **Agent 2:** Highest value is item 4 (98), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 5 (74). Assign item 5.
- **Agent 3:** Highest value is item 1 (95). Assign item 1.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Items left: 0, 2
- **Agent 0:** Next highest available value is item 1 (73), but it's taken. Assign item 0 (13).
- **Agent 3:** Next highest value available is item 2 (6). Assign item 2.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences while distributing all items.
