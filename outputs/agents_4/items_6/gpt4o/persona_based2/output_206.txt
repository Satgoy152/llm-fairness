Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  42  97  59  75  80
1  12  75  84  67  36  28
2  85  79  22  52  17  55
3  63  70  51  38  38   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 75 84 67 36 28]
 [85 79 22 52 17 55]
 [63 70 51 38 38  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll use a heuristic approach that considers the preferences of each agent. We aim to allocate the items such that no agent envies another, meaning each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  42  97  59  75  80
1  12  75  84  67  36  28
2  85  79  22  52  17  55
3  63  70  51  38  38   2
```

Based on the valuations, we look for allocations that maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (97), item 0 (85), and item 5 (80).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (84) and item 1 (75).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 0 (85) and item 1 (79).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1 (70) and item 0 (63).

To ensure a fair distribution, let's try the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 2 and 5. These are among the highest valued items for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3. While not the highest in their list, it is a reasonable choice given the constraints.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0. It's highly valued by Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 1 and 4. These are among the highest valued items for Agent 3 that are still available.

This allocation respects the preferences of each agent as much as possible while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 6 items and considers the highest preferences of each agent, aiming for a fair division where possible.
