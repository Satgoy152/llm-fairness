Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  43  72  74  70  65
1  86  73  65  93  36  65
2  22  17  86  59  62  37
3  40  49  36  50  66   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we'll consider the concept of envy-freeness, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. We will aim to allocate the items in such a way that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [21, 43, 72, 74, 70, 65]
- Agent 1: [86, 73, 65, 93, 36, 65]
- Agent 2: [22, 17, 86, 59, 62, 37]
- Agent 3: [40, 49, 36, 50, 66, 0]

We can attempt a round-robin or priority-based method to allocate items based on each agentâ€™s highest remaining valued item until all items are allocated. This helps in ensuring that each agent is reasonably satisfied with their allocation.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 3 (93), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 highly values item 4 (70), allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 2 (86), allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 4 (66), but it's already taken, so we allocate item 1 (49) to Agent 3.
5. Agent 1's next highest value is item 0 (86), allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
6. Agent 0's next highest value is item 5 (65), allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

Now, we present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the highest possible value from the remaining items when it's their turn, striving for a fair and envy-free distribution.
