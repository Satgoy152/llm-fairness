Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  36  11  42  87  57
1   7  71  94  44  91  39
2  25  68  15  92  16   8
3  33  63  77  66  83  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find an envy-free and fair division of the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a bundle of items that maximizes their utility based on their individual valuations, while attempting to ensure no agent envies another. 

Let's first consider which items are most valued by each agent:
- Agent 0: item 4 (value 87)
- Agent 1: item 2 (value 94)
- Agent 2: item 3 (value 92)
- Agent 3: item 2 (value 77)

From this, we can begin by trying to allocate these high-value items to the agents who value them the most. However, item 2 is highly valued by both agents 1 and 3, creating a potential conflict. We'll need to balance the allocation to ensure fairness and minimize envy.

We'll proceed with the following allocation strategy, considering each agent's highest-valued items and attempting to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (second-highest value after conflict on item 2).
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (next highest value to balance out).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (to balance out remaining value).

This allocation aims to balance each agent's valuations while respecting their preferences as much as possible:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5, Total Value = 87 + 57 = 144
- Agent 1: Item 2, Total Value = 94
- Agent 2: Item 3, Total Value = 92
- Agent 3: Items 1, 0, Total Value = 63 + 33 = 96

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives items they highly value and that the total valuation is balanced across agents to minimize envy.
