Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  37  47  71  37  95
1  42  93  86  69  39  92
2  30  60  66   8  37  77
3  54  56  65  72  37  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over that of any other agent. We can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach as a heuristic, which maximizes the product of the utilities of all agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Valuations for All Items**: Each agent's total valuation for all items together can give us an idea of their preferences.

2. **Pair Items with Agents to Balance Valuations**: Start by allocating the highest valued items to agents with the lowest total valuation, balancing the overall distribution.

3. **Iterate to Improve Fairness**: Swap items between agents if it increases the fairness, judged by the increase in the minimum utility or decrease in envy.

4. **Finalize the Allocation**: Ensure all items are allocated and all agents are considered.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [20, 37, 47, 71, 37, 95]
- Agent 1: [42, 93, 86, 69, 39, 92]
- Agent 2: [30, 60, 66, 8, 37, 77]
- Agent 3: [54, 56, 65, 72, 37, 25]

Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Allocate the Highest Valued Items**: 
   - Assign item 5 (highest value of 95) to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 (value of 93) to Agent 1.

2. **Distribute Remaining Items**: 
   - Assign item 2 (value of 66) to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 3 (value of 72) to Agent 3.

3. **Balance Remaining Items**:
   - Assign item 0 (value of 20) to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 (value of 37) to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the division considers the highest preferences first, balancing as much as possible:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation is an attempt to balance the total values each agent receives, while considering individual item preferences to minimize envy.
