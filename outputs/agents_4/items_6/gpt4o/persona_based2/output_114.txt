Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  25  64  91  44  62
1  41  28  52  17  93  89
2   7  31  43  83   1  14
3  63   9  27  62   8   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 28 52 17 93 89]
 [ 7 31 43 83  1 14]
 [63  9 27 62  8  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This approach helps in reducing envy among agents by ensuring that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation using the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 3 (91), 0 (76), 2 (64)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 4 (93), 5 (89), 2 (52)
   - Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 3 (83), 2 (43), 1 (31)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 0 (63), 3 (62), 2 (27)
   - Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 3.

This allocation is done in a way that tries to maximize individual satisfaction based on the highest value items available to each agent while ensuring each item is distributed.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items among the 4 agents, ensuring that each agent gets the best possible value from the items they receive based on their valuations.
