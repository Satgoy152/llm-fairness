Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  68   0  10  53  91
1   6  20  51  80  21  82
2  78  13  61   0  15  46
3  38  26  82  89  10  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 68  0 10 53 91]
 [ 6 20 51 80 21 82]
 [78 13 61  0 15 46]
 [38 26 82 89 10 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should value their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations:

```
Valuations Matrix:
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  68   0  10  53  91
1   6  20  51  80  21  82
2  78  13  61   0  15  46
3  38  26  82  89  10  59
```

We'll use a heuristic approach to make sure the allocation is as fair as possible. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 the highest (91), so we assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (80), so we assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest (78), so we assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest (89), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 2 (82), so we assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. Remaining items are 1 and 4. We need to allocate these:
   - Agent 0's next highest available is item 1 (68), so we assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest available is item 4 (21), so we assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's verify that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [0]
- Agent 3: Item [2]

All 6 items have been allocated, and each agent has at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```
