Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0   4  12  59  94   3
1  77  82  66  78  64  47
2  63  14  28  91  54  18
3  70  33  79  52   9  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, or at least approximately so, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** 
   Each agent values the items differently, and we need to assess the total value each agent assigns to the available items to balance the allocation.
   
2. **Proportional Shares:** 
   Calculate each agent's fair share assuming each agent should get an equal share of the total value of all items. 

3. **Greedy Allocation:** 
   Allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's individual valuations while keeping envy minimal.

4. **Adjust for Integer Allocation:** 
   Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are distributed. This might require some back-and-forth adjustments.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 1 values items 0 and 3 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 2 highly.

Now, we will allocate items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** Allocate item 4 (value 94).
2. **Agent 1:** Allocate items 0 and 3 (values 77, 78).
3. **Agent 2:** Allocate item 1 (value 14).
4. **Agent 3:** Allocate items 2 and 5 (values 79, 58).

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly and distributes all items:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This distribution tries to be as fair as possible given the constraints, ensuring that each agent receives items they value, while all items are allocated.
