Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  99  56  59  23  39
1  62  91  33  59   2  79
2   9  52  11  79  81  45
3  11  72   0   5  97  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 91 33 59  2 79]

 [11 72  0  5 97 18]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, let's consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives a subset of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

The table of valuations is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   18   |   99   |   56   |   59   |   23   |   39   |
|   1   |   62   |   91   |   33   |   59   |    2   |   79   |
|   2   |    9   |   52   |   11   |   79   |   81   |   45   |
|   3   |   11   |   72   |    0   |    5   |   97   |   18   |

Let's use a strategy to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation, minimizing envy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 1 the most, let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 0 the most, let's allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 4 the most, let's allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 4 the most, but since it's taken, let's consider their next best, item 1, which is also taken. Next, item 5 is available, so allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 2 and 3:

5. **Agent 0**: Their next preference after item 1 is item 2, so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 2**: Their next preference after item 4 is item 3, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the best possible items based on the remaining available items at their turn, trying to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
