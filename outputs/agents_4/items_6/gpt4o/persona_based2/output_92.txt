Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  64  96   8   7  51
1  93  53  14  31  52  64
2  17  54  45  92  74  26
3  60  18  86  71  60  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy, meaning each agent feels they have received a fair portion based on their own valuations. The challenge is to distribute the items such that no agent feels another agent has received more value than they have.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [58, 64, 96, 8, 7, 51]
Agent 1: [93, 53, 14, 31, 52, 64]
Agent 2: [17, 54, 45, 92, 74, 26]
Agent 3: [60, 18, 86, 71, 60, 81]
```

We'll try to distribute items to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while trying to maintain fairness. We will consider each agent's highest valued items and distribute accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (96), Item 1 (64), Item 0 (58)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (93), Item 5 (64), Item 1 (53)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (92), Item 4 (74), Item 1 (54)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (81), Item 2 (86), Item 3 (71)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, we have 2 items left: Item 1 and Item 4. We will allocate these by considering the remaining agent preferences:

- Agent 0 has already received Item 2, their highest preference.
- Agent 1 has already received Item 0, their highest preference.
- Agent 2 has already received Item 3, their highest preference.
- Agent 3 has already received Item 5, their highest preference.

Let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Item 1**: Highest remaining valuation for Item 1 is by Agent 0. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Highest remaining valuation for Item 4 is by Agent 2. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 5

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and it attempts to allocate based on each agent's highest preferences, reducing potential envy among the agents.
