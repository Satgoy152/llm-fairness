Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  62   2  17  67  35
1  33  88  16  76  76  19
2   2  16  85  69  31  94
3  31  98  49  68  80  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to distribute the items such that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their individual valuations. Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined:**  
   - Agent 0: \(21 + 62 + 2 + 17 + 67 + 35 = 204\)
   - Agent 1: \(33 + 88 + 16 + 76 + 76 + 19 = 308\)
   - Agent 2: \(2 + 16 + 85 + 69 + 31 + 94 = 297\)
   - Agent 3: \(31 + 98 + 49 + 68 + 80 + 85 = 411\)

2. **Allocate items to maximize each agent's value while considering envy-freeness:**  
   We aim to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly to minimize the potential for envy.

3. **Start assigning items to agents based on their preference values:**
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (98), so assign item 1 to agent 3.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 5 (94), assign item 5 to agent 2.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1, but it's already taken, so assign their next highest valued item, which is item 4 (76), to agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest, but it's taken, so assign their next highest valued item, item 1, to agent 0, but it’s taken. Continue to item 4 for agent 0, which is taken; therefore, assign item 0 (21) to agent 0.
   - Continue with the next highest available valued items, ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

4. **Finalize allocations:**
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1 as it’s not yet assigned and agent 1 values it highly.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 2 as agent 2 values it highly and it’s not yet assigned.
   - The only remaining item is item 5, which is already assigned to agent 2, so reassign item 5 to agent 3.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to consider each agent's preferences to the best extent possible while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
