Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  53  90  58  16  56
1  93  12  25  24  61  39
2  40  43  16  34  28  36
3  69  30  42  85  25  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we can use the following strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Use these total values to guide the allocation process, trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction while maintaining fairness.
3. Allocate items one by one, ensuring that each agent gets approximately equal total valuation from their allocated items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 11 + 53 + 90 + 58 + 16 + 56 = 284
- Agent 1: 93 + 12 + 25 + 24 + 61 + 39 = 254
- Agent 2: 40 + 43 + 16 + 34 + 28 + 36 = 199
- Agent 3: 69 + 30 + 42 + 85 + 25 + 50 = 301

Now, we will allocate items to the agents based on their preferences to achieve an envy-free division:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent to ensure satisfaction.
2. Allocate remaining items to balance total values among agents.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highest value items: 2 (90), 3 (58)
- Agent 1 highest value items: 0 (93)
- Agent 2 highest value items: 1 (43)
- Agent 3 highest value items: 3 (85), 5 (50)

Now, balance the allocation:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value for them)

The allocation strategy results in:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [3, 5]

This allocation attempts to balance satisfaction based on their valuations, trying to minimize envy among agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
