Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  21  17  95  46  53
1  93  89  63  20  92  73
2  88  64  55  58  88  11
3  45  10  72  23  47  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 64 55 58 88 11]
 [45 10 72 23 47 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that attempts to balance the overall satisfaction of each agent. One such method is the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking the most valuable remaining item according to their own valuations. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the table provided:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 3 (value 95).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 0 (value 93).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 0 (value 88, but since it's already taken, they pick item 4, value 88).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 5 (value 76).

Second round:

5. **Agent 0** picks item 5 (value 53, but since it's already taken, they pick item 4, value 46).
6. **Agent 1** picks item 4 (value 92, but since it's already taken, they pick item 5, value 73).

Revisiting:

7. **Agent 2** picks item 2 (value 55).
8. **Agent 3** picks item 0 (value 45, but since it's already taken, they choose item 2, value 72).

Now, let's ensure everyone gets their fair share and all items are allocated. We have already allocated six items. Let's check if everyone has an item, and adjust if necessary.

Adjustments:

- Since Agent 2 and Agent 3 had conflicts in their choices, we will adjust the allocation to ensure fairness while respecting envy-freeness as much as possible.

Final allocations:

- **Agent 0**: [3]
- **Agent 1**: [0]
- **Agent 2**: [4, 2]
- **Agent 3**: [5, 1]

This allocation gives each agent a number of items totaling 6, with consideration for envy-freeness and agent preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```
