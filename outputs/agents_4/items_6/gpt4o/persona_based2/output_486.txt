Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  57  18  66  36   9
1  97  68  58   2  46  88
2  59  10   0  37  92   8
3  40  86  52  17  52  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims to minimize envy among the agents, we can use methods such as maximizing the Nash product or minimizing the maximum envy. Here, I'll aim for an allocation that attempts to balance envy and fairness based on the provided valuations.

Let's first outline the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [72, 57, 18, 66, 36, 9]
- Agent 1: [97, 68, 58, 2, 46, 88]
- Agent 2: [59, 10, 0, 37, 92, 8]
- Agent 3: [40, 86, 52, 17, 52, 36]

Given these valuations, letâ€™s aim to fairly allocate the items. The goal is also to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, to reduce potential envy and increase fairness.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0 (72 value)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 5 (88 value)
   - Item 1 (68 value)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 (92 value)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 3 (17 value)
   - Item 2 (52 value)

### Rationale:

- **Agent 0** gets item 0, which they value the highest at 72.
- **Agent 1** receives items 5 and 1, which they value at 88 and 68 respectively, the highest combination available.
- **Agent 2** gets item 4, which they value the highest at 92.
- **Agent 3** receives items 3 and 2, which combine for a decent value (17 + 52) and are among the higher-valued items they would ideally receive.

This allocation tries to balance the total value each agent receives and attempts to ensure that no agent feels significantly envious of another, given the constraints of integer allocations.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents and attempts to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints.
