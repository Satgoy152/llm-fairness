Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  36  92  38  25  86
1  81  39   2  49  48  76
2  56  41  23  24  23   2
3  87  60  18  84  18  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve envy-freeness and fairness in allocation, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Envy-freeness is achieved if each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. In this specific case, where each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, we will focus on maximizing each agent's total valuation of their allocation.

Let's evaluate the best possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 2 (92), 0 (91), and 5 (86).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 0 (81), 5 (76), and 3 (49).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for items 1 (41), 0 (56), and 2 (23).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuations are for items 0 (87), 3 (84), and 5 (71).

Given these preferences and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, we try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0 should receive items they value the most but not at the expense of creating envy.
- Agent 1 can be satisfied with a combination that includes items 3 and 4, which are less valued by others.
- Agent 2 can receive lower-valued items, since their valuations are generally lower.
- Agent 3 should receive items that are highly valued by them but not causing envy to others.

After considering these factors, here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0 and 2. (Total valuation = 91 + 92 = 183)
- **Agent 1:** Items 4 and 5. (Total valuation = 48 + 76 = 124)
- **Agent 2:** Item 1. (Total valuation = 41)
- **Agent 3:** Item 3. (Total valuation = 84)

This allocation assigns all items and tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
``` 

This configuration attempts to ensure fairness and minimize envy by aligning with each agent's preferences as much as possible while distributing all items.
