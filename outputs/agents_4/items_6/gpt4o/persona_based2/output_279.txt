Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  90  55  32  41  77
1  91  17  33  82  33  57
2  10  52  73  20  68  86
3  78  56  93   2  76  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received an equitable share based on their valuations. The goal is to minimize envy, where possible, while giving each agent items they value as much as possible.

Let's examine the matrix of valuations for each agent:

```
Agent 0: [77, 90, 55, 32, 41, 77]
Agent 1: [91, 17, 33, 82, 33, 57]
Agent 2: [10, 52, 73, 20, 68, 86]
Agent 3: [78, 56, 93, 2, 76, 71]
```

To allocate the items in a way that aims to reduce envy, let's consider each agent's highest valued items and attempt to distribute them accordingly. We can use a round-robin approach starting with the highest valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 (90).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (91).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5 (86).
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 2 (93).

After allocating each of these items based on the highest individual valuations, we have:
- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 3 and 4. We can allocate these based on the next highest valuations among the remaining items for each agent:

- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this at 82, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item.
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values this at 76, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [2, 4]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by allocating items based on each agent's highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.
