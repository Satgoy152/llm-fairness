Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53   0  98   0  37  32
1  61  59  94  45  59  52
2  94  50  26   5   6   0
3  81  63  17  82  39  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 50 26  5  6  0]
 [81 63 17 82 39 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim for a distribution that attempts to maximize fairness and minimize envy. A potential approach is to use the "envy-free" principle where each agent should not prefer another agent's allocation over their own given their personal valuations.

Given the valuation matrix:

| Agents/Items | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 53 | 0  | 98 | 0  | 37 | 32 |
| 1            | 61 | 59 | 94 | 45 | 59 | 52 |
| 2            | 94 | 50 | 26 | 5  | 6  | 0  |
| 3            | 81 | 63 | 17 | 82 | 39 | 97 |

Let's analyze and allocate based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction.

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the highest (98), so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: After item 2 is taken, agent 1 values item 0 the highest (61). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the highest (94), but since item 0 is taken, the next highest is item 1 (50). Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the highest (97), allocate item 5 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, and 5. We need to allocate the remaining items, 3 and 4.

5. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most (82), allocate item 3 to agent 3.
6. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (59), allocate item 4 to agent 1.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [5, 3]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```
