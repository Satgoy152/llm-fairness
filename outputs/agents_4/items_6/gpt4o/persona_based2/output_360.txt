Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  50  48  74   8  41
1  69  98  44  56  22  79
2  76  57  80  59   9  30
3  76  76   1  57  41  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that satisfies envy-freeness as much as possible, given the constraints of integer item distribution.

First, let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 35 + 50 + 48 + 74 + 8 + 41 = 256
- Agent 1: 69 + 98 + 44 + 56 + 22 + 79 = 368
- Agent 2: 76 + 57 + 80 + 59 + 9 + 30 = 311
- Agent 3: 76 + 76 + 1 + 57 + 41 + 53 = 304

Next, we allocate the items in a manner that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction, considering their respective valuations. We also aim to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items that they value highly.

A possible allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations per agent, ensuring that each item is only assigned once and each agent receives as close to an equal number of items as possible.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Values item 3 at 74 (highest), item 1 at 50, and item 2 at 48
- Agent 1:
  - Values item 1 at 98 (highest), item 5 at 79
- Agent 2:
  - Values item 2 at 80 (highest), item 0 at 76
- Agent 3:
  - Values item 0 at 76 (highest), item 1 at 76

Taking into account these preferences and aiming to distribute all items fairly, we can assign the items as follows:

- Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1 and Agent 3, but since Agent 1 values it the most, it goes to Agent 1.
- Item 0 is valued equally by Agent 2 and Agent 3, but since Agent 2 also values item 2 highly, we can give item 0 to Agent 3.
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 2, so it goes to Agent 2.
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0, so it goes to Agent 0.
- Item 4 does not have high valuations, but Agent 3 values it more than others, so it goes to Agent 3.
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 1, so it goes to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value relatively highly, while minimizing envy as best as possible given the constraints.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
