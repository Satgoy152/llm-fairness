Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  42   3  31  17  37
1   9  72   1  56  96  86
2  70  42  46  33  43  18
3  64  54   6  69  69  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 72  1 56 96 86]
 [70 42 46 33 43 18]
 [64 54  6 69 69 87]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that the allocation minimizes envy. Since there are 4 agents and 6 items, some agents will receive more items than others, but we will strive to balance the overall satisfaction.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 highly.
   - Agent 3 values item 5 highly.

2. **Allocating High-Value Items**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 values it the most (value 70).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it the most (value 96).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 3 because Agent 3 values it the most (value 87).

3. **Allocating Remaining Items**:
   - Items left to allocate: 1, 2, 3.
   - Agent 0 has not received any items yet, and values item 1 highly. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 3 values item 3 highly among the remaining items. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Finally, item 2 is left. Assign it to Agent 0, as it increases their total allocation without causing envy.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives item 4.
   - Agent 2 receives item 0.
   - Agent 3 receives items 3 and 5.

This allocation considers the highest individual values and aims to balance the distribution to minimize envy. 

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
