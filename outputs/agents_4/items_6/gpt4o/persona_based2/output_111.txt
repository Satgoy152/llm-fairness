Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  58  27   5  56  81
1  34   8  80  52  65   2
2   2  43   7  49  89   1
3  64  38  30  56   7  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 43  7 49 89  1]
 [64 38 30 56  7 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuation for each item and try to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. Here, our goal is to assign items such that every agent feels they have received a fair portion of the total value, according to their valuations.

### Valuations table:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  58  27   5  56  81
1  34   8  80  52  65   2
2   2  43   7  49  89   1
3  64  38  30  56   7  51
```

### Allocation Strategy:
To achieve a fair distribution, we will:
1. Prioritize assigning high-valued items to agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure every agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values this item the most with a valuation of 64.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item the most with a valuation of 58.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item the most with a valuation of 80.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values this item the most with a valuation of 56.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values this item the most with a valuation of 89.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values this item the most with a valuation of 81.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the highest-value items, according to each agent's valuations, are distributed to those who value them the most. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.
