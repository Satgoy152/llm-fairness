Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  20  15  23  30  13
1  24  93  77  29  58  64
2  61   7  30  37  53  27
3  32  74  36  78  24  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 93 77 29 58 64]
 [61  7 30 37 53 27]
 [32 74 36 78 24 39]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. We can try to balance the total value each agent receives from their allocated items.

Firstly, let's calculate the total value each agent places on all the items:

- Agent 0: 28 + 20 + 15 + 23 + 30 + 13 = 129
- Agent 1: 24 + 93 + 77 + 29 + 58 + 64 = 345
- Agent 2: 61 + 7 + 30 + 37 + 53 + 27 = 215
- Agent 3: 32 + 74 + 36 + 78 + 24 + 39 = 283

Next, we aim to distribute the items such that the sum of values of the items allocated to each agent is as balanced as possible. Considering the valuations and trying to minimize envy, we can attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Allocate items 0, 2  
   - Total value: 28 (item 0) + 15 (item 2) = 43

2. **Agent 1:** Allocate items 1, 5  
   - Total value: 93 (item 1) + 64 (item 5) = 157

3. **Agent 2:** Allocate item 4  
   - Total value: 53 (item 4) = 53

4. **Agent 3:** Allocate item 3  
   - Total value: 78 (item 3) = 78

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations and tries to minimize envy. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the 4 agents, and each agent receives at least one item, maintaining an attempt to balance the total value perceived by each agent.
