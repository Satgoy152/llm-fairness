Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  19  31   8  42  33
1  42  23  82  21  49  12
2  15  75  56  20  62  52
3  14  87  83  89  78  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 75 56 20 62 52]
 [14 87 83 89 78 41]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the overall allocation is as envy-free as possible given the valuations. Envy-freeness means no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items highest as follows: Item 0 (50), Item 4 (42).
2. **Agent 1**: Values items highest as follows: Item 2 (82), Item 4 (49).
3. **Agent 2**: Values items highest as follows: Item 1 (75), Item 4 (62).
4. **Agent 3**: Values items highest as follows: Item 3 (89), Item 1 (87).

Given that each agent must receive at least one item and we have 6 items total, we can distribute them as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 5
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 4
- **Agent 3**: Items 1, 3

This allocation tries to respect the highest value items for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.
