Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  98  57  84  82  17
1  19  78  80  81  60  29
2  47  12  48  54   3  34
3  81  99  25  63  82  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to create an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own based on their valuation of the items.

Here, we have 4 agents and 6 items, so some agents will receive more than one item, while others might receive fewer. Let's try to allocate these items in a way that maximizes fairness.

The valuations of the agents for each item are as follows:

```
Agent 0: [9, 98, 57, 84, 82, 17]
Agent 1: [19, 78, 80, 81, 60, 29]
Agent 2: [47, 12, 48, 54, 3, 34]
Agent 3: [81, 99, 25, 63, 82, 14]
```

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Identify high-value items**: Items 1 and 3 have high values for multiple agents, so they should be distributed to maximize satisfaction.

2. **Allocate based on highest valuation**:
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it the highest (99), so allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it highly (84), so allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance allocations**:
   - Item 0: Allocate to Agent 3, who values it at 81 (second-highest), to complement the high-value Item 1.
   - Item 2: Allocate to Agent 1, who values it at 80 (highest among the unallocated).
   - Item 4: Allocate to Agent 0, who values it at 82 (highest among the unallocated).
   - Item 5: Allocate to Agent 2, who values it at 34 (highest among the unallocated).

Following this process, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 1]

Let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
