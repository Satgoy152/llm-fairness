Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  29  63  90  95  65
1  38  32  12  15  24  56
2  82  21  14   4  45  97
3  52  98  44  82  42  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents in a manner that aims for envy-freeness, we need to take into account the valuations of each agent for each item. One common approach is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" or "Envy-Free" allocation, but given the integer constraint (each agent must receive an integer number of items) and the objective to distribute all items, we can use a heuristic approach.

Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuations for items 0, 3, and 4. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Since Agent 1 has lower valuations across the board, we'll assign them items with relatively lower valuations from other agents. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 5, but since item 5 is already allocated, we'll consider their second highest valuation. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 the most. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

This allocation is an attempt to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives items that are valued relatively highly by them.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items and attempts to balance the valuations across the agents.
