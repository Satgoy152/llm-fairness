Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  61  74  94  26  14
1  76  21  53  49  81  17
2  11  76  49  63  34   3
3  73  29  12  16  87  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "Adjusted Winner Procedure" or a "Greedy Algorithm" based on maximizing happiness per agent while balancing the allocation. Given the complexity and the need for integer allocations, a heuristic approach like "Greedy Round Robin" can work well, adjusting as needed to ensure all items are allocated, and trying to minimize envy.

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - There are 4 agents and 6 items.
   - Each agent should ideally get at least 1 item, given there are more items than agents.
   - The total valuation for each item by all agents is as follows:
     - Item 0: 189
     - Item 1: 187
     - Item 2: 188
     - Item 3: 222
     - Item 4: 228
     - Item 5: 74

2. **Greedy Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by allocating the most valued item to each agent in a round-robin fashion.
   - Continue the allocation until all items are assigned, adjusting to balance the allocations.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Allocate items based on descending order of each agent's preference for unallocated items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets item 3 (highest value 94).
- **Agent 1** gets item 4 (highest value 81).
- **Agent 2** gets item 1 (highest value 76).
- **Agent 3** gets item 0 (highest value 73).
- Remaining items are 2 and 5, which we allocate based on remaining preferences.

- **Agent 2** already has item 1, now gets item 2 (next preference 49).
- **Agent 0** gets item 5 (next preference 14, since it has the next highest value for an unallocated item).

4. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy given each agent's preferences. The allocation is also integer-based and uses all 6 items.
