Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  10  85  48  48  30
1   9  80  21  94  53  80
2  25  53  43  69  44  99
3  70  41  91  80  23  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent. This process involves iteratively assigning items to agents based on maximizing utility and maintaining fairness. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initialize**: Start with all items unallocated and each agent having a value of zero for their bundle.

2. **Prioritize High Valuations**: Allocate items to agents who value them the most, ensuring no agent is envious of another's allocation given their own preferences.

3. **Balance Total Values**: Adjust allocations to balance the total perceived value for each agent as closely as possible.

4. **Iterate through Items**: Use a heuristic to assign items one by one, aiming to maximize utility for the most envious agent at each step.

5. **Check for Envy**: After each allocation, ensure that no agent would prefer another's allocation over their own based on their valuation, adjusting if necessary.

Let's apply this method to the given valuations:

- **Initial Allocation**:
  - Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 85, the highest valuation for this item).
  - Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 94, the highest valuation for this item).
  - Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 99, the highest valuation for this item).
  - Assign item 0 to agent 3 (value 70, the highest valuation for this item).

- **Remaining Items**:
  - Item 1: Assign to agent 1 (value 80, highest available).
  - Item 4: Assign to agent 0 (value 48, highest remaining).

This allocation tries to maximize the total value for each agent and aims to be envy-free given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

Each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation attempts to respect the highest valuations while balancing perceived fairness.
