Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  89  39  24  81  80
1  17   7  49  22   2  76
2   8  60  18  44  68  59
3   2   9  99  81  26   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly based on the given valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure a fair distribution of the total value. One approach is to use an envy-free algorithm such as the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or a heuristic approach that balances the total value among the agents.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [6, 89, 39, 24, 81, 80]
Agent 1: [17, 7, 49, 22, 2, 76]
Agent 2: [8, 60, 18, 44, 68, 59]
Agent 3: [2, 9, 99, 81, 26, 5]
```

We need to assign the items such that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. This can be done by iteratively assigning items to agents in a way that balances the value distribution.

**Allocation Strategy:**
1. Prioritize items with the highest unique value for an agent to reduce potential envy.
2. If multiple agents have high values for the same item, consider the impact of the allocation on the overall balance of values.

**Fair Allocation:**
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value: 89).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 (highest value: 99).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value: 76).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value: 68).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (significant secondary value: 81).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (secondary value: 17).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item while trying to minimize overall envy.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This distribution considers the highest-valued items for each agent and attempts to balance the total value received by each agent, leading to a more fair and envy-free allocation.
