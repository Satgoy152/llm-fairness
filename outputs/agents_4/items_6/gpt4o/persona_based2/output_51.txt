Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  17  17  74   9  17
1  53  90  18  45  33  86
2  40  16  40  86  95  85
3  97  93  57  99  70  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 17 17 74  9 17]
 [53 90 18 45 33 86]
 [40 16 40 86 95 85]
 [97 93 57 99 70 81]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents such that envy-freeness is maintained as much as possible, we need to consider the valuations presented in the table. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that they value highly relative to the items they do not receive.

Let's review the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [83, 17, 17, 74, 9, 17]
- Agent 1: [53, 90, 18, 45, 33, 86]
- Agent 2: [40, 16, 40, 86, 95, 85]
- Agent 3: [97, 93, 57, 99, 70, 81]

We will attempt to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while also maintaining a balance so that no agent feels envious of another:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (83) and item 3 (74).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (90) and item 5 (86).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (95) and item 3 (86) but since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, we need to find alternatives.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (99) but since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can give them item 0 (97).

With these preferences in mind, here's a fair allocation plan:

- Assign item 0 to **Agent 0**.
- Assign items 1 and 5 to **Agent 1**.
- Assign item 4 to **Agent 2**.
- Assign items 2 and 3 to **Agent 3**.

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences, while ensuring all items are distributed. 

Let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
