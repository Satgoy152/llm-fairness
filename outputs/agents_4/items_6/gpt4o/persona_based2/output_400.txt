Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  52  71  26  47  44
1  92  29  80  44  73   4
2   0  36  70  85  71  59
3  13   1  19  45  35  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share given their personal valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values items highly overall, with item 2 as the highest.
- Agent 1: Values item 0 and 2 highly.
- Agent 2: Values item 3 as the highest.
- Agent 3: Values item 5 as the highest.

A possible strategy is to assign items such that each agent gets an item they value highly, if possible, while ensuring that no agent envies another.

Here's a possible envy-free allocation:

1. Agent 0: Assign item 2, which they value the highest.
2. Agent 1: Assign item 0, which they value the highest.
3. Agent 2: Assign item 3, which they value the highest.
4. Agent 3: Assign item 5, which they value the highest.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (1 and 4) to balance the allocation:

- Agent 0 can also receive item 1 as it values it second highest after item 2.
- Agent 1 can receive item 4, as it values it second highest after item 0.

Thus, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: [2, 1]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [5]

This allocation is designed to minimize envy since each agent receives at least one of their top-valued items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5]
}
```
