Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  67  52  53  52  59
1  92  99   9  13  56  58
2  53  16  76  13  11  63
3  40  41  75  21  72  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 67 52 53 52 59]
 [92 99  9 13 56 58]
 [53 16 76 13 11 63]
 [40 41 75 21 72 76]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Given the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  67  52  53  52  59
1  92  99   9  13  56  58
2  53  16  76  13  11  63
3  40  41  75  21  72  76
```

We will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives items they highly value, and the allocation is balanced across agents.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has a very high valuation for item 1 (99), so it is reasonable to allocate item 1 to agent 1.
  
2. **Agent 0** values item 5 highly (59), so allocate item 5 to agent 0.

3. **Agent 2** values item 2 very highly (76), so allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly (72), so allocate item 4 to agent 3.

5. Now, we have items 0 and 3 left. Let's see how to allocate them:

   - **Agent 1** also values item 0 highly (92), so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
   - **Agent 0** values item 3 highly (53), which seems to be the highest remaining value for that item, so allocate item 3 to agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [2]
- Agent 3: Items [4]

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's highest valued items while ensuring each has at least one item and the total items allocated are six.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
