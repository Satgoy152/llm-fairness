Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  18  84  32  94   8
1  22  95  16  91   0  63
2  60  19  55  27   1   6
3  29  14  60   1  10  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 18 84 32 94  8]
 [22 95 16 91  0 63]
 [60 19 55 27  1  6]
 [29 14 60  1 10 96]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. We need to ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent's allocation is as close to their preference as possible. Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Valuations Table

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  18  84  32  94   8
1  22  95  16  91   0  63
2  60  19  55  27   1   6
3  29  14  60   1  10  96
```

### Analysis

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (98) and item 4 (94).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (95) and item 3 (91).
3. **Agent 2** does not have very high preferences, but relatively values item 0 (60) and item 2 (55) more than others.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (96).

### Allocation Strategy

- Allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed fairly.
- Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, based on their preferences.

### Proposed Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Give them items 0 and 4, which they value highly.
- **Agent 1**: Give them items 1 and 3, which they value highly.
- **Agent 2**: Give them item 2, which they have relatively higher valuation for.
- **Agent 3**: Give them item 5, which they value highly.

### Resulting Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are allocated.
