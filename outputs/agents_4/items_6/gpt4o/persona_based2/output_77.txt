Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  49  53  67  30  66
1  74  10  10  30   6   6
2  99   5  38  76  62   7
3  25  13  71  47  15  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or using a round-robin approach based on valuations. Here, I'll attempt a simple allocation strategy where we try to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's calculate some potential allocations:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued item to each agent where possible, then fill in the rest.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

- **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 3 (67) and item 5 (66). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 0 (74) the most. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (38) and item 3 (76). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 2 (71) the most. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [2]

Remaining items are 1 and 4. Let's allocate based on remaining high valuations:
- **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 1 (49). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 2** has a reasonable valuation for item 4 (62). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:
Let's check all assignments:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 1] with valuations (66, 49)
- Agent 1: Item [0] with valuation (74)
- Agent 2: Items [3, 4] with valuations (76, 62)
- Agent 3: Item [2] with valuation (71)

This allocation should balance the valuations quite well. 

Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, while all items are distributed.
