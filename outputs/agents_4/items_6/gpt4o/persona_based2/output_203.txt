Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  11  16  65  49  86
1  30  47  52  54   8  64
2  82  53  51  75  90  98
3  87  52  20   0   5  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 11 16 65 49 86]
 [30 47 52 54  8 64]
 [82 53 51 75 90 98]
 [87 52 20  0  5 72]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that there are six items and four agents, each agent will receive at least one item, and some will receive two.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 as it has the highest value (86) for them.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most with a value of 52. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5, but since it's already allocated, we assign item 4 to Agent 2, which has a high valuation of 90.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 (87). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [0]

Remaining items to allocate are item 1 and item 3.

5. **Allocation of Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly (65), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highly (47), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [5, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 1]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [0]

Thus, the allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
