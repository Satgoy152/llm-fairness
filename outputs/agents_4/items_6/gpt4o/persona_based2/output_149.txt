Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  96  93  70  83  76
1  27  80  68  23  27  60
2  41  59  69  95  11  14
3   9   9  23  89  19  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 96 93 70 83 76]
 [27 80 68 23 27 60]
 [41 59 69 95 11 14]
 [ 9  9 23 89 19 74]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, aiming to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we can try to find an allocation that maximizes fairness.

Let's first examine the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 13 + 96 + 93 + 70 + 83 + 76 = 431
- Agent 1: 27 + 80 + 68 + 23 + 27 + 60 = 285
- Agent 2: 41 + 59 + 69 + 95 + 11 + 14 = 289
- Agent 3: 9 + 9 + 23 + 89 + 19 + 74 = 223

Next, we will try to allocate the items so that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. We aim to minimize envy among the agents.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Assign high-value items to agents who value them most**: 
   - Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0 (96), so assign it to Agent 0.
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 2 (95), so assign it to Agent 2.

2. **Assign remaining items with consideration to balance the total value for each agent**:
   - Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2 (41), so assign it to Agent 2.
   - Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 0 (83), so assign it to Agent 0.
   - Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 3 (74), so assign it to Agent 3.
   - Item 2 has a high value for Agent 0 (93), but considering the balance, assign it to Agent 1 who values it (68).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3
- Agent 3: Item 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and balances their valuations as much as possible, minimizing envy.
