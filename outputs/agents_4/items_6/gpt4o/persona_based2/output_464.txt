Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  52  61  47  84  85
1   0  75  13  89  71  55
2  82  20  12  34  49  11
3  36  41  49  36  60  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that aims for fairness and envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to allocate the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, while also ensuring no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items**: 
   - Item 5 (value 85)
   - Item 4 (value 84)
   
2. **Agent 1's highest valued items**:
   - Item 3 (value 89)
   - Item 1 (value 75)
   
3. **Agent 2's highest valued items**:
   - Item 0 (value 82)
   - Item 4 (value 49)
   
4. **Agent 3's highest valued items**:
   - Item 4 (value 60)
   - Item 2 (value 49)

Following these observations, we can start allocating based on the highest valuations:

- **Agent 0**: We'll assign item 5 (85) and item 4 (84), which are the highest valued items for agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (89) and item 1 (75), which are the highest valued for agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 0 (82), which is the highest valued item for agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 2 (49), which is the highest valued item for agent 3.

This allocation gives each agent at least one of their top-valued items. Let's ensure there are no unallocated items and that the allocations are correct:

- Agent 0: [5, 4]
- Agent 1: [3, 1]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [2]

This results in a total of 6 items being allocated, satisfying the requirement.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest preferences of each agent and ensures that all items are distributed.
