Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  77  99  53  48  64
1  45  21   9  98  31  47
2  79  32  75  24  20   4
3  12  16  93  48   1  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent places on each item. The key is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the perceived value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share.

One approach to ensure fairness is to apply the "Adjusted Winner" procedure, or any algorithm that aims to minimize envy by considering the ordinal rankings of items by each agent. However, given the problem constraints and the need for simplicity, we'll use a heuristic method, ensuring each agent gets at least one item based on their highest valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 2 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 3 (98).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 0 (79).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 2, but it's already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 3, but it's taken by Agent 1. Next is item 1 (16).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items by considering the second highest valuations or balancing:

- **Remaining Items**: 4, 5
- **Agent 0**: Next highest valuation available is item 1 (77), but it's taken. We'll give item 5 (64).
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (31) is available.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 0; no more allocation needed.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 1; no more allocation needed.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
