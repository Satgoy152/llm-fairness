Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  53   1  35  82  89
1  63  15  96  20   3  97
2  73  24  68  97  96   0
3  77  91  56  22   4  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 53  1 35 82 89]
 [63 15 96 20  3 97]
 [73 24 68 97 96  0]
 [77 91 56 22  4 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a method such as the "maximum envy-free allocation" or a similar heuristic. Given the valuations in the table, we will attempt to assign items in a manner that minimizes envy and maximizes each agent's satisfaction.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [94, 53, 1, 35, 82, 89]
Agent 1: [63, 15, 96, 20, 3, 97]
Agent 2: [73, 24, 68, 97, 96, 0]
Agent 3: [77, 91, 56, 22, 4, 38]
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 0** (highest value 94 for Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1** (highest value 91 for Agent 3): Assign to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2** (highest value 96 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3** (highest value 97 for Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4** (highest value 96 for Agent 2): Since Agent 2 already has Item 3, consider next highest value. Second highest value 82 for Agent 0: Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5** (highest value 97 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1

With this allocation, each agent receives items that they value highly, and the total of 6 items is distributed among the agents.

{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
