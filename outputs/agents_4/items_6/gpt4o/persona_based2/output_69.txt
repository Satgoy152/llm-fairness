Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  71  39  34  63   0
1  94  82  12  40  45  59
2  48   8  85  14  16  96
3  30  82  71  73  68  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents, we aim to minimize envy and distribute the items according to the agents' valuations. A common approach to ensuring fairness is the Envy-Free allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their allocation.

Given the valuations, we can use a strategic approach to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 1 (71) and item 4 (63).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 0 (94) and item 1 (82).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 5 (96) and item 2 (85).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 1 (82) and item 3 (73).

To balance these preferences, and since each agent should get approximately equal satisfaction, we prioritize allocating high-value items to the respective agents while considering the overall balance:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (71)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 0 (94)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 (96)
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 (73)

Now, we have allocated 4 out of 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items, ensuring that the allocations remain as envy-free as possible:

- **Agent 0**: Can also take item 4 (63) because it is the next highest value for them and does not cause envy as they already have a high-value item.
- **Agent 2**: Can take item 2 (85) as it is their next highest value item.

Thus, the final allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 5 and 2
- Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation ensures that each agent's highest-priority items are respected, and no agent strongly envies another's allocation given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
