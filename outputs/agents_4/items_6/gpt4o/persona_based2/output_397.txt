Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  97  10  57  12  16
1   7  84  96  68  53  68
2  85  62  75  90  47  49
3  70  82  49  78  63  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items such that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation relative to the others. Given the constraints, we'll try to allocate the items such that each agent either feels they have received a fair share or at least their envy towards other allocations is minimized.

Let's start by considering the highest value each agent assigns to any item and try to allocate those items to them if possible. We will also ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Here are the highest valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 97.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 96.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 90.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 82.

Based on these valuations, a direct allocation strategy would be:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Next, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 4, 5) to ensure each agent has at least one item, and we aim to balance based on value:
- Agent 0 also values item 0 at 71. We can assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 3 has not been assigned any item yet. Among the remaining items, they value item 4 the highest at 63, so we assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Finally, assign item 5 to Agent 1, as they value it at 68, which is significant relative to their other options.

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value by each agent:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 5.
- Agent 2: Item 3.
- Agent 3: Item 4.

Let's present this allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all six items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
