Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  80  18  92  81   8
1  34  51  13  46  23  36
2  53  68  72  34  17  23
3  22  96  14  30  70  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction while maintaining envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the constraints of integer allocations and the need to allocate exactly six items, I will use a heuristic approach to assign the items.

The valuations for each agent for each item are as follows:

- Agent 0: [66, 80, 18, 92, 81, 8]
- Agent 1: [34, 51, 13, 46, 23, 36]
- Agent 2: [53, 68, 72, 34, 17, 23]
- Agent 3: [22, 96, 14, 30, 70, 50]

First, I will evaluate which items are most valued by each agent and attempt to allocate these items to them if it doesn't cause significant envy to other agents.

1. **Identify Highest Valued Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (92), followed by item 1 (80), and item 4 (81).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (51), followed by item 5 (36), and item 3 (46).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (72), followed by item 1 (68), and item 0 (53).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (96), followed by item 4 (70), and item 5 (50).

2. **Allocate Items to Reduce Envy:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3, as it is their highest valued item, and also highly valued by Agent 0, reducing potential envy.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued item.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it is their third highest valued item.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3, as it is valued relatively high by them.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their next highest valued item.

This allocation tries to balance the valuations and minimize envy among agents. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among agents while attempting to minimize envy and maximize each agent's satisfaction within the constraints provided.
