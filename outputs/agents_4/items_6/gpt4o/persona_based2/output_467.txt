Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  91   5  46   0  80
1  32  27  66  68  73  41
2  24  74  40   0  47  59
3  10  91  81  94  53  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 7 91  5 46  0 80]
 [32 27 66 68 73 41]
 [24 74 40  0 47 59]
 [10 91 81 94 53 37]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, which means no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the valuations, we can try to allocate items in a way that balances the total value received by each agent.

Let's calculate the initial total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 7 + 91 + 5 + 46 + 0 + 80 = 229
- Agent 1 total valuation: 32 + 27 + 66 + 68 + 73 + 41 = 307
- Agent 2 total valuation: 24 + 74 + 40 + 0 + 47 + 59 = 244
- Agent 3 total valuation: 10 + 91 + 81 + 94 + 53 + 37 = 366

A simple approach can be to allocate the highest valued items to each agent until all items are distributed. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (91), 5 (80)
   - Allocate: [1, 5]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 4 (73), 3 (68)
   - Allocate: [4, 3]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (74), 5 (59)
   - Allocate: [2] (item 1 and 5 are already taken)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (94), 2 (81), 1 (91)
   - Allocate: [0]

Let's check the final allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 5]
- Agent 1: [4, 3]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [0]

Now, let's present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
