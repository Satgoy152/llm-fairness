Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  41  32  54  13  44
1  42  57  55  32  10  32
2  92  69  85   0  62  91
3  35   4  73  47  37  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **List the total valuations each agent has for all items:**
   - Agent 0: 0 + 41 + 32 + 54 + 13 + 44 = 184
   - Agent 1: 42 + 57 + 55 + 32 + 10 + 32 = 228
   - Agent 2: 92 + 69 + 85 + 0 + 62 + 91 = 399
   - Agent 3: 35 + 4 + 73 + 47 + 37 + 20 = 216

2. **Allocate items to achieve approximate envy-freeness:**
   - Start by identifying which items are highly valued by each agent.
   - Attempt to distribute items so that the total value each agent receives is somewhat balanced.

3. **Execute the allocation:**
   - Assign items to agents based on maximizing each agent's individual satisfaction with their allocation while keeping envy minimal.

Let us allocate items accordingly:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: [3, 5]
  - Total value: 54 (Item 3) + 44 (Item 5) = 98

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: [1]
  - Total value: 57 (Item 1) = 57

- **Agent 2:**
  - Items: [0, 2]
  - Total value: 92 (Item 0) + 85 (Item 2) = 177

- **Agent 3:**
  - Items: [4]
  - Total value: 37 (Item 4) = 37

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items based on preferences while maintaining minimal envy among agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
