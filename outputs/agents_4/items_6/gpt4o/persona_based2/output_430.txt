Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  99  29  16  66  56
1  77  50  89  92  51  48
2  68  64  72  39  95  10
3   5   3  36  10  17   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the values each agent assigns to the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share. Considering the valuations provided, we'll aim to ensure that each agent feels their allocation is reasonable compared to others.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a high valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 highly, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 highly, so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Does not have high valuations compared to others, so we aim to give them items that are less valued by others. Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 as it has low value for others.
5. Remaining items 0 and 5 need to be allocated. Agent 1 also values item 0, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
6. Agent 0 values item 5 more than others, so allocate it to Agent 0.

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 2

This allocation aims to balance the distribution based on individual preferences and achieves a reasonable level of envy-freeness. Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
