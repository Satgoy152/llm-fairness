Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  30  36  77  73  43
1  20  18  74  84  57  19
2  13  66   7  55  99  16
3   3  10   0  50  73  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 30 36 77 73 43]
 [20 18 74 84 57 19]
 [13 66  7 55 99 16]
 [ 3 10  0 50 73 35]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation to the extent possible. Here, I will use a simple heuristic to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's utility for the items they receive.

We have the following valuations matrix for agents (rows) and items (columns):

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  30  36  77  73  43
1  20  18  74  84  57  19
2  13  66   7  55  99  16
3   3  10   0  50  73  35
```

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 53 by agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 66 by agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 74 by agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 84 by agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 99 by agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 43 by agent 0.

Let's review the allocations so far:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4
- Agent 3: No items

Agent 3 has not received any items yet. To ensure fairness, we can adjust the allocation slightly:

- Reallocate item 5 from agent 0 to agent 3, as it has the lowest impact on agent 0's overall value.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4
- Agent 3: Item 5

This ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and items are allocated based on maximizing valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
