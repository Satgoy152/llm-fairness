Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  32  70  19  37  76
1  30   5   0  33  51  52
2  73  29  62  31  61  89
3  79  11   7  78  61  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute them such that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation given their preferences.

One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives and ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** [94, 32, 70, 19, 37, 76]
   - Highest valuation: 94 (item 0)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** [30, 5, 0, 33, 51, 52]
   - Highest valuation: 52 (item 5)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** [73, 29, 62, 31, 61, 89]
   - Highest valuation: 89 (item 5), but item 5 is already taken, so next is 73 (item 0)

4. **Agent 3's Valuations:** [79, 11, 7, 78, 61, 54]
   - Highest valuation: 79 (item 0), but item 0 is already taken, next is 78 (item 3)

Now, let's assign items to maximize fairness:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valuation.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valuation.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as items 0 and 5 are taken, and 62 is the highest available for them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it is their second highest and available.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, to increase their total value.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3, as it maximizes their remaining value.

Now, let's compile the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This distribution aims to give each agent a set of items that they value highly, which should help in maintaining fairness and reducing envy among them.
