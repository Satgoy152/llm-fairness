Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  36  21  51   0  80
1  51  85  74  41  51  98
2  64  91  60  75  20  72
3  55  82  10  86  98  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 85 74 41 51 98]
 [64 91 60 75 20 72]
 [55 82 10 86 98 63]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while minimizing envy, we can utilize the concept of envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items that another agent receives over their own bundle. Given the table of valuations, we should aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent's perceived value of their own allocation is maximized relative to others.

Here are the valuations of each item by each agent:

```
Items:   0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent 0: 21  36  21  51   0  80
Agent 1: 51  85  74  41  51  98
Agent 2: 64  91  60  75  20  72
Agent 3: 55  82  10  86  98  63
```

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should consider the highest-value items for each agent and attempt to distribute them such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (value 98), so assign item 5 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (value 98), so assign item 4 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (value 91), so assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0** highly values item 5 (value 80) but it is already assigned to Agent 1. So, assign item 3 (value 51) to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 2** also values item 3 (value 75), but it is already assigned to Agent 0. So, the next best for Agent 2 is item 0 (value 64), assign item 0 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 3** also values item 1 (value 82), but it is already assigned to Agent 2. So, the next best for Agent 3 is item 3 (value 86), but it is already assigned. The next best available is item 2 (value 10), assign item 2 to Agent 3.

After following this process, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. This should ideally minimize envy among agents.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
