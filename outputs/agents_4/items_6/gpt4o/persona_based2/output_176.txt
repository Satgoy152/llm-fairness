Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  92  12  14  55  67
1  28  22  53  54  14  13
2  89  59  67  28  12  38
3  49   5  62  33  38  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent would have for different combinations of items and ensure that the distribution is as balanced as possible so that no agent envies another.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance the total valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has a higher preference for item 2 and item 3.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 very highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 quite high, but considering the distribution, they can be allocated item 4.

Proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 5]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 3]
- **Agent 2**: Item [1]
- **Agent 3**: Item [4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total valuation is fairly balanced given the preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
