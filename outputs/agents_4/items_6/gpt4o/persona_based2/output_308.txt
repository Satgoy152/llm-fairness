Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  52  65  73  35   2
1  35  56  88  75  40  47
2  46  27  62  37  41  85
3  95  62  86  90  78  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 56 88 75 40 47]
 [46 27 62 37 41 85]
 [95 62 86 90 78 14]]
Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we will attempt to achieve envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer the bundle of another agent over their own based on their valuations. Given the valuations, we can try to assign items in a way that minimizes envy and tries to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [0, 52, 65, 73, 35, 2]
Agent 1: [35, 56, 88, 75, 40, 47]
Agent 2: [46, 27, 62, 37, 41, 85]
Agent 3: [95, 62, 86, 90, 78, 14]
```

To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we can use a method such as the round-robin allocation where agents take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool. However, here we'll try to balance the total value to each agent by strategically allocating items:

1. **Item 3** (value 90) is most valued by Agent 3.
2. **Item 2** (value 88) is most valued by Agent 1.
3. **Item 5** (value 85) is most valued by Agent 2.
4. **Item 0** (value 95) is most valued by Agent 3, but we will assign it to Agent 0 to balance the value.
5. **Item 1** (value 56) is the next best for Agent 1.
6. **Item 4** (value 78) is valued by Agent 3, but to balance, it goes to Agent 2.

Now let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2, 1]
- Agent 2: [5, 4]
- Agent 3: [3]

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 95
- Agent 1: 88 + 56 = 144
- Agent 2: 85 + 41 = 126
- Agent 3: 90

Although not perfectly balanced, the allocation tries to distribute high-value items to each agent while considering their preferences.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation assigns all six items and attempts to minimize envy among agents based on their valuations.
