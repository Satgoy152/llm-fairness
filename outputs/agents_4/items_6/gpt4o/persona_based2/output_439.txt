Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  47  95  26   5   8
1  30  20  76  79   8  94
2  21  21  21  83   9  27
3   2  67   3  28  53  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 47 95 26  5  8]
 [30 20 76 79  8 94]
 [21 21 21 83  9 27]
 [ 2 67  3 28 53 48]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly while considering the valuations of each agent, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. However, since we have only integer allocations and each agent may value items differently, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible. Instead, we'll aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Given the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0: [96, 47, 95, 26, 5, 8]
- Agent 1: [30, 20, 76, 79, 8, 94]
- Agent 2: [21, 21, 21, 83, 9, 27]
- Agent 3: [2, 67, 3, 28, 53, 48]

First, we'll determine each agent's top-valued items and try to allocate these as fairly as possible:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 5.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 1.

To balance the allocation, we can proceed as follows:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (second highest value).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (second highest value).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (highest value).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has a relatively high value compared to others for the remaining items).

This allocation attempts to balance the overall value each agent receives based on their preferences. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with a focus on minimizing potential envy by giving agents some of their top-valued items.
