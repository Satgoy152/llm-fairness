Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  85  50   9  88  97
1  49  55  40  63  47  93
2  29  89  42  61  16  15
3  42  56  70  60  13  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar heuristic approaches. Here, we'll aim to balance the total value of items each agent receives based on their valuations to minimize envy.

Let's analyze the best way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (99) and item 5 second highest (97).
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest (93).
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest (89).
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the highest (70).

Based on these preferences, we can start by assigning each agent their most valued item where possible:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (99) and item 5 (97).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (63) and item 4 (47).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 (89).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 2 (70).

This allocation gives each agent a set of items with high valuations according to their preferences. It aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and a total of 6 items are allocated.
