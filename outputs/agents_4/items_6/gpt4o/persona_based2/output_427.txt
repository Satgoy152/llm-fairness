Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  60  16  96  72  32
1   1  74  64  40   9   6
2  48  96  16  36  53  30
3  26  27   3  71  87  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or at least minimize envy as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items another agent has over their own.

To solve this problem, we can use a method that distributes items based on agents' valuations, ensuring each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: 62, 60, 16, 96, 72, 32
   - Highest value item for Agent 0 is item 3 (value 96).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: 1, 74, 64, 40, 9, 6
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 1 (value 74).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: 48, 96, 16, 36, 53, 30
   - Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 1 (value 96), but it's already allocated to Agent 1. Next highest is item 0 (value 48).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: 26, 27, 3, 71, 87, 14
   - Highest value item for Agent 3 is item 4 (value 87).

After initially assigning the most valued items, we need to distribute the remaining items (0, 2, 5) in a manner that tries to maintain balance and minimize envy:

- Item 5 is given to Agent 0, as it has the second-highest value for them among the remaining items.
- Item 2 is given to Agent 1, as it is the highest value remaining and matches with their preference.
- Item 0 is given to Agent 2, as it was their next highest valued item.

The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's valuations and attempts to minimize envy by prioritizing high-value items and distributing remaining items to balance the allocations.
