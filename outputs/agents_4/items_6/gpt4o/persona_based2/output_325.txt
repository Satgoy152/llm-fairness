Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  97  91  10  55  76
1  24  86  99  67  43  89
2  65  30  45  60  18  30
3  43   7  77   5   2  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that aims to minimize envy, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences.

Let's go through the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values items highly, especially item 1 (97) and item 2 (91).
- Agent 1: Values item 2 (99) the most, followed by item 5 (89).
- Agent 2: Values item 0 (65) the most, followed by item 3 (60).
- Agent 3: Values item 5 (88) the most, followed by item 2 (77).

A strategy to minimize envy is to assign each agent their highest-valued items first, ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation significantly more than their own. Let's allocate the items:

1. **Allocate Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 99, so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.

2. **Allocate Item 5**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 88, so we assign item 5 to Agent 3.

3. **Allocate Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 97, so we assign item 1 to Agent 0.

4. **Allocate Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 65, so we assign item 0 to Agent 2.

5. **Allocate Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 67, which is relatively high for them, so we assign item 3 to Agent 1.

6. **Allocate Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 55, which is higher than the other agents. So, assign item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation should minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives at least some of the items they value. Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5]
}
```
