Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  23  49  90  25  22
1  74  79   1  90  75  68
2  31  87  29  54  12  94
3  33   5   5  91  61  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a distribution that reduces envy among agents, considering their valuations of each item. The goal is to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations for a potential envy-free allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** High valuation for item 3 (90).
2. **Agent 1:** High valuation for items 0 (74), 1 (79), and 3 (90).
3. **Agent 2:** High valuation for item 5 (94).
4. **Agent 3:** High valuation for item 5 (97).

Given these preferences, we will try to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one of their highly valued items, while also minimizing overall envy. 

A possible allocation is:

- **Agent 0:** Gets item 3 (value 90 for agent 0, and also a high value for agent 1).
- **Agent 1:** Gets items 0 and 1 (values 74 and 79 for agent 1).
- **Agent 2:** Gets item 5 (value 94 for agent 2).
- **Agent 3:** Gets items 2 and 4 (values 5 and 61 for agent 3).

This allocation aims to balance the high-value items among the agents, taking into account their preferences, and reducing the potential for envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the total number of items allocated is six, satisfying the conditions provided.
