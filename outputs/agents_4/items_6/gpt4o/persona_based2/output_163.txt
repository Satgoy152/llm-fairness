Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  94  68  73  52  26
1  73  94  19  64  93  88
2  35  40  58  42  42  67
3  64  67  42  72  79  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 94 68 73 52 26]
 [73 94 19 64 93 88]
 [35 40 58 42 42 67]
 [64 67 42 72 79 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their total valuation, given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

We can use a simple algorithmic approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Sum up the total valuation of items for each agent.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating the item with the highest value to each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
3. **Reallocation to Maximize Total Value**: Adjust allocations by swapping items among agents to maximize total satisfaction and reduce envy.

Here is the computation of total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 25 + 94 + 68 + 73 + 52 + 26 = 338
- Agent 1: 73 + 94 + 19 + 64 + 93 + 88 = 431
- Agent 2: 35 + 40 + 58 + 42 + 42 + 67 = 284
- Agent 3: 64 + 67 + 42 + 72 + 79 + 77 = 401

Based on these valuations and aiming to minimize envy, one feasible allocation could be:

- Agent 0 should receive items that maximize their total valuation while considering others: [1, 2]
- Agent 1, having the highest total valuation, should receive highly valued items: [0]
- Agent 2 should receive items they value highest within the remaining set: [5]
- Agent 3 should receive the remaining items they value highly: [3, 4]

This allocation is done considering that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on available valuations.

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
