Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  30  80  25  88  14
1  84   4  75  74  37  46
2  39  62  35  50  67  30
3  85   8  28  55   4  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 30 80 25 88 14]
 [84  4 75 74 37 46]
 [39 62 35 50 67 30]
 [85  8 28 55  4 81]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. We'll employ a simple heuristic method to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item Across All Agents:**
   - Item 0: \(13 + 84 + 39 + 85 = 221\)
   - Item 1: \(30 + 4 + 62 + 8 = 104\)
   - Item 2: \(80 + 75 + 35 + 28 = 218\)
   - Item 3: \(25 + 74 + 50 + 55 = 204\)
   - Item 4: \(88 + 37 + 67 + 4 = 196\)
   - Item 5: \(14 + 46 + 30 + 81 = 171\)

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - If multiple agents value an item equally or if an agent receives too many items, adjust the allocation by considering the next highest valuation.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 3 (85). Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 2 (62). Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 0 (80). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 1 (74). Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 0 (88). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 3 (81). Assign to Agent 3.

Thus, the initial allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 5]

Finally, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
