Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  32   3  89  66  39
1  23  40  97  85  65  28
2  49  75  32  72  32   4
3  48  97  16  23  39  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to maximize each agent's perceived value of the items they receive and minimize envy among agents. Given the constraints and the valuations, we will try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item they value highly.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent Preferences**: Identify the most valued items for each agent.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (89).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (97).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most (75).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (97), but since Agent 2 also highly values this, we'll consider second-highest for potential allocations.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate the most valued items to each agent if possible.
   - Give item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Give item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Give item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Balancing and Adjusting**:
   - Agent 3 highly values item 1 but it's already given to Agent 2, so we consider Agent 3's next most valued items which are item 5 (75) and item 0 (48).
   - Since item 5 is least valued by others, assign item 5 to Agent 3.
   - For balance, assign remaining items to ensure each agent gets their fair share and minimize envy.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 received item 3, consider giving them item 0 (9) as it is the least valued by others.
   - Agent 1 received item 2, consider giving them item 4 (65) which is moderately valued.
   - Agent 2 received item 1, they can also get item 4 (32) but since Agent 1 values it more, Agent 2 can receive item 3 (72) instead.
   - Agent 3 received item 5, and since they have an item already, their allocation is complete.

Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, each agent gets at least one of their higher-valued items, and the total number of items is 6.
