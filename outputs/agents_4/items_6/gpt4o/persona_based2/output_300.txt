Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  56  57  40  51  41
1  93  45  94   9  21  45
2  72  47  24  30  18   8
3  89  54  77  13  52  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among agents, we aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Here, a possible approach is to use an approximate envy-free allocation strategy like the "round-robin" method or "max-min" strategy. 

In this case, I will proceed with an allocation that aims to balance valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuations: Item 2 (57), Item 1 (56), Item 4 (51)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 0 (93), Item 2 (94)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 0 (72), Item 1 (47)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: Item 0 (89), Item 2 (77)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, and 5. We need to allocate the remaining items 3 and 4.

Re-evaluation for remaining items:
- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0: 40
  - Agent 1: 9
  - Agent 2: 30
  - Agent 3: 13
  - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0

- **Item 4**:
  - Agent 0: 51
  - Agent 1: 21
  - Agent 2: 18
  - Agent 3: 52
  - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the highest valuations among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
