Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  66  25  47  38  44
1  45   7  79   7  93  76
2  12  47  39  53  62   8
3  58   3  26   9  52  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58  3 26  9 52 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy and ensure some level of fairness, such as maximizing total valuations or ensuring proportionality. Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items accordingly.

Here are the values each agent has for each item:

- Agent 0: [16, 66, 25, 47, 38, 44]
- Agent 1: [45, 7, 79, 7, 93, 76]
- Agent 2: [12, 47, 39, 53, 62, 8]
- Agent 3: [58, 3, 26, 9, 52, 91]

To distribute these items in a fair manner, we can use a greedy approach, which involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Allocating step-by-step:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 3 values it the most (58).
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it the most (66).
3. **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it the most (79).
4. **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it the most (53).
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it the most (93), but we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item. We'll assign it to Agent 3, who values it next highest (52).
6. **Item 5:** Agent 3 values it the most (91), but we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item. We'll assign it to Agent 2, who has already received one item, but Agent 3 has a stronger claim with their high valuation (91).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to respect the highest valuations while distributing fairly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated while trying to maximize the agents' preferences based on their valuations.
