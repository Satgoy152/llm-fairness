Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  22  18  43  76  47
1  76  86  17   7  63  48
2  67  16   6   7  68   1
3  28  38  16  95  61  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 22 18 43 76 47]
 [76 86 17  7 63 48]
 [67 16  6  7 68  1]
 [28 38 16 95 61 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle based on their valuations.

Given the valuation matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  22  18  43  76  47
1  76  86  17   7  63  48
2  67  16   6   7  68   1
3  28  38  16  95  61  67
```

Let's evaluate the allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest (86), so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest (76), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest (95), so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 2** prefers item 0 (67), so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, there are two items left: 2 and 5. We will allocate these considering the remaining highest valuations:

5. **Agent 0** values item 5 next highest (47), so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 3** values item 2 next highest (16), so allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 2, 3

This ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest preferences and all items are allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
