Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  65  86  14  41  55
1  82  37  63  42  25  44
2   1  61  26  87  36  79
3  21  58  23  53  35  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 58 23 53 35 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate each of the 6 items such that no agent envies another based on the value they perceive.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [7, 65, 86, 14, 41, 55]
- Agent 1: [82, 37, 63, 42, 25, 44]
- Agent 2: [1, 61, 26, 87, 36, 79]
- Agent 3: [21, 58, 23, 53, 35, 33]

### Strategy for Allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent** and prioritize allocating based on these values while ensuring no two agents get the same item.

2. **Allocate items to maximize total satisfaction** by ensuring each agent gets at least one item they highly value, if possible.

3. **Ensure that the allocation is envy-free** where possible, meaning no agent should feel that another agent's allocation is better than theirs based on their own valuations.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: The highest valued items for Agent 0 are items 2 (86) and 1 (65). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
  
- **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 0 (82). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 3 (87). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

- **Agent 3**: The highest available value for Agent 3 after the above allocations is item 1 (58). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

- **Remaining Items**: Items 4 and 5 are left.

  - Assign item 5 (55) to Agent 0 as it has high value for them and complements their existing allocation.
  - Assign item 4 (36) to Agent 2 as it complements their allocation.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, and the distribution is designed to minimize envy among agents based on their valuations.
