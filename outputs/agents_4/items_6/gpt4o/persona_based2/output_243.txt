Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6   9  23  32  86  42
1  22  26   0  90  93  20
2  52  93  46  21  95  86
3  39  87  42  11  24  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with the goal of minimizing envy, we can use an algorithmic approach to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value, while trying to balance the overall distribution.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: \(6 + 9 + 23 + 32 + 86 + 42 = 198\)
   - Agent 1: \(22 + 26 + 0 + 90 + 93 + 20 = 251\)
   - Agent 2: \(52 + 93 + 46 + 21 + 95 + 86 = 393\)
   - Agent 3: \(39 + 87 + 42 + 11 + 24 + 99 = 302\)

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Individual Valuations:**
   - Assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (value 52)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (value 93)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (value 23)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (value 90)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (value 95)
   - Item 5: Agent 3 (value 99)

4. **Verify Fairness and Adjust if Necessary:**
   - Ensure no single agent has all items and that the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure that all items are allocated and no agent has more than they can reasonably justify based on their valuations.

Given this approach, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, while trying to maximize the value perceived by each agent for the items they receive.
