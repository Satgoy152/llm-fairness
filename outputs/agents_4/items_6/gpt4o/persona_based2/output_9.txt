Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  15  28  70  50  79
1  87  78  97  33  29  31
2   0  42  73  65  30  40
3  83  73  29  89  20  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 15 28 70 50 79]
 [87 78 97 33 29 31]
 [ 0 42 73 65 30 40]
 [83 73 29 89 20 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can try to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [53, 15, 28, 70, 50, 79]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [87, 78, 97, 33, 29, 31]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [0, 42, 73, 65, 30, 40]
- Agent 3 values items as follows: [83, 73, 29, 89, 20, 37]

A simple approach to achieve a fair division could be to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring all items are allocated:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 87.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 78.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 97.
4. Item 3: Agent 3 values it the highest at 89.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest at 50.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest at 79.

Now, let's allocate the items based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most, which should minimize envy as each agent gets their most valued items where possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation uses all 6 items and tries to minimize envy by prioritizing the highest valuations.
