Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  86  98  75  18   2
1  68  48  93  63  51  87
2  10  16  11  40   3  65
3  28  50  96  85  54  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent believes they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 6 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations and attempt to find such an allocation:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Agent 3 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 51      | 68      | 10      | 28      |
| 1    | 86      | 48      | 16      | 50      |
| 2    | 98      | 93      | 11      | 96      |
| 3    | 75      | 63      | 40      | 85      |
| 4    | 18      | 51      | 3       | 54      |
| 5    | 2       | 87      | 65      | 72      |

We can use the following approach to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most but since it's allocated to Agent 1, we try to ensure they get item 3 that they value relatively higher than other items they can get.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the most, but since it's allocated to Agent 0, we try to ensure they get item 3 that they value the second most.

Based on the valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item 2 (value 98)
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 5 (value 87)
- **Agent 2**: Gets item 3 (value 40)
- **Agent 3**: Gets items 1 and 4 (values 50 and 54)

Now we have allocated 5 items. Let's allocate the remaining item 0:

- **Agent 1** can also receive item 0 (value 68), as they value it more than others.

Thus, the allocation will be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and considers their valuations to minimize envy.
