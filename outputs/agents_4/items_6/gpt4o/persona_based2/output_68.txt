Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  25  78  85  32  85
1   2  95  87  37  62  32
2  90  68  13  35  66  12
3  11  41  66  66  75  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 95 87 37 62 32]

 [11 41 66 66 75 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility while ensuring the distribution is envy-free, if possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations for optimal allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Prefers items with high value: 2 (78), 3 (85), 5 (85)
- **Agent 1**: Prefers items: 1 (95), 2 (87)
- **Agent 2**: Prefers items: 0 (90)
- **Agent 3**: Prefers items: 4 (75)

We aim to allocate these items such that each agent is satisfied with what they receive. Below is a proposed allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Receives items 2 and 5. Total value = 78 + 85 = 163
- **Agent 1**: Receives item 1. Total value = 95
- **Agent 2**: Receives item 0. Total value = 90
- **Agent 3**: Receives items 3 and 4. Total value = 66 + 75 = 141

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they highly value, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
