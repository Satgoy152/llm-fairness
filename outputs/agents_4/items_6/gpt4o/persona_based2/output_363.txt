Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91   8   7  93  65  43
1  47  35  14  75  45  62
2  59  86  65  93   9  85
3  45  71  29  98  19  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we'll aim to find an allocation where each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as the bundles received by others, if possible. Given the complexity of ensuring strict envy-freeness with integer items, we'll aim for a balanced allocation based on the given valuations.

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has a high preference for items 0 and 3. Allocating these high-value items to Agent 0 can maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 relatively highly compared to other items. Allocating item 5 to Agent 1 can be beneficial for them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 and item 2 quite highly. Allocating these items to Agent 2 can improve their satisfaction.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly compared to other items. Allocating item 4 to Agent 3 can maximize their satisfaction.

Allocating items based on the above analysis, we can achieve a reasonably fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 3]
- **Agent 1**: Item [5]
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2]
- **Agent 3**: Item [4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value relatively highly, thereby reducing envy and increasing overall fairness given the constraint of integer allocations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 6 items to the agents, satisfying the requirement of allocating all items and ensuring each agent receives at least one item of significant value to them.
