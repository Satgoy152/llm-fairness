Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  49  12  14  42  91
1  65  87  96  88   8   8
2   7  83  40  12  73  50
3  64   5  25  24  20   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a set of items that they value highly, while ensuring that no agent envies another agentâ€™s allocation. This is a combinatorial optimization problem, and one way to approach it is to attempt to maximize the minimum satisfaction or minimize envy among agents.

Let's examine the valuations provided and allocate the items:

**Agent 0:**
- Values: [26, 49, 12, 14, 42, 91]

**Agent 1:**
- Values: [65, 87, 96, 88, 8, 8]

**Agent 2:**
- Values: [7, 83, 40, 12, 73, 50]

**Agent 3:**
- Values: [64, 5, 25, 24, 20, 1]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Each agent should get at least one item, considering the maximum value they place on any item.
2. Items should be allocated to maximize the minimum value for each agent or minimize the difference in satisfaction.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 5 the highest at 91.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest at 96.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest at 73.
- **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest at 64.

After allocating each agent their highest valued item, we will allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 1** also values item 3 highly at 88, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** can take item 1, which they value at 49.
- **Agent 2** can take item 5, which they value at 50 (though this was initially given to Agent 0, we need to adjust or swap some allocations).

### Final Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: [1]
- **Agent 1**: [2, 3]
- **Agent 2**: [4]
- **Agent 3**: [0]

Agent 0 and Agent 2 require an additional item each to ensure all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0** additionally gets item 5 (as 91 is the highest value they have, it can be swapped with Agent 2's item 4 or 5).
- **Agent 2** keeps item 4, and we swap item 5 with Agent 0.

This results in:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value significantly and minimizes envy as much as possible given the constraints of integer allocations.
