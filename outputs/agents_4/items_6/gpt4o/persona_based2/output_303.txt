Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  94   0  50  54  69
1  65  58  13  73  51   8
2  13  18  46  13  66  51
3   7  95   5   4  58  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 6 items to the 4 agents in a way that is as fair as possible. One common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle.

First, let's consider the valuations given by each agent for the items:

- Agent 0: [0, 94, 0, 50, 54, 69]
- Agent 1: [65, 58, 13, 73, 51, 8]
- Agent 2: [13, 18, 46, 13, 66, 51]
- Agent 3: [7, 95, 5, 4, 58, 91]

One strategy is to use a round-robin method where each agent selects their most valued item that is still available. This can help ensure that each agent gets at least one item they value highly.

### Allocation Process:

1. **First Round:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 1 (value 94).
   - Agent 1 selects item 3 (value 73).
   - Agent 2 selects item 4 (value 66).
   - Agent 3 selects item 5 (value 91).

2. **Second Round:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 0 (value 0, remaining choices have no value).
   - Agent 1 selects item 2 (value 13, highest remaining value).
   - Agent 2 and Agent 3 will not select any additional items as only item 0 is left, which they do not value.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: [1, 0]
- Agent 1: [3, 2]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [5]

These allocations give each agent a reasonably fair distribution based on their preferences, respecting the constraints of the problem.

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and no agent receives more items than they value highly, which provides a balance in the perceived fairness from the perspective of each agent's valuations.
