Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57   1  91  62  12  44
1  29  48  70  51   5  77
2  90  94  61  18  57  31
3  47  74  55  99  93  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent receives a set of items that reflects a balance in their perceived value. The goal is to minimize envy, ensuring each agent feels that they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [57, 1, 91, 62, 12, 44]
- Agent 1: [29, 48, 70, 51, 5, 77]
- Agent 2: [90, 94, 61, 18, 57, 31]
- Agent 3: [47, 74, 55, 99, 93, 89]

We need to allocate 6 items among 4 agents. Each agent should get at least one item, and the allocation should be envy-free as much as possible.

To achieve this, let's assign each item to the agent who values it the most. We'll ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and try to balance the distribution of total value.

1. Item 0: Highest value is for Agent 2 (90)
2. Item 1: Highest value is for Agent 2 (94)
3. Item 2: Highest value is for Agent 0 (91)
4. Item 3: Highest value is for Agent 3 (99)
5. Item 4: Highest value is for Agent 3 (93)
6. Item 5: Highest value is for Agent 1 (77)

After this initial allocation, we need to ensure each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: Items 3, 4

Since Agents 3 and 2 have more items, let's adjust to ensure fairness:

Reallocate items so each agent gets at least one:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (high value for Agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (high value for Agent 1)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (high value for Agent 2)
- Agent 3: Items 3 (highest value item for Agent 3)

Now, we have two items left (Items 1 and 4) which we need to distribute, balancing the overall value:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation)

This results in the allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [0, 1]
- Agent 3: [3, 4]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
