Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  88  38   0  77  78
1  88   6  85  52  97  50
2  89  27  42  34  29  55
3  46  60  72  12  46  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
The task is to allocate the 6 items to the 4 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible. One common criterion for fairness is envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the agents' valuations for each item:

- **Agent 0**: [55, 88, 38, 0, 77, 78]
- **Agent 1**: [88, 6, 85, 52, 97, 50]
- **Agent 2**: [89, 27, 42, 34, 29, 55]
- **Agent 3**: [46, 60, 72, 12, 46, 78]

A possible allocation approach is to assign each agent the item they value most, then adjust to ensure all items are allocated.

1. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (88).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (97).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most (89).
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the most (78).

2. **Resolve Conflicts and Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0.
   - Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 1.
   - Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2.
   - Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 3.
   - Assign remaining items 2 and 3 to agents with lower allocations or who can accept them to maintain fairness.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [1, 2]
   - Agent 1: [4]
   - Agent 2: [0]
   - Agent 3: [5, 3]

This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one of their high-value items and ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```
