Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  62  77  71  28  55
1  34  51  59  69  94  40
2  63  59   9  78  66  19
3   0   4  19  86  26  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 62 77 71 28 55]
 [34 51 59 69 94 40]
 [63 59  9 78 66 19]
 [ 0  4 19 86 26 69]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent gets a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [78, 62, 77, 71, 28, 55]
Agent 1: [34, 51, 59, 69, 94, 40]
Agent 2: [63, 59, 9, 78, 66, 19]
Agent 3: [0, 4, 19, 86, 26, 69]
```

We'll evaluate the highest valuations for each item to try and achieve a fair distribution that minimizes envy.

### Strategy for Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 78.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 62.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 77.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values this item the highest at 86.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 94.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values this item the highest at 69.

### Allocation:

- Assign Items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 0 as they have the highest valuation for these items.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 since they have the highest valuation.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 since they have the highest valuation.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 3, who values it highly after Agent 0.

Let's confirm that this allocation is feasible and fair given the constraints:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [3, 5]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets an integer number of items. It is based on each agent's highest valuation for the items they receive, minimizing envy.

Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
