Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  80   7  14   0  30
1  77  22  73   3  91  71
2  25  24  87  66   5  63
3  34  17  49  22   5  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent to their own, based on their individual valuations.

### Step 1: Calculate total valuations for each agent

First, let's summarize each agent's total valuation of all items to understand their preferences:

- Agent 0: 31 + 80 + 7 + 14 + 0 + 30 = 162
- Agent 1: 77 + 22 + 73 + 3 + 91 + 71 = 337
- Agent 2: 25 + 24 + 87 + 66 + 5 + 63 = 270
- Agent 3: 34 + 17 + 49 + 22 + 5 + 36 = 163

### Step 2: Initial allocation attempt

We aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will try to allocate high-value items to each agent first, proceeding with trial and error to balance the distribution.

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 (80) and 0 (31). We allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (91) and item 0 (77) highly. We allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 2 (87) highly. We allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** values item 0 (34) highly but Agent 1 already values it more and has not been allocated yet. We allocate item 3 (22) to Agent 3.

### Step 3: Re-evaluate and adjust allocations

5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for it after initial allocations.

6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for it.

### Step 4: Finalize the allocation

The allocations are made to ensure each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6. The results are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value reasonably highly, aiming to balance satisfaction across all agents.
