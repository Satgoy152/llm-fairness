Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  54  88  21  95  35
1  31  65  89  11  77  30
2  60   9   6  72  16  81
3  16  55  47  22   2  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 65 89 11 77 30]
 [60  9  6 72 16 81]
 [16 55 47 22  2 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents in a way that considers their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness. This means that each agent should feel that their allocated items are at least as valuable as the items allocated to any other agent, given their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Items by Agents:**  
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   \text{Agent 0:} & \quad 30 + 54 + 88 + 21 + 95 + 35 = 323 \\
   \text{Agent 1:} & \quad 31 + 65 + 89 + 11 + 77 + 30 = 303 \\
   \text{Agent 2:} & \quad 60 + 9 + 6 + 72 + 16 + 81 = 244 \\
   \text{Agent 3:} & \quad 16 + 55 + 47 + 22 + 2 + 96 = 238 \\
   \end{align*}
   \]

2. **Initial Heuristic for Assignment:**  
   Each agent should ideally get items summing up to their fair share of the total valuation. However, the primary goal here is to avoid envy.

3. **Assign the Most Valued Items First:**  
   We can start by assigning each agent their most valued item and then proceed to assign remaining items based on maximizing the fairness.

   - **Agent 0:** Values item 4 the highest (95).
   - **Agent 1:** Values item 2 the highest (89).
   - **Agent 2:** Values item 5 the highest (81).
   - **Agent 3:** Values item 5 the highest (96), but since it's already taken, we look at the next highest which is item 1 (55).

4. **Adjust for Remaining Items:**  
   After assigning the most valued items, we continue to allocate remaining items while ensuring fairness.

   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (next highest value after item 1).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value remaining and not causing envy).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest preference for Agent 1).

5. **Final Allocation:**  
   After performing these assignments, ensure that all items are allocated without leaving any agent envious of another.

6. **Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy and keeping the distribution fair according to their preferences.
