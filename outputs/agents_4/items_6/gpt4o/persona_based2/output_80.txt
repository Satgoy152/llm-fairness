Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  87  96  34  87   5
1  76  65  18  95  60  87
2  23  85  80   7  15  88
3  62  77  78  26  89  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to analyze the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values Item 2, and also values Items 0 and 1 significantly. 
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for Item 3, and also values Item 5.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for Item 5, but since Agent 1 also values it significantly, we will need to balance this. Agent 2 also values Item 1 highly.
4. **Agent 3** values Item 4 the most, and has a relatively high valuation for Item 1, but not as high as Agent 2.

Given these observations, let's assign the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2
- **Agent 1**: Item 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 4

This allocation minimizes envy by ensuring that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, and no agent can improve their situation by taking another agent's allocated item without decreasing their total value.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, every agent gets items, and the sum of items distributed is exactly 6, which satisfies the problem's constraints.
