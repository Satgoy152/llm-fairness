Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  49  91  14  75  10
1  63  49  24  10  54  58
2  58  84  96  70  39   0
3  49  74  55  97  69   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of items of another agent over their own.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**  
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (value 91)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (value 63)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (value 96)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 (value 97)

2. **Prioritize allocating high-value items if they do not cause envy:**  
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 2, so allocate it to Agent 2.
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 3, so allocate it to Agent 3.
   - Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 1, so allocate it to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items to minimize envy:**  
   - Remaining items: 1, 4, 5
   - Agent 0: Highest remaining value is for item 4 (value 75).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Next highest value after item 0 is item 5 (value 58).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 3: Next highest value after item 3 is item 1 (value 74).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated all items, and each agent has items that they value highly.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```
