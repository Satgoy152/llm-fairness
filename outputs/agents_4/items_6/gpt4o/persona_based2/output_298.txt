Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  35   4  65  63  82
1  53  15  84  21  39  89
2  26  76  30  13  62  17
3  15  95  82  34  90  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 15 84 21 39 89]
 [26 76 30 13 62 17]
 [15 95 82 34 90 71]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can use principles such as maximizing total valuation and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations, we need to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: 61 + 35 + 4 + 65 + 63 + 82 = 310
   - Agent 1: 53 + 15 + 84 + 21 + 39 + 89 = 301
   - Agent 2: 26 + 76 + 30 + 13 + 62 + 17 = 224
   - Agent 3: 15 + 95 + 82 + 34 + 90 + 71 = 387

2. **Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it highest at 61.
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it highest at 95.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest at 84.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it highest at 65.
   - Item 4: Agent 3 values it highest at 90.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it highest at 89.

3. **Check the distribution for any potential envy:**
   - Each agent receives items for which they have high valuations, reducing potential envy.

4. **Finalize the allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 5]
   - Agent 2: No items
   - Agent 3: Items [1, 4]

This distribution tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent has an opportunity to get desirable items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
