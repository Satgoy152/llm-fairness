Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  16  63  25  55   8
1  25  22   1  74  89  73
2  26  95  26  16  81  41
3  29  99  23  59  58  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 22  1 74 89 73]
 [26 95 26 16 81 41]
 [29 99 23 59 58 57]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to find an envy-free or a relatively fair division. This means we want each agent to be as satisfied as possible with their allocation relative to the others. Given the table, we can use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or a heuristic to assign items to minimize envy and maximize fairness.

We will analyze the valuations and allocate the items to the agents based on their preferences:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: The highest value is for item 0 (77) and item 2 (63).
2. **Agent 1's Preferences**: The highest values are for items 4 (89) and 3 (74).
3. **Agent 2's Preferences**: The highest value is for item 1 (95).
4. **Agent 3's Preferences**: The highest value is for item 1 (99), but since item 1 is already preferred by agent 2 who values it highly, agent 3 can have the next highest value item which is item 3 (59) or item 5 (57).

Let's allocate items to agents:

- **Agent 0**: We allocate items 0 (77) and 2 (63).
- **Agent 1**: We allocate item 4 (89).
- **Agent 2**: We allocate item 1 (95).
- **Agent 3**: We allocate items 3 (59) and 5 (57).

Each agent gets at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation seeks to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences, while ensuring that all items are allocated.
