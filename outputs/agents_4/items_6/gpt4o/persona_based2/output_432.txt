Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  70  84  25  79  65
1   2  60  20   6  37  53
2  28  49  91  37  21  79
3   6   1  14  10  15  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 60 20  6 37 53]
 [28 49 91 37 21 79]
 [ 6  1 14 10 15 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free division. An envy-free allocation means that each agent believes they have received a bundle of items at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle from their perspective.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [34, 70, 84, 25, 79, 65]
- Agent 1 values: [2, 60, 20, 6, 37, 53]
- Agent 2 values: [28, 49, 91, 37, 21, 79]
- Agent 3 values: [6, 1, 14, 10, 15, 51]

The goal is to distribute the 6 items among these 4 agents while maintaining the envy-freeness criterion.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0:** Values item 2 (84) the most. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 1 (60) the most. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** With item 2 taken, values item 5 (79) the next highest. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** With no high-value options left, item 3 (10) is the highest. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Remaining items: 0, 4

5. **Agent 0:** Values item 4 (79) highly. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 2:** With item 5 assigned, values item 0 (28) the next highest. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives items 5 and 0.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly, reducing potential envy.
