Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  41  94  48  26  47
1  25  94  42   5  44  48
2  33  85  84   2  97  60
3  39  33  98  50  59  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, meaning that each agent should feel that their bundle is at least as good as any other agent's bundle given their valuations.

Here are the agents' valuations for each item:
- Agent 0: [57, 41, 94, 48, 26, 47]
- Agent 1: [25, 94, 42, 5, 44, 48]
- Agent 2: [33, 85, 84, 2, 97, 60]
- Agent 3: [39, 33, 98, 50, 59, 73]

To achieve a fair allocation, we must consider each agent's preference for the items and try to distribute them in such a way that each agent perceives their allocation to be fair.

Step-by-step allocation:
1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Each agent should ideally get 1-2 items since there are 6 items and 4 agents.
   - Focus on high valuation matches initially to reduce potential envy.

2. **Allocate the High-Value Items**:
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the most (98). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (94). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (97). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
   
3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 has high value for item 0 (57) and item 3 (48). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 3 values item 5 highly (73), assign item 5 to Agent 3.
   - The remaining item 3 is valued by Agent 0 (48), assign item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation tries to respect the individual preferences based on the highest available value for each agent while distributing the items.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

Each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuation, and all items are allocated.
