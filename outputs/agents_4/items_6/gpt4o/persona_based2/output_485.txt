Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87   8  77  36  87  68
1   3  80   8  34  26  50
2  15  31  68  56  73  58
3  93  45  24  74  56  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87  8 77 36 87 68]
 [ 3 80  8 34 26 50]
 [15 31 68 56 73 58]
 [93 45 24 74 56 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or as close to it as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [87, 8, 77, 36, 87, 68]
Agent 1: [3, 80, 8, 34, 26, 50]
Agent 2: [15, 31, 68, 56, 73, 58]
Agent 3: [93, 45, 24, 74, 56, 46]
```

We need to consider each agent's preferences and allocate the items to minimize envy.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 4 equally (87). Let's assign item 0 to Agent 0 since item 4 could be more valuable to others.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (80). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (73). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (93), but since it is already assigned, the next highest is item 3 (74). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now we have items 2 and 5 left. Let's distribute them to minimize envy:
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it highly (77), and it's one of the remaining items that maximizes their utility. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it more than other remaining options (50). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: Item [3]

This allocation tries to respect the highest preferences of each agent and distribute items fairly based on the given valuations.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
