Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  57  91  77  54  32
1  15  55  73  98  84  71
2   6  30  55  16  95  54
3  84  43  57  62  56  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents based on the given valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations and consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly (91) and item 3 (77).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuation for item 3 (98) and item 4 (84).
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 highly (95).
4. **Agent 3** has high valuation for item 0 (84).

Based on these observations, let's propose an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: We allocate items [2, 3] to Agent 0. These items have high valuations of 91 and 77, respectively, for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: We allocate item [4] to Agent 1. This item has a high valuation of 84, and Agent 1 also values it highly.
- **Agent 2**: We allocate items [5] to Agent 2. Although not the highest, item 5 has a decent valuation for Agent 2 (54).
- **Agent 3**: We allocate items [0, 1] to Agent 3. Agent 3 values item 0 highly (84), and item 1 (43) is reasonable for them as well.

This allocation attempts to prioritize high-value items for agents who value them the most, aiming for an envy-free distribution.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.
