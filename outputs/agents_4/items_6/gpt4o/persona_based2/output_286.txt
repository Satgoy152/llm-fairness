Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  85  60  87  58   7
1  72  18  84  19  55  76
2  97   4  45  88  20  11
3   6  68  66  48  94  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness implies that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

To find a fair allocation, we can apply the following heuristic approach:

1. Calculate each agent's total valuation for all the items.
2. Allocate items to agents to maximize their total valuation while considering envy-freeness.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 75 + 85 + 60 + 87 + 58 + 7 = 372
- Agent 1: 72 + 18 + 84 + 19 + 55 + 76 = 324
- Agent 2: 97 + 4 + 45 + 88 + 20 + 11 = 265
- Agent 3: 6 + 68 + 66 + 48 + 94 + 80 = 362

With these total valuations in mind, let's allocate items in a way that tries to balance the perceived value among agents:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, who values it highest at 97.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, who values it highest at 85.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, who values it highest at 84.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, who values it highest at 88.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3, who values it highest at 94.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 3, who values it second highest at 80.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [0, 3]
- Agent 3: [4, 5]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
