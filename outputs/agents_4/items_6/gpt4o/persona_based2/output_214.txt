Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41   4  50  81  57  93
1  90   7  52  54  61  23
2  98  57  24  79  77  79
3  40  88  28  78  95  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To find a fair allocation of the items to the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that tries to minimize envy among agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations, we can use the following strategy for allocation:

1. Sum up the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items in a way that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly compared to others.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 41 + 4 + 50 + 81 + 57 + 93 = 326
- Agent 1: 90 + 7 + 52 + 54 + 61 + 23 = 287
- Agent 2: 98 + 57 + 24 + 79 + 77 + 79 = 414
- Agent 3: 40 + 88 + 28 + 78 + 95 + 44 = 373

Next, we try to allocate the items to each agent to maximize their total received valuation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest total valuation, so we prioritize them with items they value highly:
   - Items 0 (98), 5 (79)

2. **Agent 3** has the second-highest total valuation:
   - Items 1 (88), 4 (95)

3. **Agent 0** has the third-highest total valuation:
   - Item 3 (81)

4. **Agent 1** gets the remaining item:
   - Item 2 (52)

Let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3] = Total value = 81
- Agent 1: Items [2] = Total value = 52
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5] = Total value = 177
- Agent 3: Items [1, 4] = Total value = 183

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed in a manner that reflects the agents' valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
