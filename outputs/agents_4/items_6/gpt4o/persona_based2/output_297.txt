Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  63  73  74  49  19
1  86  48   2  52  17  11
2  70  58  13  91  52  75
3  64  17  30  34  94  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [70 58 13 91 52 75]
 [64 17 30 34 94 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their preferences. The goal is to allocate all 6 items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total allocation is exactly 6 items.

Let's evaluate the valuations and attempt to distribute the items:

### Valuations Table
- **Agent 0**: Values are [93, 63, 73, 74, 49, 19]
- **Agent 1**: Values are [86, 48, 2, 52, 17, 11]
- **Agent 2**: Values are [70, 58, 13, 91, 52, 75]
- **Agent 3**: Values are [64, 17, 30, 34, 94, 18]

### Strategy for Allocation
1. **Agent 0** has a strong preference for item 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 highly as well, but since Agent 0's preference is higher, we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 2** values item 3 highly, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 0** values item 2 and 1 quite high, giving item 2 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 2** values item 5 highly, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations
After considering these preferences and ensuring that all items are allocated, we arrive at the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2, Agent 1 receives no items, Agent 2 receives items 3 and 5, and Agent 3 receives item 4. This allocation attempts to respect the highest preferences of the agents while ensuring that all items are distributed.
