Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  73  94  11  93  84
1  57  38  49  58  54  44
2   3  60  94  95  14  80
3  43  28  41  52  51  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the constraints and the valuations, one approach is to use the concept of the maximum marginal utility, where items are allocated to agents who value them the most at each step.

Here's how the allocation process might proceed:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 51.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 73.
3. **Item 2**: Agents 0 and 2 both value it at 94. To ensure fair distribution, we allocate it to Agent 2 who has fewer items.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 95.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 93.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 84. However, to balance the allocations, we consider Agent 3 who values it at 75.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences while maintaining envy-freeness as much as possible given the integer allocation constraint.

Here is the resulting allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives the items they value the most, while Agents 2 and 3 also receive items they value highly. Agent 1 unfortunately doesn't receive any items, but given their relatively lower valuations, this allocation minimizes overall envy and maintains fairness.
