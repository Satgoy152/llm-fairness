Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  29  49  30  74  76
1  97  47  65  51   5  17
2  43  88  21   0  55  76
3  88   0  40  55  11   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can employ a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible given the constraint that each item must be assigned to exactly one agent.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **List each agent's valuation for each item**:
   - Agent 0: [64, 29, 49, 30, 74, 76]
   - Agent 1: [97, 47, 65, 51, 5, 17]
   - Agent 2: [43, 88, 21, 0, 55, 76]
   - Agent 3: [88, 0, 40, 55, 11, 2]

2. **Identify potential allocations**:
   - We will try to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to the items, while ensuring no two agents get the same item.

3. **Initial allocation based on highest preference**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (97), so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (88), so assign item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (76), so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (55), so assign item 3 to Agent 3.

4. **Allocate remaining items considering next best preferences**:
   - The remaining items are 2 and 4.
   - Agent 0's next highest preference is item 4 (74), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 3's next highest preference among remaining items is item 2 (40), so assign item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Ensure all items are allocated**:
   - We've allocated all 6 items, and each agent has received their top or next best available preference.

Finally, we present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences and ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents.
