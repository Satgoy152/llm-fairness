Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  92  95  43  26  82
1  73  17  16  90   2   4
2  64   0  11  47  37  73
3  64  98  24  11  43  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 92 95 43 26 82]
 [73 17 16 90  2  4]
 [64  0 11 47 37 73]
 [64 98 24 11 43 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should take into account the preferences and valuations of each agent for each item and try to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [91, 92, 95, 43, 26, 82]
Agent 1: [73, 17, 16, 90,  2,  4]
Agent 2: [64,  0, 11, 47, 37, 73]
Agent 3: [64, 98, 24, 11, 43, 77]
```

Let's aim for an allocation where each agent's total valuation is balanced, and agents do not envy the allocations of others. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Preferences**: Each agent should ideally receive items they value highly. For example, Agent 0 highly values item 2, and Agent 3 highly values item 1.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**:

    - **Agent 0**: Item 2 (value 95)
    - **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 90)
    - **Agent 2**: Item 5 (value 73)
    - **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value 98)

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:

   - Remaining items are 0 and 4. Let's allocate these to balance the valuations and minimize envy:
   
   - **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 91)
   - **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value 37)

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible by balancing the total valuation each agent receives, given their preferences for the items.
