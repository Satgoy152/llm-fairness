Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  10   4  99  63  84
1  36  52  79  85  10  32
2  48  83  26  24  37  33
3  93  44  34  32  67  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness (where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations), we can use a method such as the "round-robin" or the "sequential allocation" method. Let's proceed with the round-robin method for this allocation:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (99), so they choose item 3.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (79), so they choose item 2.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (83), so they choose item 1.
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 (93), so they choose item 0.

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0's next highest valuation is item 5 (84), so they choose item 5.
   - Agent 1's next highest valuation is item 4 (10), so they choose item 4.
   - All items are now allocated.

This allocation ensures that each agent selects an item based on their highest remaining valuation, promoting fairness in the distribution. Here's how the allocation looks:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```
