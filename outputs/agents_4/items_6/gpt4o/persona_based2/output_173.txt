Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8   7  82  93  12  22
1  49  69   1   2   3  89
2  49  57  84  53  32  77
3  91  88  29  10  68   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8  7 82 93 12 22]
 [49 69  1  2  3 89]
 [49 57 84 53 32 77]
 [91 88 29 10 68  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations table, we need to distribute the six items such that each agent's perceived value is maximized for their assigned items.

Let's analyze each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items accordingly:

- **Agent 0's valuations**: [8, 7, 82, 93, 12, 22]
- **Agent 1's valuations**: [49, 69, 1, 2, 3, 89]
- **Agent 2's valuations**: [49, 57, 84, 53, 32, 77]
- **Agent 3's valuations**: [91, 88, 29, 10, 68, 5]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 3** has the highest value of 93 for Agent 0. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0** has the highest value of 91 for Agent 3. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
3. **Item 1** has the highest value of 88 for Agent 3, but since Agent 3 has already received item 0, consider Agent 1 who values it at 69. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 2** is valued highest by Agent 2 at 84. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 5** is valued at 89 by Agent 1. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 4** has a relatively high value of 68 for Agent 3. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 5
- **Agent 2**: Item 2
- **Agent 3**: Items 0, 4

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences while ensuring each of the six items is distributed.
