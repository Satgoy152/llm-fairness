Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  36  70  64  31  77
1  64  49  75  93  35  10
2  48  62  50  11  73  97
3   7  96  44  89  51  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 49 75 93 35 10]
 [48 62 50 11 73 97]
 [ 7 96 44 89 51 43]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the 4 agents, we aim for an envy-free solution where each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their utility based on their valuations. We need to ensure that all 6 items are allocated and that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the valuations, we try to allocate items such that:
- Each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value.
- The allocation aims to minimize envy among agents.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [75, 36, 70, 64, 31, 77]
Agent 1: [64, 49, 75, 93, 35, 10]
Agent 2: [48, 62, 50, 11, 73, 97]
Agent 3: [7, 96, 44, 89, 51, 43]
```

A possible approach is to allocate the highest valued item to each agent first and then proceed with the remaining items:

1. **Assigning Highest Valued Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (77).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (93).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the highest but it has been taken, so we look at the next highest, item 4 (73).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (96).

2. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items left: 0, 2
   - Agent 0 has the next highest value for item 0 (75).
   - Agent 1 has the next highest value for item 2 (75).

Now, let's allocate the items based on this:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 5].
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 3].
- Agent 2 receives item [4].
- Agent 3 receives item [1].

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets items maximizing their individual utility.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
