Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  57  80  16  20  81
1  18  95  71  91  35  95
2  86  86  70  47  45  27
3  66  71  25  46  79  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 57 80 16 20 81]
 [18 95 71 91 35 95]
 [86 86 70 47 45 27]
 [66 71 25 46 79 80]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while attempting to minimize envy, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which maximizes the product of the utilities each agent receives. This approach often leads to a fair and efficient allocation of resources.

Let's calculate the MNW allocation:

1. Compute the utility each agent derives from each item, and consider possible allocations.
2. Allocate items such that the product of utilities is maximized.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 81)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (value 95) and Item 3 (value 91)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (value 86) and Item 2 (value 70)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (value 79)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and attempts to balance the total utility each agent receives.

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items among the 4 agents, aiming to maintain fairness and minimize envy.
