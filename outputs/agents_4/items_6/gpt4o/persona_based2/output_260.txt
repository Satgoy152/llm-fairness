Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  97  14   4  95  58
1  82  16  91  68  33  40
2  27  60  66  53  47  65
3  73  33   6  49  46  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 97 14  4 95 58]
 [82 16 91 68 33 40]
 [27 60 66 53 47 65]
 [73 33  6 49 46 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy and try to make each agent as satisfied as possible. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that any envy an agent may feel towards another agent can be eliminated by the removal of at most one item from the envied agentâ€™s bundle.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [93, 97, 14, 4, 95, 58]
Agent 1: [82, 16, 91, 68, 33, 40]
Agent 2: [27, 60, 66, 53, 47, 65]
Agent 3: [73, 33, 6, 49, 46, 75]
```

Let's try to allocate the items in a way that is balanced:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 1, and 4. Let's allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has a balanced preference over several items but values item 5 the most. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most, but since it's already allocated, we should prioritize other items they value like item 3. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated four items and still have items 1 and 3 to be allocated. Let's continue:
- For item 1, Agent 0 values it the most, but since they already have a fair allocation, let's consider Agent 2 who values it second-most among available items.
- For item 3, since Agent 3 already has an item, we can allocate it to Agent 1 as they have a reasonable valuation and currently only one item.

Thus, the proposed allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Item [5]

This allocation aims to minimize envy and provide a balanced distribution of items among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5]
}
```
