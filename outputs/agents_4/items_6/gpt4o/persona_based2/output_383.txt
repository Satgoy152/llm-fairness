Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  66  58   9  71   7
1  59  51  51  18   6  89
2  18  99  56  40  12  42
3   1  51  51  62  62   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items to the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes each agent's valuation of the items they receive. One common approach to achieve this is the Envy-Free Allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for items 1 (66) and 4 (71). Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 5 (89). Assign this item to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 1 (99), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 2 (56). Assign this item to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuations are equal for items 3 and 4 (62 each). However, item 4 is already assigned. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

This leaves items 0 and 2 unallocated. We need to distribute these remaining items in a way that continues to minimize envy:

- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (59) has a relatively high valuation for Agent 1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (51) has the same valuation for Agent 3 as Agent 1, but Agent 3 needs another item to ensure all items are allocated. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, all items are allocated, and the distribution attempts to minimize envy:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and no items are left unallocated.
