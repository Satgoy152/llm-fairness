Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  69  48  97  74   4
1  18  17   8  22  41  26
2  53  65  47  40  74   3
3  94  95  24  52  72  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 65 47 40 74  3]
 [94 95 24 52 72 66]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the Envy-Free Matching algorithm or other fair division techniques. Given that there are 6 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive at least 1 item, with two agents receiving 2 items each.

Let's begin by examining the valuations matrix:

```
     0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  69  48  97  74   4
1  18  17   8  22  41  26
2  53  65  47  40  74   3
3  94  95  24  52  72  66
```

We will allocate items to agents by ensuring each agent gets items they value as highly as possible, while minimizing envy among agents:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (97). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 3** highly values items 0 (94) and 1 (95). Let's allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (41). Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (74), but since it's already allocated, let's consider the next highest, item 2 (47). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 2** also has a reasonable valuation for item 5 (3), which hasn't been allocated yet. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, let's check if all items are allocated:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have been allocated.

Let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and at least one item:

- Agent 0: 1 item (3)
- Agent 1: 1 item (4)
- Agent 2: 2 items (2, 5)
- Agent 3: 2 items (0, 1)

The allocation is complete, and it follows the fair division principles as closely as possible with the given constraints.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
