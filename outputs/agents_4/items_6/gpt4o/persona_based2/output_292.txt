Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  60  46  18   2  81
1  25  78  64  93  10  93
2  90  97  46  36  39  74
3   2  80  36  61  81  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels another agent has a more valuable collection of items.

Let's first analyze the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 84 + 60 + 46 + 18 + 2 + 81 = 291
- Agent 1: 25 + 78 + 64 + 93 + 10 + 93 = 363
- Agent 2: 90 + 97 + 46 + 36 + 39 + 74 = 382
- Agent 3: 2 + 80 + 36 + 61 + 81 + 61 = 321

Given the total valuations, let's allocate items such that the division is envy-free and each agent receives an approximately equal share based on their preferences.

A potential allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 (value 84) and item 5 (value 81) to Agent 0. Total value = 165
- Assign item 3 (value 93) and item 4 (value 10) to Agent 1. Total value = 103
- Assign item 1 (value 97) to Agent 2. Total value = 97
- Assign item 2 (value 46) to Agent 3. Total value = 36

Let's ensure each agent receives an allocation and that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2

This allocation gives each agent a fair amount of value based on their preferences and ensures that all items are allocated.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
