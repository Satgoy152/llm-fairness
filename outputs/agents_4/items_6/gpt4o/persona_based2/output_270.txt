Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  61  81  33  31   2
1  11  34  36  88  96  43
2  98  95  25  87   6  74
3  50  35  56  17  20  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives an allocation in such a way that minimizes envy. One approach is to use an algorithm that seeks to achieve an envy-free allocation, if possible, or minimize envy otherwise.

In this scenario, we'll attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives items they value more highly, and we try to distribute the total value fairly.

Here’s one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 2 the most, followed by item 0 and item 1. However, giving them item 2 and item 0 would take away high-value items for other agents, so they will receive items 0 and 1.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the most, so we assign item 4 to them. They also have a relatively high valuation for item 3, so we give them item 3 as well.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 the highest, but since it’s already allocated to Agent 0, we look for the next best available option. They will receive item 5, which they value fairly high compared to other items.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5 the most, but it’s already allocated to Agent 2. They will receive item 2, which has a reasonable value for them.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. The allocation aims to reduce envy by considering the agents' valuations, although it may not be perfectly envy-free due to constraints.
