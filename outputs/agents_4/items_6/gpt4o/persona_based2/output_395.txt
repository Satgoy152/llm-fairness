Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  99  76  49  19   5
1  94  21  84   4  87   6
2  82   2  74   9  39  52
3  38  71  74  42  19  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To solve this problem, we should aim for an allocation that is as fair and envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, let's try to find an allocation that is as close to envy-free as possible.

Here are the valuations for each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [20, 99, 76, 49, 19, 5]
- Agent 1: [94, 21, 84, 4, 87, 6]
- Agent 2: [82, 2, 74, 9, 39, 52]
- Agent 3: [38, 71, 74, 42, 19, 84]

Let's attempt to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their own allocation while minimizing envy:

1. **Item 1:** Highest value is 99 by Agent 0.
2. **Item 3:** Highest value is 49 by Agent 0.
3. **Item 0:** Highest value is 94 by Agent 1.
4. **Item 4:** Highest value is 87 by Agent 1.
5. **Item 5:** Highest value is 84 by Agent 3.
6. **Item 2:** Highest value is 76 by Agent 0 (but already has two items, so consider others).

Given that Agent 0 already has two items that are highly valued, we need to distribute remaining items considering other agents' values:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 2 (second-highest value after Agent 0)
- Agent 3: Item 5

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's utility for their own bundle while ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5]
}
```
