Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  36  97  66   0  62
1  68  12  33   9  39  42
2  62  52   3  63  30  36
3  84  68  34   6  56  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56 36 97 66  0 62]
 [68 12 33  9 39 42]
 [62 52  3 63 30 36]
 [84 68 34  6 56 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, if possible, or at least a division that minimizes envy while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we'll try to allocate items to maximize perceived value for each agent.

### Valuations Table:
```
Agent \ Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5
--------------------------------------
0            | 56  36  97  66   0  62
1            | 68  12  33   9  39  42
2            | 62  52   3  63  30  36
3            | 84  68  34   6  56  22
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 2 (97) and item 3 (66).
2. **Agent 1**: Valued items are 0 (68) and 5 (42).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 0 (62), but item 3 (63) is also valuable.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 3 the most (84), but significant value in item 0 (84) and item 1 (68).

To ensure a fair division, we must distribute the items such that each agent gets items they value highly, but without duplicating assignments.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (highest value), Item 5
- **Agent 1**: Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Item 3
- **Agent 3**: Item 1, Item 4

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- All items are distributed.
- Agents receive items they value significantly, reducing potential envy.
- Each agent receives at least one item (except agent 1 receives two due to rounding the integer constraint).
