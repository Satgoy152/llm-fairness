Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  45   8  26  56  34
1  77  73  58  59  78   9
2  90  30  25  96  14  89
3   2  97  61  98  42   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to find an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. The goal is to minimize envy and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, while the total number of allocated items equals 6.

Let's first review the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [44, 45, 8, 26, 56, 34]
- Agent 1: [77, 73, 58, 59, 78, 9]
- Agent 2: [90, 30, 25, 96, 14, 89]
- Agent 3: [2, 97, 61, 98, 42, 4]

To make the allocation, we can use the following strategy:

1. Let agents choose their most valued items in a sequential manner, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and trying to maximize their total valuation.

2. Avoid giving an item to an agent if it causes significant envy from another agent who values that item much more.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest (98). Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest (90). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (78). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (45). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
5. Remaining items are 2 and 5. Let's allocate based on remaining preferences:
   - For item 2: Agent 3 (61) > Agent 1 (58).
   - For item 5: Agent 2 (89) > Agent 0 (34).

Thus, allocate item 2 to Agent 3 and item 5 to Agent 2.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their preferences, aiming to minimize overall envy.
