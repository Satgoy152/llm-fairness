Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  47  16  90  25  90
1  62  56  71  64  27  55
2  51  31  37  25  36  55
3  20  16  28  84  98  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuations. We also need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the problem by considering each agent's preferences and try to minimize envy:

### Agent Preferences:
- **Agent 0**: Values items 3 and 5 highly (both 90), followed by item 0 (87).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 2 highly (71), followed by item 3 (64).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highly (55), followed by item 0 (51).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 4 highly (98), followed by item 3 (84).

### Allocation Process:
1. **Item 4** is allocated to Agent 3 since they value it the highest (98).
2. **Item 3** is allocated to Agent 0 as it is one of their highest valued items (90) and agent 3 already has its highest valued item.
3. **Item 5** is allocated to Agent 2 as it's their highest valued item (55).
4. **Item 0** is allocated to Agent 0, as they value it second highest (87).
5. **Item 2** is allocated to Agent 1, as it's their highest valued item (71).
6. **Item 1** is allocated to Agent 1, as they have their next highest valuation for it (56).

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 4

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, reducing potential envy.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
