Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  61  69  16  49  66
1   7  74  20  55  86  59
2  95   7  70  15  64  76
3  61  56  21  47  28  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness and integer item assignments, we can use a simple heuristic approach to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation per Agent:** Sum the values each agent assigns to all items.
   
   - Agent 0: 36 + 61 + 69 + 16 + 49 + 66 = 297
   - Agent 1: 7 + 74 + 20 + 55 + 86 + 59 = 301
   - Agent 2: 95 + 7 + 70 + 15 + 64 + 76 = 327
   - Agent 3: 61 + 56 + 21 + 47 + 28 + 20 = 233

2. **Assign Items Based on Maximum Valuation:** Each item is assigned to the agent that values it most highly. This step ensures that each agent receives items that they value the most, which helps in achieving envy-freeness.

   - Item 0: Highest value is 95 (Agent 2)
   - Item 1: Highest value is 74 (Agent 1)
   - Item 2: Highest value is 70 (Agent 2)
   - Item 3: Highest value is 55 (Agent 1)
   - Item 4: Highest value is 86 (Agent 1)
   - Item 5: Highest value is 76 (Agent 2)

3. **Final Allocation:** Based on the highest valuations, the allocation is as follows:

   - Agent 0: No items (since other agents have higher valuations for each item)
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 5
   - Agent 3: No items (since other agents have higher valuations for each item)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most, and no items remain unallocated.

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 5],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation should satisfy the requirements of envy-freeness to a reasonable extent, given that each agent receives items that they value highly relative to the others.
