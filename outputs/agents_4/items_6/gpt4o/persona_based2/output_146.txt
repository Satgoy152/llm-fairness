Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  44  96  99  79  77
1  81  57  81  65  12  87
2  81  85  78  26  89  23
3  75  90  39  44  52  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41 44 96 99 79 77]
 [81 57 81 65 12 87]
 [81 85 78 26 89 23]
 [75 90 39 44 52 35]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations: 3 (99), 2 (96)

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valuations: 0 (81), 2 (81), 5 (87)

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valuations: 4 (89), 1 (85)

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest valuations: 1 (90), 3 (44)

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Items 2 and 3 (valuations 96 and 99)

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Item 5 (valuation 87)

- **Agent 2:** 
  - Item 4 (valuation 89)

- **Agent 3:** 
  - Items 0 and 1 (valuations 75 and 90)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item based on their highest preferences, aiming for envy-freeness:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
