Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  83   9  98  21  55
1   5  78  14  80  18  16
2  77  86   4  62  30  86
3  60  68  11  79  76  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49 83  9 98 21 55]
 [ 5 78 14 80 18 16]
 [77 86  4 62 30 86]
 [60 68 11 79 76 72]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items and aim to minimize envy, ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair portion according to their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving a fair division:

1. **Understand the Valuations**: Each agent has different valuations for each item. We need to consider how much each agent values each item and try to maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Maximize Total Value**: One way to approach this is to try maximizing the total value for each agent across their allocated items.

3. **Greedy Allocation**: A simple greedy approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation per item.

4. **Reallocation for Fairness**: If needed, adjust the allocation to reduce envy and ensure each agent gets a fair share.

Let's look at the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0: [49, 83, 9, 98, 21, 55]
- Agent 1: [5, 78, 14, 80, 18, 16]
- Agent 2: [77, 86, 4, 62, 30, 86]
- Agent 3: [60, 68, 11, 79, 76, 72]

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (98) - assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (86) - assign to Agent 2.
3. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (86) - assign to Agent 2.
4. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (77) - assign to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (76) - assign to Agent 3.
6. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (9), but all others are lower - assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's check for fairness:

- Agent 0: [3, 2] (98 + 9 = 107)
- Agent 1: [] (0)
- Agent 2: [1, 5, 0] (86 + 86 + 77 = 249)
- Agent 3: [4] (76)

To make it more balanced, let's adjust:

1. **Reallocate Item 0** to Agent 1 for fairness, as Agent 1 has no items.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [3, 2]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1, 5]
- Agent 3: [4]

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
