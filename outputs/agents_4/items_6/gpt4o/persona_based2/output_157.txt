Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  69  67  57  46  11
1  39  88  30  72   7  52
2  75  72  48  63   1  28
3  93  32  91  67  93  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [93 32 91 67 93 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items while considering each agent's valuations, we need to distribute the items in a way that aims to minimize envy. One common approach is to use a method like the "Envy-Free Matching" or "Max-Min Fairness" to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items.

Let's evaluate the table to allocate the items based on maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, while attempting to make the distribution as envy-free as possible.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [86, 69, 67, 57, 46, 11]
- Agent 1: [39, 88, 30, 72, 7, 52]
- Agent 2: [75, 72, 48, 63, 1, 28]
- Agent 3: [93, 32, 91, 67, 93, 56]

An allocation strategy can be:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value for this item).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for this item).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (highest value for this item).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest value but avoids conflict since 3 has item 0 and 2).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value for this item).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value not conflicting with other high-value assignments).

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences while trying to ensure no agent feels significantly disadvantaged.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
