Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  67  95  75  62  84
1  63  66  93  91  61  89
2  97  99  80  64  37  66
3  63  88  94  76  46  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 66 93 91 61 89]
 [97 99 80 64 37 66]
 [63 88 94 76 46 75]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, ensuring that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. We'll attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

Let's first summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0: [22, 67, 95, 75, 62, 84]
- Agent 1: [63, 66, 93, 91, 61, 89]
- Agent 2: [97, 99, 80, 64, 37, 66]
- Agent 3: [63, 88, 94, 76, 46, 75]

We will try to assign the items to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued items are 2 (95), 5 (84).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued items are 3 (91), 5 (89).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued items are 1 (99), 0 (97).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued items are 2 (94), 1 (88).

Based on these preferences, we can try to allocate items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [2, 5]. Total value = 95 + 84 = 179.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item [3]. Total value = 91.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item [0]. Total value = 97.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items [1, 4]. Total value = 88 + 46 = 134.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an allocation. Let's verify:

- Agent 0 has items [2, 5].
- Agent 1 has item [3].
- Agent 2 has item [0].
- Agent 3 has items [1, 4].

This arrangement seems to respect the agents' satisfaction for their most valued items, while ensuring the distribution of all items.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, providing each agent with a fair share based on their preferences.
