Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  24  75  84  10  98
1  73  68  38  89  78  13
2  42  78  86  52  26  56
3  93  94  35  92  14  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we'll try to distribute the items in such a way that this condition is satisfied as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Valuations:** We have the following valuations matrix for the agents and items.

   ```
   Agent 0: [28, 24, 75, 84, 10, 98]
   Agent 1: [73, 68, 38, 89, 78, 13]
   Agent 2: [42, 78, 86, 52, 26, 56]
   Agent 3: [93, 94, 35, 92, 14, 53]
   ```

2. **Initial Considerations:**
   - Each agent has different preferences for the items.
   - The sum of all itemsâ€™ values should be distributed among agents as evenly as possible.

3. **Allocate Items:**

   - **Agent 0:** Prefers item 5 (value 98) and item 3 (value 84).
   - **Agent 1:** Prefers item 3 (value 89) but since it is already considered for Agent 0, allocate item 0 (value 73).
   - **Agent 2:** Prefers item 2 (value 86).
   - **Agent 3:** Prefers item 1 (value 94).

4. **Remaining Items:**

   - Item 4 (Agent 1 values it at 78) can be allocated to Agent 1.
   - Review remaining preferences and values to ensure no agent envies another's allocation.

5. **Final Allocation:**

   After considering each agent's highest valued items and trying to balance the total value each agent receives, we can propose the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences while distributing the total value relatively evenly among the agents. Note that exact envy-freeness might not always be achievable with integer allocations, but this allocation tries to minimize potential envy.
