Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  62  41  66  90  74
1  57  72  46  37  50  58
2  90  11  32  59  77  21
3  89  26  96   4  38  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness is often challenging, we aim to minimize envy and ensure a fair distribution.

Here is one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Highest Valuation Method**: Each item is initially allocated to the agent who values it the most. If this results in an uneven distribution (e.g., one agent receiving too many items), we adjust by transferring items to meet the requirement that each agent receives at least one item.

2. **Balancing**: Adjust the initial allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item, considering the total number of items (6 in this case) and the number of agents (4), aiming for a fair distribution (ideally, 1 or 2 items per agent).

Let's apply this method:

**Initial Allocation by Highest Valuation**:
- Item 0: Agent 2 (value 90)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (value 72)
- Item 2: Agent 3 (value 96)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (value 66)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (value 90)
- Item 5: Agent 3 (value 87)

**Balancing**:
- Agent 0: Initially receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1: Receives item 1.
- Agent 2: Receives item 0.
- Agent 3: Initially receives items 2 and 5.

To balance the distribution, we can adjust as follows:
- Transfer item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 2. This gives each agent at least one item while keeping the total number of items allocated at 6.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [3]
- Agent 1: Items [1]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
