Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  91  58   2  11  90
1  33  41  88  85  87  88
2  49   1  85  14  75  90
3  90  62  33  37  91  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's try to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's preferences and ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. We'll aim for agents to receive items they value highly.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given table:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (value 97). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values items 2 and 5 highly (value 88 for both). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values items 5 the most (value 90). Assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most (value 91). Assign item 4 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate 2 more items. Let's distribute the remaining items (1 and 3) to agents who value them relatively more than others:

5. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly (value 91). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most among the remaining options (value 85). Assign item 3 to agent 1.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
