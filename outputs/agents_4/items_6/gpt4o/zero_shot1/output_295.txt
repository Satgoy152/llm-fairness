Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  40  23  28  61  76
1  15  61  59  30  14  53
2  70  25  82  57   6  14
3  94  39  52  91   4  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one common approach is to use the "maximum value" allocation strategy. This involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate each item:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 32
   - Agent 1 values it at 15
   - Agent 2 values it at 70
   - Agent 3 values it at 94
   - Agent 3 has the highest value for Item 0.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 40
   - Agent 1 values it at 61
   - Agent 2 values it at 25
   - Agent 3 values it at 39
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for Item 1.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 23
   - Agent 1 values it at 59
   - Agent 2 values it at 82
   - Agent 3 values it at 52
   - Agent 2 has the highest value for Item 2.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 28
   - Agent 1 values it at 30
   - Agent 2 values it at 57
   - Agent 3 values it at 91
   - Agent 3 has the highest value for Item 3.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 61
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 6
   - Agent 3 values it at 4
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for Item 4.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 53
   - Agent 2 values it at 14
   - Agent 3 values it at 77
   - Agent 3 has the highest value for Item 5.

Based on these evaluations, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets Item 4.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1.
- Agent 2 gets Item 2.
- Agent 3 gets Items 0, 3, and 5.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
