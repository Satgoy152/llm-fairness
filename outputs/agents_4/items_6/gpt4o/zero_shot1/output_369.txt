Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  93   5   1  88  40
1  24  28  34  76  84   8
2  83  22  58  24  14  65
3   9  61  74  34  28  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll aim to distribute the items in a way that is as fair as possible while considering the given valuations.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 3.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively balanced valuation but item 5 is the highest.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 5.

Considering the above, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0, as these are the items with the highest value for them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them.
- Assign items 2 and 5 to Agent 2, as item 5 is highly valued and item 2 has a decent score.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as it provides a reasonable balance with what remains.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.
