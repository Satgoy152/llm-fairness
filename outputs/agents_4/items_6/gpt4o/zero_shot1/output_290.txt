Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  86  98  92   9  48
1  23  89   9  44   8  39
2  47  42  95  40  88   4
3  52  28  74  71  81  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent or ensuring that each agent receives a number of items that they value highly. One possible approach is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are distributed.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (98), followed by item 3 (92).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (89).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most (88).
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (52).

We will begin by assigning the items based on the highest valuations:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have two remaining items (items 3 and 5) to allocate. We will assign these based on the next highest valuations:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their second highest value item.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is their next highest available value item.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed, with a focus on maximizing the agents' valuations.
