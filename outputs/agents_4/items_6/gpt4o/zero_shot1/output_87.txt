Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21   8  85  47  28  38
1  47  86  89  48  16  96
2  25  30  71  22  71  17
3  64  23  91  70  37  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21  8 85 47 28 38]
 [47 86 89 48 16 96]
 [25 30 71 22 71 17]
 [64 23 91 70 37 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize fairness and total value:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (85)
   - Allocated item: 2

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 5 (96)
   - Allocated item: 5

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Items 2 and 4 (71 each)
   - Item 2 is already taken, so allocate item 4.
   - Allocated item: 4

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (91)
   - Item 2 is already taken, next highest value is item 3 (70)
   - Allocated item: 3

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and we have 2 items left to allocate: 0 and 1.

5. **Remaining items**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (64 is the highest remaining value for this item)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (86 is the highest remaining value for this item)

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```
