Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  19  47  40  27  43
1  30  11  31  42  40  63
2   4  10   9  82  13  39
3   9  46  38  13  69  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 19 47 40 27 43]
 [30 11 31 42 40 63]
 [ 4 10  9 82 13 39]
 [ 9 46 38 13 69 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Let's analyze the valuation table to determine an optimal allocation.

### Valuation Table:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  19  47  40  27  43
1  30  11  31  42  40  63
2   4  10   9  82  13  39
3   9  46  38  13  69  32
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 2 (47).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 5 (63).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 3 (82).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 4 (69).

After assigning these items, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 1).

5. **Agent 0**: The second highest valuation is for item 5 (43), but it's already allocated. The next highest is for item 3 (40), but it's already allocated. Next is item 0 (35).
6. **Agent 3**: The next highest valuation is for item 1 (46).

### Final Allocations:
Based on this analysis, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item and maximizes the total valuations as fairly as possible.
