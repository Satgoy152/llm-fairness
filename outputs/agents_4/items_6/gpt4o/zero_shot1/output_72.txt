Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  13  75  80  80  52
1  33  62  21  27  18  64
2  73  43  50  94  64  62
3  75  44  86   6  79  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 62 21 27 18 64]
 [73 43 50 94 64 62]
 [75 44 86  6 79 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for several items, particularly item 0 (97) and item 3 (80). Assign item 0 to Agent 0 to maximize their total value.

2. Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5 (64). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. Agent 2:
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (94). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

4. Agent 3:
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the most (86). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to distribute the remaining 2 items, considering the next highest valuations:

5. Remaining items are 1 and 4. 

   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they have the second-highest valuation for it (62).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation (80) for it.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item.
