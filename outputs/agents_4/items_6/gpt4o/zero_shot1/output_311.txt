Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  10  78  56  22  66  64
1  20  88  50   0  77  46
2  68  57  70  70  31  20
3   5   5  18  76  66  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Here is a way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly (78) and item 5 fairly well (64).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (77).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly (70) and item 3 equally as well (70).
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highly (76), but since item 3 is equally valued by agent 2 and agent 2 has fewer items, give item 3 to agent 2.

Given these preferences, we can construct a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 3 receives item 0.

Now, verifying all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items, the allocations can be expressed in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
