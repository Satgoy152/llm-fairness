Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  50  39  12  93  41
1  23  33   6   1  41  58
2  44  20  17   5  24   7
3  48  68   9  61  47   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must consider the valuations each agent places on the items. A common strategy is to maximize the total valuation of the allocated items or to ensure a balanced distribution of high-value items among agents. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
   - Agent 1 has a relatively higher valuation for item 5.
   - Agent 2's valuations are generally lower, but item 0 is the highest among their preferences.
   - Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3 and item 1.

2. **Allocation Strategy**: 
   - Assign items with the highest value to each agent without overlapping.
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

3. **Proposed Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 4 (values 79 and 93).
   - Agent 1: Assign item 5 (value 58).
   - Agent 2: Assign item 2 (value 17).
   - Agent 3: Assign items 1 and 3 (values 68 and 61).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, considering the distribution among agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
