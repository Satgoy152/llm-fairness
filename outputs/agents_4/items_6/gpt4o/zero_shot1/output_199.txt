Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  56  43  83  16  58
1  20  40  42  57  28  64
2  91  51   8  19  59  56
3  12  64  23  78  49   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20 40 42 57 28 64]
 [91 51  8 19 59 56]
 [12 64 23 78 49  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning the items to the agents who value them the most. This isn't the only method, but it is a straightforward approach to balancing fairness with maximizing value.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 with a valuation of 91, which is the highest valuation for that item across all agents.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 with a valuation of 83, which is the highest valuation for that item across all agents.
3. **Agent 3** highly values item 1 with a valuation of 64, which is the highest valuation for that item across all agents.
4. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 with a valuation of 64, which is the highest valuation for that item across all agents.
5. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 with a valuation of 59.
6. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 with a valuation of 43.

After this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all agents have received at least one item. 

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
