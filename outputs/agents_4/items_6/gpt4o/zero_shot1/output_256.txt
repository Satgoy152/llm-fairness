Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  53   6  53  38  25
1  18  47  33  63  17  26
2  47  23  64  85  20  65
3  30  42  22  89  92  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach, such as maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This ensures that the distribution is relatively fair based on the given valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (84)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (63)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (85), but it's already assigned.
   - Next highest value item: Item 5 (65)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (92)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

After assigning the highest value items to each agent, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Remaining items: 1, 2
   - Choose the highest value: Item 1 (53)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining items: 2
   - Assign the only remaining item, item 2, to Agent 2.

Here is the allocation in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item, while attempting to maximize their individual valuations.
