Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  33  13  69  31  41
1  57  68  75  37   1  55
2  78  23   8  67   4  19
3  11  64  10  47   9  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, considering that each agent should ideally get at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:** Start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item:** If an agent doesn't get any items through the highest valuation process, look for the next best item they can receive without drastically reducing the overall fairness.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If any agent ends up with no items, reallocate items from agents with multiple items to balance the distribution.

Let's go through the process:

- **Item 0:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation (78).
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 has the highest valuation (68).
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 has the highest valuation (75).
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation (69).
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation (31).
- **Item 5:** Agent 3 has the highest valuation (95).

Now, verify allocation balance and fairness:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 5

Each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is balanced based on the highest valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.
