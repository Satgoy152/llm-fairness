Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21   3  13  40  19  61
1  52  82  58  47   2  25
2  55  53  50  55  28  17
3  63  71  62   0  33  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21  3 13 40 19 61]
 [52 82 58 47  2 25]
 [55 53 50 55 28 17]
 [63 71 62  0 33 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 6 items and 4 agents, not every agent will receive an item, as some agents may receive more than one item, and some may receive none.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate the items to maximize the respective values for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**  
    - Highest valuation: Item 5 (value = 61)

2. **Agent 1:**  
    - Highest valuation: Item 1 (value = 82)

3. **Agent 2:**  
    - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value = 55)

4. **Agent 3:**  
    - Highest valuation: Item 5 (value = 88) - Already assigned to Agent 0, next highest is Item 1 (value = 71) - Already assigned to Agent 1, next highest is Item 2 (value = 62)

Now let's check the next highest valuations among the remaining unallocated items:

- **Remaining unallocated items:** 3, 4
- **Agent 0:** Highest among remaining is Item 3 (value = 40)
- **Agent 1:** Highest among remaining is Item 4 (value = 2)
- **Agent 2:** Highest among remaining is Item 4 (value = 28)
- **Agent 3:** Highest among remaining is Item 4 (value = 33)

Now allocate the remaining items:

- **Item 3:** Goes to Agent 0 (highest remaining value among unallocated)
- **Item 4:** Goes to Agent 3 (highest remaining value among unallocated)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and the agents receive items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations as much as possible under the conditions given.
