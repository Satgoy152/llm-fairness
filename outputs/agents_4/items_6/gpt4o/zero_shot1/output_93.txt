Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  46  11  61  58  74
1  43  37   4  17  73  37
2  39   7   5   1  44  67
3  53  84  59  48  65   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 46 11 61 58 74]
 [43 37  4 17 73 37]
 [39  7  5  1 44 67]
 [53 84 59 48 65  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent given the constraints that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items must be allocated. Let's consider the valuations given in the table:

```
Agent 0: [35, 46, 11, 61, 58, 74]
Agent 1: [43, 37,  4, 17, 73, 37]
Agent 2: [39,  7,  5,  1, 44, 67]
Agent 3: [53, 84, 59, 48, 65,  4]
```

One way to approach this problem is to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each item among the agents, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. After analyzing the table:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (53).
2. Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (84).
3. Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (59).
4. Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (61).
5. Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (73).
6. Item 5: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (74).

Based on this analysis, the allocations can be as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: No items (since they have the lowest valuations)
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1, 2

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
