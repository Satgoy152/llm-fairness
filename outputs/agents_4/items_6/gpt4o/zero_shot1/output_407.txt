Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  40  99  84   8  44
1  18  33  28  81  95  37
2  95  44  34  36  68   0
3  38  78  45  51  66   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with integer assignments, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We will consider the preferences of each agent based on their valuations and try to distribute the items accordingly.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (99) and 3 (84).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 (95) and 3 (81).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 0 (95) and 1 (44).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (78) and 3 (51).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining items, 3 and 5, considering the next highest valuations that have not been allocated:

- **Agent 1**: Item 3 has the second-highest value for Agent 1 (81). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0**: Item 5 (44) is the next highest available value for Agent 0. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
