Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  15  32   9  66  84
1  24  20  20  93  14  33
2   7  46  32  97   4  61
3  87  70  44  12  54  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute them in a way that maximizes their satisfaction. Let's look at a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 5 the highest (84). 
   - Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values item 3 the highest (93).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken by Agent 1. 
   - Next highest is item 5, but it's allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next is item 2 (32). 
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values item 0 the highest (87).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. Remaining items to be allocated: 1 and 4.

Let's re-evaluate the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: 5
- **Agent 1**: 3
- **Agent 2**: 2
- **Agent 3**: 0

Now, for the remaining items (1 and 4):

- Item 1:
  - Highest remaining value is for Agent 3 (70). 
  - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

- Item 4:
  - Highest remaining value is for Agent 0 (66).
  - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 5, 4
- **Agent 1**: 3
- **Agent 2**: 2
- **Agent 3**: 0, 1

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
