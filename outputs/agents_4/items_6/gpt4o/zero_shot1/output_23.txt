Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92   5  75  21  71  32
1  40  37  68  30  77  91
2  86  45  68  55  75  42
3  68  11  23  11  57  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92  5 75 21 71 32]
 [40 37 68 30 77 91]
 [86 45 68 55 75 42]
 [68 11 23 11 57 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a suggested allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 0 (value 92). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 5 (value 91). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 0 (value 86). However, since item 0 is assigned to Agent 0, the next highest value for Agent 2 is item 2 (value 68). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value items for Agent 3 are item 0 (value 68) and item 4 (value 57). Since item 0 is already assigned, assign item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items**: Items 1 and 3 are unassigned. We can assign them based on remaining capacity and values.

   - For item 1, Agent 2 values it at 45, which is the highest unassigned value for that item. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

   - For item 3, Agent 2 values it highest at 55. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Based on this allocation, the final assignment looks like this:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all six items are assigned, and each agent receives at least one item.
