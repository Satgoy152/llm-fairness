Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  19  24  44  85  95
1  94  16  73  29  34  74
2  84  37  10  33  80  94
3  15  55   8  77  62  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuations:**
   - For each item, identify which agent values it the most.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Preferences:**
   - Attempt to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items.

3. **Ensure Fair Distribution:**
   - Since there are 4 agents and 6 items, two agents will receive 2 items each, and two agents will receive 1 item each.
   - Ensure that no agent receives all low-value items if possible.

Letâ€™s allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
- **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most at 55.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 73.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most at 77.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.

Now, let's balance the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives no items (but we should check if this can be improved by switching with another agent).
- Agent 3 receives items 1 and 3.

Reviewing the fairness, it seems agent 2 is left out, which is not ideal. To adjust, we can consider switching an item from an agent with 2 items to agent 2.

Switching item 3 from Agent 3 to Agent 2 might be reasonable, given that Agent 2 has a decent value for it (33).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
