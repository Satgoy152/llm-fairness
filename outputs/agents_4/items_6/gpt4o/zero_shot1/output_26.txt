Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  35  80  38  64  64
1  11   9  44  11  28  31
2  56  31  41  42  64  48
3  18  25  21  39  85  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a greedy method where we assign items based on the highest individual valuations first. Let's examine the valuations and allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items: 
   - Item 2 (80)
   - Item 0 (49)
   - Item 4 (64)
   - Item 5 (64)

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items:
   - Item 2 (44)

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items:
   - Item 0 (56)
   - Item 4 (64)

4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items:
   - Item 4 (85)

Let's allocate the items:

- Start with the highest valuation, which is Agent 3 for Item 4 (85). Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.

- Next, Agent 0 has high valuations for Items 2, 0, and 5. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

- Agent 2 also values Item 4 but it's already allocated; however, Agent 2 highly values Item 0. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

- Agent 0 has high valuation for Item 5. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

- Now, Items 1 and 3 are remaining. Agent 0 could take Item 1 since it has a higher value for it than other agents.

- Finally, assign the remaining Item 3 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 has a better valuation for it than Agent 2.

Now the allocation is complete, and we can present it in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
