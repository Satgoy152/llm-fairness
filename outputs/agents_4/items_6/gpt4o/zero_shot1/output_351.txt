Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  22  43  65  31  73
1  11  99  11  62  69  63
2  55  29   1  28  90  70
3  36  48  56   5  45  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 22 43 65 31 73]
 [11 99 11 62 69 63]
 [55 29  1 28 90 70]
 [36 48 56  5 45 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. One way to approach this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 2 values it the most at 55.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 3 values it the most at 56.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it the most at 65.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it the most at 90.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the most at 73.

Now, assigning these items to the agents, we have:

Agent 0: Items [3, 5]  
Agent 1: Item [1]  
Agent 2: Items [0, 4]  
Agent 3: Item [2]  

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
