Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  32  37  69  48  75
1  31  92  42  50  48  89
2   7  64  53  21  29  77
3   1  61  72  70  22  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing each agent's total value from the items they receive, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's try to allocate items in such a way that the total value for each agent is reasonably balanced. We'll do this by considering the highest value an agent has for any remaining item.

1. Start by sorting each agent's preferences to identify which items they value most.
2. Allocate items one by one, choosing the highest-valued item that has not yet been allocated.
3. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0: Values items [5, 3, 4, 2, 1, 0] in descending order of value.
- Agent 1: Values items [1, 5, 3, 2, 0, 4] in descending order of value.
- Agent 2: Values items [5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 0] in descending order of value.
- Agent 3: Values items [5, 2, 3, 1, 4, 0] in descending order of value.

Following this plan, we allocate:

- Item 5: Highest value to Agent 0 (75), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Highest remaining value to Agent 1 (92), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Highest remaining value to Agent 3 (72), assign to Agent 3.
- Item 3: Highest remaining value to Agent 0 (69), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Highest remaining value to Agent 0 (48), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 0: Highest remaining value to Agent 1 (31), assign to Agent 1.

After this allocation, each agent receives items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and attempts to maximize the total value for each agent.
