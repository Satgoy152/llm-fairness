Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  18  63  19  50  40
1  75  81  44  69  54  61
2  18  73  33  61  18   0
3  70  26  36  39  61  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75 81 44 69 54 61]
 [18 73 33 61 18  0]
 [70 26 36 39 61 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. We can approach this by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring that each agent gets at least one of their highest preferences.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value 63).
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (value 81).
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most, but it is already assigned. The next highest is item 3 (value 61).
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the most (value 87).
   - Assign item 5 to agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 4:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 second highest (value 50).
   - Assign item 4 to agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 second highest (value 75).
   - Assign item 0 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5]
}
```
