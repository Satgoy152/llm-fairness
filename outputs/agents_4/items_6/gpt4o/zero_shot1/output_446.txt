Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  28  57   3  59  48
1  85  37  61  23  25  22
2  23  56  83  92  49  81
3  53  84  25  67  62  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the valuations provided in the table, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives the most value possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most**:
   - Item 0: Highest value by agent 1 (85)
   - Item 1: Highest value by agent 3 (84)
   - Item 2: Highest value by agent 2 (83)
   - Item 3: Highest value by agent 2 (92)
   - Item 4: Highest value by agent 0 (59)
   - Item 5: Highest value by agent 2 (81)

2. **Check allocations and adjust if needed**:
   - Agent 0: Item 4
   - Agent 1: Item 0
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 5
   - Agent 3: Item 1

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and every agent gets at least one item. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is fairly distributed to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
