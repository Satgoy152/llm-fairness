Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  14   8  57   5   4
1  17  90   5  96  82  99
2  72  96  51   8  30  98
3  75   8   5  87  96  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[45 14  8 57  5  4]
 [17 90  5 96 82 99]
 [72 96 51  8 30 98]
 [75  8  5 87 96 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that considers maximizing the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's evaluate the table given and allocate the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Values items: [45, 14, 8, 57, 5, 4]
   - Highest value item: 3 (57)
   
2. Agent 1:
   - Values items: [17, 90, 5, 96, 82, 99]
   - Highest value item: 5 (99)

3. Agent 2:
   - Values items: [72, 96, 51, 8, 30, 98]
   - Highest value item: 1 (96)

4. Agent 3:
   - Values items: [75, 8, 5, 87, 96, 10]
   - Highest value item: 4 (96)

Now we need to allocate the remaining items considering fairness and maximizing total utility:

- Agent 0's second highest value is item 0 (45)
- Agent 1's second highest value is item 3 (96)
- Agent 2's second highest value is item 5 (98)
- Agent 3's second highest value is item 0 (75)

Assign items to agents based on their top choices while ensuring no overlaps:

- Agent 0 gets item 3
- Agent 1 gets item 5
- Agent 2 gets item 1
- Agent 3 gets item 4

Now, we have assigned 4 items, and need to allocate the remaining 2:

- Agent 0 can receive item 0
- Agent 2 can receive item 2

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
