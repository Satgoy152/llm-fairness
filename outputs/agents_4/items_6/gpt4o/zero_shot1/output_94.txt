Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  26  48   4  41  98
1   3  29  44  91  83  61
2  72  65  84  24  43  60
3  59  89  31  40  81   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction, ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy method, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than their fair share.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is by Agent 2 with 72.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is by Agent 3 with 89.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is by Agent 2 with 84.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is by Agent 1 with 91.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is by Agent 1 with 83.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is by Agent 0 with 98.

Now, let's ensure no agent gets more than their fair share, which is approximately 1.5 items since there are 4 agents and 6 items.

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 3: Item 1

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all 6 items are distributed.
