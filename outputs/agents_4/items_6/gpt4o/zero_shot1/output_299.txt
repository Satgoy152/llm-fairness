Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  60  17  20   0  63
1  35  72  19  48  21   4
2  18  87  91  77   9  97
3  50   7  45  38  23  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the method known as "maximum total value allocation," where we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. This involves assigning items to agents such that the sum of the values of the items assigned to each agent is as high as possible. However, we must ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate a possible allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the highest at 91.
2. Assign item 5 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the highest at 97.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the highest at 87.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the highest at 69.
5. Assign item 3 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it the highest at 48.
6. Assign item 4 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it the highest at 21.

This allocation attempts to give items to the agents who value them the most, maximizing the total value derived from the allocation.

Here's the allocation presented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 5],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agents receive items they value highly.
