Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  92  77  75  45  59
1  34  27  59  92  78  84
2  55  27  55  90  77  95
3  25  30  49  87  53  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 27 55 90 77 95]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 1 (92)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 3 (92)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 5 (95)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 3 (87), but item 3 is already assigned.
   - Next highest valuation for item 5 (85), but item 5 is already assigned.
   - Assign item 2 (49) to Agent 3, which is their next highest available valuation.

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 0 and 4 are still unallocated.

6. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Item 0: Highest unallocated valuation is Agent 0 with 82.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Highest unallocated valuation is Agent 1 with 78.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
