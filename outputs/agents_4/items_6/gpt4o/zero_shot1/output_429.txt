Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  95  33  70  33  15
1  16  44  67  55  73  99
2  48  13  19  71  54  93
3  92  63  67  51  32   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 95 33 70 33 15]
 [16 44 67 55 73 99]
 [48 13 19 71 54 93]
 [92 63 67 51 32  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value of the allocation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to maximize the overall value for each agent's allocation.

Let's examine the table of valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 76     | 95     | 33     | 70     | 33     | 15     |
| 1     | 16     | 44     | 67     | 55     | 73     | 99     |
| 2     | 48     | 13     | 19     | 71     | 54     | 93     |
| 3     | 92     | 63     | 67     | 51     | 32     | 5      |

Let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's total valuation:

1. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (92). Let's allocate item 0 to agent 3.
2. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (95). Let's allocate item 1 to agent 0.
3. Agent 1 values item 5 the most (99). Let's allocate item 5 to agent 1.
4. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (71). Let's allocate item 3 to agent 2.
5. Agent 1 values item 4 the second most (73). Let's allocate item 4 to agent 1.
6. Agent 3 values item 2 the second most (67). Let's allocate item 2 to agent 3.

Now, let's summarize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
