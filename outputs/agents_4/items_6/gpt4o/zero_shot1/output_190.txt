Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  62  84  63  64   4
1  43  24  36   7  95  25
2  37  35   8  45  78   5
3  84  16  33  52  32  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or utility each agent derives from their allocated items. We can use a balanced approach to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, given there are four agents and six items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2.
- Agent 1 highly values item 4.
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 as well, but also somewhat values item 3.
- Agent 3 has high valuation for item 5.

We'll aim to allocate the highest valued items to each agent while ensuring each gets at least one item.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2 (valuations 84 and 84)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (valuation 95)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (valuation 45)
- Agent 3: Items 1 and 5 (valuations 16 and 90)

This allocation considers the high-value items each agent desires and distributes all six items.

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation adheres to the constraints specified.
