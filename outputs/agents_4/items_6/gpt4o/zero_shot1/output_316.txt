Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  86  64  72  78  41
1  57  97  12  30  58  46
2  18  21  50  59  52   0
3  19  35  22  23  32  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 86 64 72 78 41]
 [57 97 12 30 58 46]
 [18 21 50 59 52  0]
 [19 35 22 23 32 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's utility based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Let's follow this approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Values are [85, 86, 64, 72, 78, 41]. The highest value is 86 (item 1).
2. **Agent 1**: Values are [57, 97, 12, 30, 58, 46]. The highest value is 97 (item 1), but it's already taken, so the next highest is 58 (item 4).
3. **Agent 2**: Values are [18, 21, 50, 59, 52, 0]. The highest value is 59 (item 3).
4. **Agent 3**: Values are [19, 35, 22, 23, 32, 72]. The highest value is 72 (item 5).

Now let's assign the remaining items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 1. Next highest value for unallocated items is 85 (item 0).
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 4. Next highest value for unallocated items is 57 (item 0), but it's taken. So, they get item 2 (value 12).
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 3. No other items remain unallocated.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 5. Next highest value for unallocated items is 35 (item 1), but it's taken, so they get item 2 (value 22).

After reviewing, we can finalize the allocation as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed based on the valuations provided.
