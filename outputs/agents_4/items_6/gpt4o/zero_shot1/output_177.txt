Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  16  98  83  49  11
1  68  71  69  56  44  44
2  62  78  38  92  17  96
3  38  10  15   1   6  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74 16 98 83 49 11]
 [68 71 69 56 44 44]
 [62 78 38 92 17 96]
 [38 10 15  1  6 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the valuation table, we can use a simple greedy approach to assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations.

Let's examine the table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3. We can start by assigning these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** can be assigned item 1, which has a high valuation.
3. **Agent 2** can be assigned items 5 and 4, which have relatively high valuations for this agent.
4. **Agent 3** will not receive any items as the valuations for all items are lower compared to other agents' allocations.

Here is a possible allocation based on this logic:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5
- Agent 3: No items

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items, with the goal of maximizing the overall valuations based on the given table.
