Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  79  26  64  96  59
1  86  53  71  69  45  74
2  97  42  26  64  10   2
3  71  12  47  32  12  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 4, making them a strong candidate for these items.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most, and also has a decent valuation for item 5.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (though it's already allocated to Agent 0) but can be allocated item 3 as the next best option.
4. **Agent 3** could be given item 1, which they value the least but still have some value for, leaving them with at least one item.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
