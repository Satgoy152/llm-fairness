Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  77  13  84  65   7
1  26  79  77  89   8  93
2  75  42  49  77  37  61
3  93  23  99  19  75  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value for the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll do this by looking at the preferences each agent has for the items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (value 84)
   - Second highest: Item 1 (value 77)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (value 93)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (value 89)
   - Third highest: Item 1 (value 79)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (value 75)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 99)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (value 93)

Allocation process:
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 84)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 93)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (value 75)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 3 (value 99)

Now, we have assigned 4 items. Let's assign the remaining 2 items with a fair distribution:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (value 79)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 (value 75)

Now, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.
