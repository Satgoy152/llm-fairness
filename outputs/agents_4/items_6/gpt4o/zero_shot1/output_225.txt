Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  20  22  99  95   1
1  85  96  81  75  38  44
2   0  36  13  20  28  91
3  85  51  60  54  52  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze each agent's valuations and determine a fair allocation.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 and 4. 
2. **Agent 1** has consistently high valuations across most items, but particularly for items 0 and 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5.
4. **Agent 3** has moderate valuations across the board, but item 0 is more valuable for them compared to others.

With this in mind, let's distribute the items:

- Agent 0 gets the items with the highest individual value to them, which are items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1, having high valuations, can take items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 should take item 5, where their valuation is highest.
- Agent 3 can take item 2 as it provides a moderate value to them, and it's not prioritized by others.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed such that each agent maximizes their total received value, adhering to the constraint of distributing exactly 6 items.
