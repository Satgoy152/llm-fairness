Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  84  66  95  54   7
1  26  69  80  58  32  31
2  82  52  35  86  20  31
3  17  16   6   7  86  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll use a method that attempts to assign items to the agents based on the highest value they attribute to those items.

First, let's analyze the agent valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it highest at 82.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it highest at 84.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest at 80.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it highest at 95.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it highest at 86.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it highest at 63.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these valuations:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the highest. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
