Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  83  13  12  75  11
1  87  82  61  18  93  28
2  62  44  79  12  67   0
3  36  79  64  13  34  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that considers each agent's valuation of items to maximize fairness. One approach is to allocate items based on a modified "round-robin" method, where we prioritize assigning items to agents who value them the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [29, 83, 13, 12, 75, 11]
- Agent 1 values: [87, 82, 61, 18, 93, 28]
- Agent 2 values: [62, 44, 79, 12, 67, 0]
- Agent 3 values: [36, 79, 64, 13, 34, 41]

We'll follow these steps for allocation:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. If an agent already has an item, consider the next highest valuation for the allocation.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it highest at 87.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it highest at 83.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it highest at 79.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 18, but Agent 3 hasn't received an item yet, so give it to Agent 3.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it highest at 93, but to ensure fairness, give it to Agent 0 (next highest value 75 who has only one item).
6. Item 5: Agent 3 values it at 41, but Agent 2 hasn't received a second item yet, so give it to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their valuations while keeping the distribution fair.
