Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  85   3  76  72  32
1  48  54   0  84  43  85
2  36  20  43  65  64  88
3  62  99  85  24   2  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 20 43 65 64 88]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's attempt to assign items where each agent receives the items they value the most.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [71, 85, 3, 76, 72, 32]
   - Highest value: 85 for item 1
   - Next highest value: 76 for item 3

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [48, 54, 0, 84, 43, 85]
   - Highest value: 85 for item 5
   - Next highest value: 84 for item 3 (already assigned to Agent 0), so choose item 1 (already assigned to Agent 0) or item 0

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [36, 20, 43, 65, 64, 88]
   - Highest value: 88 for item 5 (already assigned to Agent 1), so choose item 3 (already assigned), then item 4

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [62, 99, 85, 24, 2, 99]
   - Highest value: 99 for items 1 and 5 (both already assigned), so choose item 2

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 3
- Agent 1 gets items: 5, 0
- Agent 2 gets items: 4
- Agent 3 gets items: 2

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item where possible, with a focus on maximizing the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
