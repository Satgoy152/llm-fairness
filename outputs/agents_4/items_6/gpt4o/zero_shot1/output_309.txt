Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  65   3  48  65  95
1  31  77  19   2  11  29
2  84  43  17  85  46   0
3  21  28  28  28  15  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 65  3 48 65 95]
 [31 77 19  2 11 29]
 [84 43 17 85 46  0]
 [21 28 28 28 15 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 5 (95), 1 (65), 4 (65), 3 (48), 0 (25), 2 (3)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 1 (77), 0 (31), 2 (19), 5 (29), 4 (11), 3 (2)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 0 (84), 3 (85), 1 (43), 4 (46), 2 (17), 5 (0)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 5 (81), 1 (28), 2 (28), 3 (28), 0 (21), 4 (15)

Let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

- **Agent 0**: Item 5 (95)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (77)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (85)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (28)

Now we need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 4):

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (65)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (31)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is done fairly based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```
