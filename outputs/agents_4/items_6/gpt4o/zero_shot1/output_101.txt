Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  81  22  46  49  11
1  88  52  88  12   2   4
2   5  51  78   7  98  23
3  68  24  67  24  46  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 52 88 12  2  4]
 [ 5 51 78  7 98 23]
 [68 24 67 24 46 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we'll try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to approach it:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for items 1 and 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for items 2 and 0.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 4.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 5.

We can allocate based on the highest valuations as follows:

- **Agent 0** gets items [1, 0]
- **Agent 1** gets item [2]
- **Agent 2** gets item [4]
- **Agent 3** gets items [5, 3]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations, while all items are allocated.
