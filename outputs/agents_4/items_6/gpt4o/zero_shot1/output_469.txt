Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29   2  84  21  39  97
1  31  28  44  77  35   4
2  77  76  21  51  28   3
3  54  58  41  18  14  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[29  2 84 21 39 97]
 [31 28 44 77 35  4]
 [77 76 21 51 28  3]
 [54 58 41 18 14 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's analyze the valuations and try to assign items optimally.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items 2 and 5 have the highest valuations for agent 0, with values of 84 and 97 respectively.
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3 has the highest valuation for agent 1, with a value of 77.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 0 has the highest valuation for agent 2, with a value of 77.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 1 has the highest valuation for agent 3, with a value of 58.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, with agents 0 and 1 needing more items.

5. **Agent 0** (continued):
   - From the remaining items (2, 4), item 2 has the highest valuation for agent 0, with a value of 84.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1** (continued):
   - Item 4 has a decent valuation for agent 1, with a value of 35.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

After considering the highest valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```
