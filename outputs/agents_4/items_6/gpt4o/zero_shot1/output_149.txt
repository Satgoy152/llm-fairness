Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94   7  45  42  77  79
1  96  41  37  10  23  39
2  77  13  30  77  60  71
3  47  40  20   3  33  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, let's aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. We can use a greedy algorithm approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Sort agents by their total valuation in descending order.
3. Allocate items to agents by iterating over the sorted list of agents, assigning each agent the item they value most that hasn't been allocated yet, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Below are the total valuations each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 94 + 7 + 45 + 42 + 77 + 79 = 344
- Agent 1: 96 + 41 + 37 + 10 + 23 + 39 = 246
- Agent 2: 77 + 13 + 30 + 77 + 60 + 71 = 328
- Agent 3: 47 + 40 + 20 + 3 + 33 + 47 = 190

Now, we will allocate items based on this valuation:

- Agent 0 (total valuation 344): Allocated item 0 (value 94).
- Agent 2 (total valuation 328): Allocated item 3 (value 77).
- Agent 1 (total valuation 246): Allocated item 1 (value 41).
- Agent 3 (total valuation 190): Allocated item 5 (value 47).
- Agent 0 (next highest valuation): Allocated item 4 (value 77).
- Agent 2 (next highest valuation): Allocated item 2 (value 30).

The allocations can be presented in the requested JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [5]
}
```
