Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56   8  74  28  78  19
1  50  45  14   3  95   2
2  91  18  18  41  23  82
3   4  84  21  86  88  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 45 14  3 95  2]
 [91 18 18 41 23 82]
 [ 4 84 21 86 88 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all six items being allocated in total.

Let's consider possible allocations:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - High valuations for items 2, 4, and 0.

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Highest valuation for item 4, followed by item 0.

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Highest valuation for item 0, followed by item 5.

4. Agent 3 values:
   - High valuations for items 3, 4, and 1.

By prioritizing each agent's highest-valued items, we aim to achieve a fair distribution:

- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 0 to agent 2 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (high valuation).
- Assign item 3 to agent 3 (high valuation).
- Assign item 5 to agent 2 (second-highest valuation).
- Assign item 1 to agent 3 (second-highest valuation).

Therefore, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that have relatively high valuations for them while distributing all six items.
