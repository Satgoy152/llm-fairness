Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  11  62  65   5  74
1  76  11  48  96  28  42
2  41   4  74  34  24  89
3  54  65  68  38  23  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Identify the highest value pairings** for each agent.
2. **Allocate one item to each agent** based on their highest valuation.
3. **Distribute the remaining items** by considering the next highest valuations without repeating allocations.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest value: Item 0 (96)
  - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest value: Item 3 (96)
  - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest value: Item 5 (89)
  - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2

- **Agent 3**:
  - Highest value: Item 5 (94) - already taken
  - Next highest: Item 1 (65)
  - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3

Now, allocate the remaining two items:

- **Remaining Items**: 2, 4

- **Agent 0**:
  - Next highest: Item 2 (62)
  - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0

- **Agent 2**:
  - Next highest: Item 4 (24)
  - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

Each agent gets at least one item, and all six items are allocated.
