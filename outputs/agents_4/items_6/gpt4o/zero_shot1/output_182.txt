Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  13  90  23  64  93
1   7  20  12  67  77   7
2  80  10  31  91  14  10
3   2  34  50  91  22  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 2 13 90 23 64 93]
 [ 7 20 12 67 77  7]
 [80 10 31 91 14 10]
 [ 2 34 50 91 22 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents while trying to maximize total valuation, we will consider the highest valuation each agent has for the items and allocate accordingly. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 5 (90 and 93 respectively).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 4 (67 and 77 respectively).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has a very high valuation for item 0 (80).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 1 (34).

Let's allocate the items based on these observations to maximize the overall satisfaction:

- Assign item 2 and item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 and item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

This allocation allows each agent to get the item(s) they value highly, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1]
}
```
