Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  46  84   2  42  83
1  82  57   4   0  45  83
2  38  73   4  77  68  57
3  26  81  21  42  98  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 57  4  0 45 83]
 [38 73  4 77 68 57]
 [26 81 21 42 98 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a strategy to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 4 agents and 6 items, at least two agents will receive two items. We will prioritize items to agents based on their individual valuations.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value for items: 0 (85), 2 (84), 5 (83).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for items: 0 (82), 5 (83).
   - Since item 0 is taken, allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for items: 3 (77), 1 (73).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value for items: 4 (98), 1 (81).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, two items remain (1 and 2), and need to be distributed among the agents.

5. **Remaining Allocations**:
   - For item 1:
     - Agent 0: 46
     - Agent 1: 57
     - Agent 2: 73
     - Agent 3: 81
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (highest value).

6. **Final Remaining Item (2)**:
   - For item 2:
     - Agent 0: 84
     - Agent 1: 4
     - Agent 2: 4
     - Agent 3: 21
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated fairly, maximizing individual agent valuations.
