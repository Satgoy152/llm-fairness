Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  59  87  24  34  87
1  43  90  51  87  58  93
2  89  49  39  52  70  41
3  66  73  77   3  63  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 59 87 24 34 87]
 [43 90 51 87 58 93]
 [89 49 39 52 70 41]
 [66 73 77  3 63 37]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each item is only assigned to one agent and every agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2: Valuation 87
   - Item 5: Valuation 87
   - Total Valuation: 174

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1: Valuation 90
   - Total Valuation: 90

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0: Valuation 89
   - Total Valuation: 89

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 3: Valuation 3
   - Item 4: Valuation 63
   - Total Valuation: 66

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
