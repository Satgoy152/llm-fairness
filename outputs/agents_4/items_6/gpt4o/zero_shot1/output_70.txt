Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  34  65  75  23  15
1  20  74  24   4  25  70
2  51  83  66  36  71  35
3  29  88  21  77  48  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[39 34 65 75 23 15]
 [20 74 24  4 25 70]
 [51 83 66 36 71 35]
 [29 88 21 77 48 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the six items to the four agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible, given the number of items and agents). Here's one approach to achieve a balanced and fair allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign each agent one item that they value highly, ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent.

2. **Maximizing Total Valuation:**
   - After each agent has at least one item, allocate the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction (total value) without leaving any agent empty-handed.

Let's proceed with this approach:

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 3 (75).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 1 (74).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 1 (83), but since item 1 is already allocated, allocate item 4 (71).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 1 (88), but since item 1 is already allocated, allocate item 3 (77).

**Allocation so far:**
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [3]

### Remaining Items:
- Unallocated items: 0, 2, 5

### Further Allocation:
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 39).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 66).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 70).

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [3, 0]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [4, 2]
- Agent 3: []

This allocation ensures each item is allocated and aims to maximize total valuations for each agent.

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": []
}
```
