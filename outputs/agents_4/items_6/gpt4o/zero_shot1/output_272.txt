Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  55   2  70   3  10
1  89  52  37  89  77  35
2  69  38  56  90  20  41
3   2  54  64  80  56  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items to the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One common approach to ensuring fairness is to maximize the minimum valuation for each agent, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

- **Item 0**: Highest value for agent 1 (89).
- **Item 1**: Highest value for agent 0 (55).
- **Item 2**: Highest value for agent 3 (64).
- **Item 3**: Highest value for both agent 1 and agent 2 (89 and 90 respectively, but agent 2 doesn't have any item yet).
- **Item 4**: Highest value for agent 1 (77).
- **Item 5**: Highest value for agent 2 (41).

Allocating based on these observations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Gets item 1 (highest value for them).
- Agent 1: Gets items 0 and 4 (highest values for them).
- Agent 2: Gets items 3 and 5 (item 3 is shared with agent 1, but agent 2 needs an item and values it slightly more).
- Agent 3: Gets item 2 (highest value for them).

The allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```
