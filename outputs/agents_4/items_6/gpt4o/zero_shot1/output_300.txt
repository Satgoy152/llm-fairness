Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  78  75  83  51  86
1  44  90  73  99  74  88
2  77  99  60  46  58  92
3  23  82  39  10  35  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes total satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach is to maximize the overall sum of valuations for the items allocated to each agent. Letâ€™s go through the process step-by-step:

1. List the items and the valuations for each agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's how we can proceed:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it highest (77).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it highest (99).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it highest (75).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it highest (99).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it highest (74).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it highest (86).

Now let's compile the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 5].
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 4].
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 1].
- Agent 3 gets no items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": []
}
```
