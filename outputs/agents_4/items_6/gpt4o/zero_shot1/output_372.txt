Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  24  76  70  58   7
1  30  30   5  47  40  33
2  99  34  93  73  76  85
3  43  76  92  51  75   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider their valuations and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's look at the agent-item valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [40, 24, 76, 70, 58, 7]
Agent 1: [30, 30, 5, 47, 40, 33]
Agent 2: [99, 34, 93, 73, 76, 85]
Agent 3: [43, 76, 92, 51, 75, 3]
```

Step-by-step allocation:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value 99).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (highest value 76).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value 93).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value 70).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value 76).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value 85).

After this allocation, Agent 2 has received multiple items. To ensure fairness, we can redistribute some items to other agents who have received fewer items, aiming to balance both the number of items and their valuations.

Let's redistribute to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 also had the highest original valuation for item 1).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 had the second-highest valuation for item 0 after Agent 2).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 had the highest valuation for item 5 after Agent 2).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 1

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and items are distributed based on the highest valuations, while maintaining fairness in the number of items each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
