Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  45   1  77  55  19
1  91  90  58   9  40  14
2  44  59  45  72  39  10
3   7   6  26  36  17  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while also ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Determine an allocation that balances these valuations across agents.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 35 + 45 + 1 + 77 + 55 + 19 = 232
- Agent 1: 91 + 90 + 58 + 9 + 40 + 14 = 302
- Agent 2: 44 + 59 + 45 + 72 + 39 + 10 = 269
- Agent 3: 7 + 6 + 26 + 36 + 17 + 62 = 154

Next, we attempt to allocate the items to maximize fairness based on their valuations:

- Agent 0: Assign items 3 (value 77) and 4 (value 55) - Total value = 132
- Agent 1: Assign items 0 (value 91) and 1 (value 90) - Total value = 181
- Agent 2: Assign items 2 (value 45) and 5 (value 10) - Total value = 55
- Agent 3: Assign no items - Total value = 0

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items according to their valuations. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": []
}
```
