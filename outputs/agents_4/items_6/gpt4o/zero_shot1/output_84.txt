Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  93  50  81  11  45
1   1  52  62  80  50  27
2  27  67  69  25  77  68
3  28  73  44  68   6  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can utilize a strategy to maximize the total value for each agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Identify the item with the highest valuation for each agent and consider allocating it to them if it's not already taken.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Balance the allocation to ensure items are fairly distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 (93) and 3 (81).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 (80) and 2 (62).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 (77) and 2 (69).
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 5 (91) and 3 (68).

Considering the above, here's a proposed allocation:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining items (0 and 2) such that each agent gets at least one item:

- Item 0 can go to Agent 0, as they have a decent valuation for it.
- Item 2 can go to Agent 1, who also values it well.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their valuations, maximizing fairness and total perceived value.
