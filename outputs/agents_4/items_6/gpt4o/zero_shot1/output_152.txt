Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  88  61  53   1  74
1  73  14  93  49  57  97
2  91  18  22  19  77  56
3  68  12  81  75  61  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 88 61 53  1 74]
 [73 14 93 49 57 97]
 [91 18 22 19 77 56]
 [68 12 81 75 61 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will use a strategy to maximize the total valuation, ensuring that each agent gets at least some items if possible, and that all 6 items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (88), followed by item 0 (85).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (97), followed by item 2 (93).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (91), but it's already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 4 (77).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (81), but it's already taken by Agent 1. Next highest is item 3 (75).

Based on these valuations, we can allocate:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.

Now, the unallocated items are item 0 and item 2. Since Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 0, they receive it. For item 2, Agent 3 has the next highest valuation, so they receive it.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```
