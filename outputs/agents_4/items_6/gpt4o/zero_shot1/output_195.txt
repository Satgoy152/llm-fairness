Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  57  84   7  37  10
1  79  52  75  47  91  33
2   9  33  87  92  26  72
3  61  46  32  73  57  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 33 87 92 26 72]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total utility or value derived from the allocation. Let's analyze the given valuations and try to allocate the items accordingly.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [7, 57, 84, 7, 37, 10]
- Agent 1: [79, 52, 75, 47, 91, 33]
- Agent 2: [9, 33, 87, 92, 26, 72]
- Agent 3: [61, 46, 32, 73, 57, 47]

To make a fair allocation, we will prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most, while ensuring that each item is only allocated once. Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (84).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (91).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (92).
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (61).

Now, let's check the remaining items: 1 and 5. We will assign these based on the next highest valuations:

5. Agent 0 values item 1 (57), but Agent 1 values item 1 more (52), so let's give item 1 to Agent 0 since Agent 1 already has item 4.
6. Agent 2 values item 5 the most among the remaining agents.

Here is the final allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 1]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [3, 5]
- Agent 3: [0]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
