Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  87  49   2   9  51
1  17  57  58  67  12  16
2  59  47  18  80  93  25
3  77  36  11  88  88  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the distribution maximizes the total value across all agents. A common approach is to use an algorithmic method like the Hungarian Algorithm or a greedy approach to maximize total satisfaction or value.

Let's proceed with a simple greedy method to assign items based on maximizing each agent's total value. We'll allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, assuming no agent can receive more than their fair share of items.

Here's the allocation process:

1. Item 0: 
    - Agent 0 values it at 69
    - Agent 1 values it at 17
    - Agent 2 values it at 59
    - Agent 3 values it at 77 (highest)
    - Assign Item 0 to Agent 3

2. Item 1:
    - Agent 0 values it at 87 (highest)
    - Agent 1 values it at 57
    - Agent 2 values it at 47
    - Agent 3 values it at 36
    - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0

3. Item 2:
    - Agent 0 values it at 49
    - Agent 1 values it at 58 (highest)
    - Agent 2 values it at 18
    - Agent 3 values it at 11
    - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1

4. Item 3:
    - Agent 0 values it at 2
    - Agent 1 values it at 67
    - Agent 2 values it at 80
    - Agent 3 values it at 88 (highest)
    - Assign Item 3 to Agent 3

5. Item 4:
    - Agent 0 values it at 9
    - Agent 1 values it at 12
    - Agent 2 values it at 93 (highest)
    - Agent 3 values it at 88
    - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2

6. Item 5:
    - Agent 0 values it at 51
    - Agent 1 values it at 16
    - Agent 2 values it at 25
    - Agent 3 values it at 62 (highest)
    - Assign Item 5 to Agent 3

Now, let's present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items based on their highest valuation.
