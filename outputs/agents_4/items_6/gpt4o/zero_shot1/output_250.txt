Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  46   8  70  73   6
1  13  46  18  19  44  81
2  83  85  49  55  94  15
3  11  79  45   6  96  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 46 18 19 44 81]
 [83 85 49 55 94 15]
 [11 79 45  6 96 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

To begin, we can look for the highest valuations and try to assign those items to the corresponding agents to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's use the following approach:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. If there's an imbalance, adjust the allocation to ensure fairness.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 85, which is the highest valuation among all agents.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 85, which is the highest valuation among all agents.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it at 49, which is the highest valuation among all agents.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 70, which is the highest valuation among all agents.
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it at 96, which is the highest valuation among all agents.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 81, which is the highest valuation among all agents.

### Resulting Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 3: Item [4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, maximizing individual satisfaction for the given valuations.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
