Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  48  94  19  70  36
1  82  77  83  52  64  64
2  44  49  28   5  31  22
3  21  25  90  37  39  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. This can be achieved by assigning items to agents in a way that each agent gets the items they value the most while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2: Value 94 (highest value for Agent 0)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0: Value 82 (highest value for Agent 1)
   - Item 4: Value 64

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1: Value 49 (highest value for Agent 2)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 3: Value 37
   - Item 5: Value 28

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the agents' preferences. Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
