Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5   9  36  34  93  27
1  77  66  75   9  89  63
2  26  29   9  82   4  83
3  30  28  55  67  63  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 5  9 36 34 93 27]
 [77 66 75  9 89 63]
 [26 29  9 82  4 83]
 [30 28 55 67 63 75]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. We also want to ensure that all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent assigns to an item, then allocate that item to the agent. Prioritize agents with fewer allocations if there's a conflict.

2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, by assigning remaining items to agents with fewer items.

3. Try to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Applying these steps to the given data:

- Agent 0: Values item 4 the most (93).
- Agent 1: Values item 0 the most (77).
- Agent 2: Values item 5 the most (83).
- Agent 3: Values item 3 the most (67).

After the initial allocation based on the highest values:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [3]

Items 1 and 2 are still unallocated. To allocate these remaining items:

- Agent 0 also values item 2 (36).
- Agent 3 values item 1 (28).

Now, all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [4, 2]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [3, 1]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```
