Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  21  20  94  51  44
1  45  33  70  14  75  93
2  38  20  87  18  55  86
3  25  81  28  67  58  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, taking into account that each agent should ideally get at least one item. However, since there are 4 agents and 6 items, some agents might receive more than one item. Let's evaluate the best allocation:

First, I will determine the best item for each agent based on their highest valuation and then try to distribute the remaining items to give each agent a reasonably fair share.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value = 94)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (value = 93)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value = 87)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value = 81)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, with each agent receiving one item. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items fairly.

5. **Remaining Items: 0 and 4**

   - Assign Item 0:
     - Remaining agents: 0, 1, 2, 3
     - Highest value for Item 0 is Agent 1 (value = 45)
     - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

   - Assign Item 4:
     - Remaining agents: 0, 2, 3
     - Highest value for Item 4 is Agent 1 again (value = 75), but they already received an additional item.
     - Next highest is Agent 3 (value = 58)
     - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their valuations.
