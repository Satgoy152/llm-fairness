Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  93  14  97  13  27
1  29  37  93  20  15  87
2  50   7  26  20  49  48
3  82  52  90  23  99  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to take into account the valuations of each agent for each item. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents by trying to allocate items in a way that each agent receives items they value most. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (97).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (93).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (50).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (99).

5. With items 1 and 5 remaining, we can allocate them based on the next highest valuations while avoiding conflicts:
   - Agent 0 also values item 1 highly (93), and agent 3 values item 5 highly (88).

This allocation is designed to ensure each agent gets at least one item they value highly. Here's the allocation presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
