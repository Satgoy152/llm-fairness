Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  62  49  51  42   6
1  89  92  16  69  91  11
2  69  99  53  70  62  42
3  22  93  73  59   6  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item if possible and that all 6 items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve that:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign the item with the highest valuation for this agent.
2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, assign the item with the highest valuation for this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: Follow the same approach.
4. **Agent 3**: Follow the same approach.
5. If any items are left, distribute them to balance the allocation, considering the highest remaining valuations.

Following this approach:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0.
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1.
- **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1, but it's already taken. So we allocate the next highest available item, which is item 3.
- **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 1, but it's already taken. The next highest available item is item 2.

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- **Remaining Items**: 4 and 5

Allocate remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction:

- **Agent 1** also has high valuation for item 4.
- **Agent 2** also has high valuation for item 5.

Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
