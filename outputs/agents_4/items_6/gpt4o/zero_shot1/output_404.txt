Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  82   4  15   3  70
1  14  78   8  11  49  93
2  24  83  97  78   1  44
3  50  18  30  73  10  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize fairness by considering the preferences and values each agent assigns to the items. One way to approach this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's analyze the values and make allocations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 61
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 24
   - Agent 3 values it at 50
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 82
   - Agent 1 values it at 78
   - Agent 2 values it at 83
   - Agent 3 values it at 18
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 4
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   - Agent 3 values it at 30
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 15
   - Agent 1 values it at 11
   - Agent 2 values it at 78
   - Agent 3 values it at 73
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 3
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Agent 2 values it at 1
   - Agent 3 values it at 10
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 70
   - Agent 1 values it at 93
   - Agent 2 values it at 44
   - Agent 3 values it at 36
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Agent 3 currently has no items, and Agent 2 has three. We will reallocate one item from Agent 2 to Agent 3 to balance the distribution more fairly.

Reassign Item 3 from Agent 2 to Agent 3 since Agent 3 has a high valuation for it.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 6.
