Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  55  36  41  59  58
1  22  63  54  21   2  14
2  71  77  31  81  85   3
3  60  13  16  32  21   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 55 36 41 59 58]
 [22 63 54 21  2 14]
 [71 77 31 81 85  3]
 [60 13 16 32 21  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. We will use the valuations given in the table to guide the allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 99 by Agent 0. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 77 by Agent 2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 54 by Agent 1. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 81 by Agent 2. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 85 by Agent 2. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: The highest remaining value is 58 by Agent 0. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.
- Agent 2 receives Items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 3 receives no items based on the allocation strategy.

### JSON Format Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3, 4],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and the distribution is made in a way to maximize the individual valuations for the agents.
