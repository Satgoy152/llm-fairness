Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  22   5  54  25  35
1  69  64   5  77  50  68
2   8  36  88  46  80  37
3  76  48  55  25  97  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44 22  5 54 25 35]
 [69 64  5 77 50 68]
 [ 8 36 88 46 80 37]
 [76 48 55 25 97 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will analyze the valuations and assign items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (54), Item 0 (44)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (77), Item 0 (69)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (88), Item 4 (80)
   
4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (97), Item 0 (76)

Now, let's allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's received value:

- **Item 0:** Allocate to Agent 3 (value 76, higher compared to other agents' need for other items)
- **Item 1:** Allocate to Agent 2 (value 36, as Agent 2 needs more items)
- **Item 2:** Allocate to Agent 2 (value 88, highest possible allocation)
- **Item 3:** Allocate to Agent 1 (value 77, highest value for Agent 1)
- **Item 4:** Allocate to Agent 3 (value 97, highest value overall)
- **Item 5:** Allocate to Agent 0 (value 35, to ensure Agent 0 gets at least one item)

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
