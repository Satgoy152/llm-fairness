Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  67  10  55  66  54
1  23  13   7  60  68  63
2   2  49  74  65  13  26
3  31  14  47  60  21  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 49 74 65 13 26]
 [31 14 47 60 21 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider how to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are allocated. This might involve balancing the allocation based on each agent's preferences.

Let's consider each agent's highest-valued items and attempt to allocate items accordingly:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (85) and item 1 the second highest (67).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (68) and item 3 the second highest (60).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (74) and item 3 the second highest (65).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (60) and item 5 the second highest (48).

Given these preferences, here is one way to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 (highest value for Agent 1).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 (highest value for Agent 3).

Now we have to allocate the remaining items 1 and 5:

- Item 1 is the second highest for Agent 0, so let's assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Item 5 is the second highest for Agent 3, so let's assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Now we have allocated all items, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share given their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
