Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  32  66   2  23  16
1  22  77  60  64   0  35
2  84  95  23  12  47  45
3  59  88  96  58  52  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, provided that the agent has not already received an item.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 70.
   - Agent 1 values it at 22.
   - Agent 2 values it at 84.
   - Agent 3 values it at 59.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 32.
   - Agent 1 values it at 77.
   - Agent 2 values it at 95.
   - Agent 3 values it at 88.
   - Assign to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 has already received an item, assign to the next highest, Agent 3).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 66.
   - Agent 1 values it at 60.
   - Agent 2 values it at 23.
   - Agent 3 values it at 96.
   - Assign to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 has already received an item, assign to the next highest, Agent 0).

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 2.
   - Agent 1 values it at 64.
   - Agent 2 values it at 12.
   - Agent 3 values it at 58.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 23.
   - Agent 1 values it at 0.
   - Agent 2 values it at 47.
   - Agent 3 values it at 52.
   - Assign to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 has already received an item, assign to the next highest, Agent 2).

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 16.
   - Agent 1 values it at 35.
   - Agent 2 values it at 45.
   - Agent 3 values it at 69.
   - Assign to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 has already received an item, assign to the next highest, Agent 2).

Now, let's ensure every agent gets at least one item, and then finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]
- Agent 3: [1, 5]

Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

Each agent has received an item, and all items have been allocated.
