Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  38  70  89  97  54
1  65  64   1   5  95   0
2  72  65  38  17  60   6
3  59   3  97  61   2  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their given valuations. We can use a greedy approach where we assign items to agents based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's how the allocation might look:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (97), Item 0 (93), Item 3 (89)
   - Allocate Item 4 and Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (95), Item 0 (65), Item 1 (64)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (since Item 4 and Item 0 are already allocated).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (72), Item 1 (65), Item 4 (60)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2 (Item 0 and Item 1 are already allocated).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (97), Item 3 (61), Item 5 (60)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3 (Item 2 is already allocated).

5. **Unallocated Items**:
   - Items 5 remains unallocated.
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2, as they have the highest remaining valuation for it.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives a number of items that maximizes their total valuation. Note that while Agent 1 only receives one item, they receive an item with a higher relative value to them compared to available options.
