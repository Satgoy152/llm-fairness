Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12   6  72  10  50  90
1  14   1  70  49  87  37
2  38  12  14  48  98  79
3  47  64  48  31  33  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly. Let's go through each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0: 12
   - Agent 1: 14 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2: 38 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 3: 47 (highest valuation)
   - Allocate to Agent 3.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0: 6
   - Agent 1: 1
   - Agent 2: 12
   - Agent 3: 64 (highest valuation)
   - Allocate to Agent 3.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0: 72 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 1: 70
   - Agent 2: 14
   - Agent 3: 48
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0: 10
   - Agent 1: 49 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2: 48
   - Agent 3: 31
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0: 50
   - Agent 1: 87 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2: 98 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 3: 33
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0: 90 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 1: 37
   - Agent 2: 79
   - Agent 3: 87
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

After performing these allocations, we ensure that each agent has an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 2 and 5, Agent 1 receives item 3, Agent 2 receives item 4, and Agent 3 receives items 0 and 1.
