Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  47  91  10  69  43
1  49  96  53   2  15  75
2  37  60  95  15  29   8
3  84  74  40  27  28  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations. We also need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly six.

Let's consider a strategy where we try to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction and ensures fairness. We can start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent step by step, ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (91), so we assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (96), so we assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 2, but since it's already allocated, we assign them their next highest value, item 0 (37).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 0 (84), but since it's already allocated, we assign them their next highest valued unallocated item, item 5 (81).
5. Since agents 0, 1, 2, and 3 have items, we can now fairly distribute the remaining items considering the values.
6. Agent 0 can receive item 4 (69), and Agent 1 can take item 3 (2), based on their remaining highest preferences.

Based on this, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the allocations are based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations.
