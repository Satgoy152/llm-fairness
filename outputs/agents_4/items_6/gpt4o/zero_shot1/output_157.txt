Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  15  93  14  34  75
1  22  67  33  39  38  50
2  24  85  33  21  18  30
3  86  75  85  60  29  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible), and all items are allocated. We will use a greedy approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, as long as it doesn't leave any agent without an item.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Start by examining the highest valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 86.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 85.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 60.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 38.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 75.

2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 and Item 5
   - Agent 1: Item 4
   - Agent 2: Item 1
   - Agent 3: Item 0 and Item 3

3. Check that each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Adjust if necessary.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
