Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  85  53  71   9  92
1  88  42  14  99  24  73
2  50  73  66  69  96  99
3  54   0   2  23  11  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87 85 53 71  9 92]
 [88 42 14 99 24 73]
 [50 73 66 69 96 99]
 [54  0  2 23 11 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. Calculate the maximum value each agent gives to each item.
2. Allocate items based on the highest valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's go through the table and allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 92.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 99.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 99, but since Agent 0 has already claimed item 5, let's consider the next highest value, which is item 4 at 96.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 83, but since Agent 0 has already claimed item 5, let's consider the next highest value, which is item 0 at 54.

Now we have:

- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (1, 2):

- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 42, Agent 2 at 73, and Agent 3 at 0. The highest value is from Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 14, Agent 2 at 66, and Agent 3 at 2. The highest value is from Agent 2.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 5 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 4 and 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.

Thus, the fair allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [0]
}
```
