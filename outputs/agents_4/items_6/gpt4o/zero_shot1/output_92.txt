Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  70   2   8  76  80
1  51  65  98  39   0  54
2  78  19  89   5  30  85
3  82  12  98  90  92  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for a distribution that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent has at least one item if possible. We have 4 agents and 6 items, so some agents will have more items than others. Let's try to allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: This agent values items 0, 1, 4, and 5 quite highly. 
- Agent 1: This agent values item 2 the most.
- Agent 2: This agent values items 2 and 5 highly.
- Agent 3: This agent values items 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 highly.

Given these valuations, a fair allocation could look like this:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 82), as it's the highest value for that item across all agents.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 70), as it is the highest value for that item across all agents.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 98), as it is the highest value for that item across all agents.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 90), as it is the highest value for that item across all agents.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 92), as it is the highest value for that item across all agents.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 85), as it is the highest value for that item across all agents.

Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent while maximizing the total value each agent receives. Agent 0 receives item 1, Agent 1 receives item 2, Agent 2 receives item 5, and Agent 3 receives items 0, 3, and 4.
