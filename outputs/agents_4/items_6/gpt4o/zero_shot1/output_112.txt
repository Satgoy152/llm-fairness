Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  44  45  51   8  80
1   2  31  98  28  92  11
2  25  57  39  77  62  41
3  97  37  56  90  63  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated. Let's try to allocate based on the highest value each agent places on the items.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 3** highly values item 0 with a valuation of 97. Allocate item 0 to agent 3.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 with a valuation of 98. Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 3** also values item 3 with a valuation of 90. Allocate item 3 to agent 3.
4. **Agent 1** values item 4 with a valuation of 92. Allocate item 4 to agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** highly values item 5 with a valuation of 80. Allocate item 5 to agent 0.
6. **Agent 2** has item 1 left with a valuation of 57. Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This distribution ensures a fair allocation based on the valuations provided.
