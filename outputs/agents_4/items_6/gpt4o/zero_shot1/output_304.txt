Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  16  86  32  28  74
1  78  67  97  47  67  58
2  81  72   6  55  21  38
3  46  89  23  26   1  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to approach it:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Adjust the allocations to ensure all items are distributed.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest (81).
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it the highest (89).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest (97).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the highest (47), but since Agent 1 already has an item, we will reconsider later.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest (67), but since Agent 1 already has an item, we will reconsider later.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest (74).

Now, let's adjust to ensure all agents have items and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 has item 5.
- Agent 1 has item 2.
- Agent 2 has item 0.
- Agent 3 has item 1.

Now allocate items 3 and 4:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 as Agent 0 values it second highest after Agent 1, and Agent 0 has only one item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 as Agent 2 values it more than Agent 3, and Agent 2 has only one item.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

Each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated fairly.
