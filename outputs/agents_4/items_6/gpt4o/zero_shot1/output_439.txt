Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  93  64   0  62  74
1  68  20  97  15  12  48
2  26  69  56  25  67  90
3  64  25  90  62  22  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that the distribution is equitable. One possible approach is to consider each agent's highest valued items and allocate accordingly, ensuring that each agent receives some value.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Their highest-valued items are 1 (93) and 5 (74).
2. **Agent 1**: Their highest-valued items are 2 (97) and 0 (68).
3. **Agent 2**: Their highest-valued items are 5 (90) and 4 (67).
4. **Agent 3**: Their highest-valued items are 2 (90) and 3 (62).

Let's attempt a distribution based on these preferences:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 1.
- Agent 1: Allocate item 2.
- Agent 2: Allocate item 5.
- Agent 3: Allocate items 3 and 0.
- To balance the allocation, we need to allocate item 4 to one of the agents. We can give item 4 to Agent 2, as they have a high valuation for it.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their valuations, with an attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation.
