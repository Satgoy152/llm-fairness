Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  86  91  42  69  55
1  22  87  50   0  73  46
2  46  92  55  37  64  63
3  69  57  33  43  26  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common approach is to use a form of the maximum weight matching algorithm to find an optimal allocation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. Ideally, we'd want to give them at least one of these items.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1. However, since item 1 is highly valued by both agents 0 and 1, we'll try to allocate it to the agent who benefits the most from other items as well.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1 and item 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 doesnâ€™t have any particularly high valuations, but we still need to allocate items fairly.

Considering these factors, here is one possible allocation:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their individual valuations where possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
