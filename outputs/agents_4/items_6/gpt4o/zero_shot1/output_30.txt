Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  34  15  79  99  81
1  26  96  37  89  56  45
2  63  16  53  87  27  50
3  68  73  88  40  13  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent has for the items. We also need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and we distribute all six items.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

1. Agent 0's highest values are for items 4 (99) and 5 (81).
2. Agent 1's highest values are for items 1 (96) and 3 (89).
3. Agent 2's highest value is for item 3 (87), but Agent 1 values it higher. So, we should consider items 0 (63) and 2 (53) for Agent 2.
4. Agent 3's highest value is for item 2 (88), which is better suited than Agent 2's value for the same item.

Let's allocate based on these observations:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 99) and item 5 to Agent 0 (value 81).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 96) and item 3 to Agent 1 (value 89).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 63).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value 88).

This way, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```
