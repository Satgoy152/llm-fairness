Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  29  63  64  30  82
1  75  86  57  10  45  77
2  55  12  78  10  40  26
3  75   0  33  10  10  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 12 78 10 40 26]
 [75  0 33 10 10 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 87
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 63
  - Item 3: 64
  - Item 4: 30
  - Item 5: 82

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 57
  - Item 3: 10
  - Item 4: 45
  - Item 5: 77

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 78
  - Item 3: 10
  - Item 4: 40
  - Item 5: 26

- Agent 3 values:
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 10
  - Item 4: 10
  - Item 5: 96

Analyzing these values, we should allocate items to maximize the total value each agent receives:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, because they value it highest at 87.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, because they value it highest at 86.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2, because they value it highest at 78.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as they have a relatively high value for it at 64.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1, since their valuation is reasonably high at 45.
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 3, as they value it highest at 96.

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one item, maximizing their satisfaction based on their preferences.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5]
}
```
