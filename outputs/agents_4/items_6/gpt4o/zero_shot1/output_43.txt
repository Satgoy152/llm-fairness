Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  53  70  58  70  71
1  95  98  53  25  80  74
2  37   9  72  36  59   0
3  99  18  24  37  80  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 9 53 70 58 70 71]
 [95 98 53 25 80 74]
 [37  9 72 36 59  0]
 [99 18 24 37 80 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item individually to the agent who values it the most. If two agents value an item equally, we can choose one of them arbitrarily.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: The valuations are [9, 95, 37, 99]. Agent 3 values it the most with a valuation of 99.
- Item 1: The valuations are [53, 98, 9, 18]. Agent 1 values it the most with a valuation of 98.
- Item 2: The valuations are [70, 53, 72, 24]. Agent 2 values it the most with a valuation of 72.
- Item 3: The valuations are [58, 25, 36, 37]. Agent 3 values it the most with a valuation of 37.
- Item 4: The valuations are [70, 80, 59, 80]. Agents 1 and 3 both value it at 80. We can assign it to Agent 1.
- Item 5: The valuations are [71, 74, 0, 26]. Agent 1 values it the most with a valuation of 74.

2. Allocate the items based on these valuations:

- Agent 0: No items are allocated.
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, and 5 are allocated.
- Agent 2: Item 2 is allocated.
- Agent 3: Items 0 and 3 are allocated.

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
