Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  53  91  99   0  74
1  36  19  74  89  59  58
2  61   4   4  28  28  91
3  58   3  18  43  83   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 53 91 99  0 74]
 [36 19 74 89 59 58]
 [61  4  4 28 28 91]
 [58  3 18 43 83  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the table to find a fair allocation:

1. **Identify highest valuations for each item**: 
    - Item 0: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (61).
    - Item 1: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (53, tied with agent 0, but we can choose one).
    - Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (91).
    - Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (99).
    - Item 4: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (83).
    - Item 5: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (91).

2. **Allocate based on the highest valuation**: 
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 2, and 3
   - Agent 1: No items have the highest valuation by this agent.
   - Agent 2: Items 0 and 5
   - Agent 3: Item 4

3. **Verify all items are allocated and each agent is included**:
   - All items (0-5) are accounted for in the allocation.
   - Each agent is considered in the allocation list, even if they receive no items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
