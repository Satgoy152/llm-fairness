Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  67  52  91  76  11
1  86  68  81  10  42  90
2  40  90  94  76  58  39
3  31  55  25  43  80  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the distribution maximizes overall satisfaction while respecting the constraint of distributing all 6 items. One common approach is to use a method like maximizing the total valuation or using techniques such as the Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems. However, given the simplicity of this problem (only 6 items and 4 agents), a heuristic approach can also be effective.

Here is a potential fair allocation:

1. Start by trying to give each agent their highest valued item.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed and no agent is left without an item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: highest value in item 3 (91)
- Agent 1: highest value in item 0 (86)
- Agent 2: highest value in item 2 (94)
- Agent 3: highest value in item 4 (80)

Now, let's allocate these items to each agent based on their highest value and adjust accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 3
2. **Agent 1**: Item 0
3. **Agent 2**: Item 2
4. **Agent 3**: Item 4

Items 1 and 5 are left. We need to allocate these remaining items:

- For item 1, Agent 2 values it the highest (90), but Agent 0 can also be considered since they already have 1 item.
- For item 5, Agent 1 values it the highest (90).

Let's finalize the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 1]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: [4]

This allocation ensures all agents receive items and attempts to maximize individual agent satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
