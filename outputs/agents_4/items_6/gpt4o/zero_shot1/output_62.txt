Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  92  30  11  18   4
1  46  72  72   4  64  79
2  65  48  50  62  55  70
3  86  64  36  51  49  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74 92 30 11 18  4]
 [46 72 72  4 64 79]
 [65 48 50 62 55 70]
 [86 64 36 51 49 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations table and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will aim to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations to maximize satisfaction.

Here's the given valuation table for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  92  30  11  18   4
1  46  72  72   4  64  79
2  65  48  50  62  55  70
3  86  64  36  51  49  34
```

Let's look for the highest valuation for each item and allocate it to that agent if possible:

1. Item 0: The highest value is 86 (Agent 3).
2. Item 1: The highest value is 92 (Agent 0).
3. Item 2: The highest value is 72 (Agent 1).
4. Item 3: The highest value is 62 (Agent 2).
5. Item 4: The highest value is 64 (Agent 1).
6. Item 5: The highest value is 79 (Agent 1).

Now, we will check and adjust to ensure each agent gets a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 2, Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 3, Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 0

Let's verify that this allocation respects fairness and the total number of items allocated:

Agent allocations:
- Agent 0: 1 item
- Agent 1: 2 items
- Agent 2: 2 items
- Agent 3: 1 item

This results in a total of 6 items allocated, meeting the requirement. The allocation satisfies fairness by giving each agent a chance to get items with high valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
