Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  77  61  19  71  68
1  92  10  93  53  28   0
2  42  10  75  75  67  52
3  62  43  60  18  97  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items allocated to them. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List each agent's highest valued items**:
   - Agent 0: [1, 4, 5]
   - Agent 1: [0, 2, 3]
   - Agent 2: [2, 3, 4]
   - Agent 3: [4, 5, 0]

2. **Ensure each item is allocated only once**:
   - Start with the highest value assignments for each agent and adjust to prevent overlaps, trying to maximize the value.

3. **Allocate items**:
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (77), Item 5 (68)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (92), Item 2 (93)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (75)
   - Agent 3: Item 4 (97)

4. **Check and adjust to ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share**:
   - Ensure all items [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] are allocated.
   - Adjust if necessary, but in this scenario, the allocation is optimal as is.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
