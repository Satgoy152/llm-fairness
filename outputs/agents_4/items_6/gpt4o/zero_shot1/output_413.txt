Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  52  20   6  13  95
1  47   8  81  68  46  12
2  65  45  11  91  62  36
3  70  77  52  68  84  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 45 11 91 62 36]
 [70 77 52 68 84 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation that each agent has for the items they receive. This can involve assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

Let's go through the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 5 (95).
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2 (81).
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3 (91).
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4 (84).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

5. Agent 3 also has a high valuation for item 1 (77).
6. Agent 2 can take item 0 (65).

Now each agent gets an item they highly value, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, and all 6 items are allocated.
