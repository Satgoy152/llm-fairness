Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  48  58  80  42  61
1   0  12  99   9  13  84
2  65   7  36  27  31  61
3  64  65  94  92  61  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 9 48 58 80 42 61]
 [ 0 12 99  9 13 84]
 [65  7 36 27 31 61]
 [64 65 94 92 61 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and each item is allocated to only one agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Item 3 is the best option for Agent 0 with a value of 80.
   
2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Item 2 is the best option for Agent 1 with a value of 99.
   
3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Item 0 is the best option for Agent 2 with a value of 65.
   
4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Item 4 is a good option with a value of 61 for Agent 3.
   - Item 5 is also a good option for Agent 3 with a value of 62.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (Item 1) to an agent that can utilize it best without disturbing the current allocations:

- **Agent 3** can take Item 1 as well, since Agent 3 values it quite high (65), and it doesn't interfere with anyone else's allocation.

Here's the json format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated at least one item, and all 6 items have been fairly distributed.
