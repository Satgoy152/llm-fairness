Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  39  71  28  83   8
1  12  12  61  16  31  37
2  75  43  90  33  65  20
3  12  23  57  11  87  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. Here is a possible allocation method:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: Start by identifying which items hold the highest value for each agent.
2. **Assign items to maximize total valuation**: Allocate items to agents to maximize their total valuation while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent.
3. **Check for fairness**: Ensure that no agent receives a disproportionate number of high-value items, if possible.

Let's evaluate the allocations:

Agent 0's preferences are highest for items: 4, 2, and 0.
Agent 1's preferences are highest for items: 2, 5, and 4.
Agent 2's preferences are highest for items: 2, 0, and 4.
Agent 3's preferences are highest for items: 4, 5, and 2.

Based on this, we can proceed with the following allocation:

- Allocate item 4 to agent 0, as it's their highest preference and has a high score compared to others.
- Allocate item 2 to agent 2, as it's their highest preference and has a high score compared to others.
- Allocate item 0 to agent 2, since it is their second highest preference and keeps the total allocations fair.
- Allocate item 5 to agent 3, as it has a relatively high preference for them.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 0, as it fulfills their need for a second item.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 1, as it is their next best option.

This distribution ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuation preferences.

Here is the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 6 items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and attempts to maximize the total valuation for each participant.
