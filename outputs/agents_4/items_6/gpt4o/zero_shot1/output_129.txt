Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  38  46  51  67  87
1  39  73  75   0  48  14
2  75  78  34  75  38  40
3  67  28  43  48  86  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total value for each agent based on their individual valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Given the item values, Agent 0 values item 5 the most at 87. So, allocate item 5 to Agent 0. Next highest is item 4 with a value of 67, but we need to check other agents' higher priorities.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 75. So, allocate item 2 to Agent 1. Next highest is item 1 with a value of 73.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 78. So, allocate item 1 to Agent 2. Next highest is item 0 with a value of 75.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 the most at 86. So, allocate item 4 to Agent 3. Next highest is item 0 with a value of 67.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and need to allocate 2 more. To ensure fairness, let's allocate the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 3 (value 51) to Agent 0, as it's their next highest priority.

6. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (value 75) to Agent 2, as it benefits them significantly.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance high-value items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations.
