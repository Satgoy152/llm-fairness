Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59   4   5  30  81  34
1  75   6  59  32  70  34
2  54  94  35  33  44  70
3  51   9  77  38  21  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: Start by identifying the items each agent values the most.

2. **Consider item uniqueness**: If a specific item is highly valued by only one agent, it's optimal to allocate that item to that agent.

3. **Balance allocations**: Ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

4. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Verify that every item is given out and no agent receives more than their fair share.

Let's allocate the items based on these principles:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4 (81).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (75).
- Agent 2 highly values item 1 (94).
- Agent 3 highly values item 5 (78).

Now, let's make the allocations while ensuring fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4
- **Agent 1**: Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Item 1
- **Agent 3**: Item 5

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 3 (77), so assign it to Agent 3.
- Item 3 is fairly valued by Agent 2 (33), so assign it to Agent 2.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 3: Items 5 and 2

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5, 2]
}
```
