Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  65  84  21   7   6
1  37  96  28  65  90  82
2  71  56  86  60  27  57
3  17  50  52  88  47  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. A common approach is to use a method like the "greedy algorithm" for initial allocations and then make adjustments to ensure fairness.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring each item is only assigned once.

2. **Adjustment:**
   - If any agent has no items, adjust the allocation by transferring items with the least impact on the total valuation fairness.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 2 (84).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 1 (96).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 2 (86), but it's already taken; next highest is item 0 (71).
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 3 (88).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 4 and 5.

- **Agent 1**: The next highest valuation is for item 4 (90).
- **Agent 2**: The next highest valuation is for item 5 (57).

This leaves Agent 0 with only one item. To balance, we can adjust:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 and 5.
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 4.
- **Agent 2**: Item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Item 3.

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item and tries to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
