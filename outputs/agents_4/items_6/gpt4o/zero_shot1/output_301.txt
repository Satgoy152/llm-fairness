Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25   3  68  85  48  73
1  52  76  91   1  23  37
2  35  51  27  58   9  14
3  71  27  93  57  90  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent has a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Find the highest valued items for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (85).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (91).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (58).
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (93).

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations without conflict**:
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0. 
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (since Agent 2 has an overlap on item 3 and Agent 0 already took item 3).

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance the distribution**:
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (next highest value 73).
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (next highest value 76).
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (next highest value 9).

Now, let's list the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes their respective valuations to the extent possible while ensuring exactly 6 items are distributed.
