Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  75  13  37  88  45
1  39   9  98  25  70  31
2  61  64  40  87  90  77
3  11  41  77  32  25  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their preferences. One approach is to assign items in such a way that each agent receives items with higher personal valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated and no agent is left without an item.

Let's begin by examining the highest values for each agent and try to distribute items based on these preferences:

Agent 0's highest values:
- Item 4 (88)
- Item 1 (75)

Agent 1's highest values:
- Item 2 (98)
- Item 4 (70)

Agent 2's highest values:
- Item 4 (90)
- Item 3 (87)

Agent 3's highest values:
- Item 2 (77)
- Item 1 (41)

To ensure fairness, we can allocate items by allowing each agent to receive at least one of their top-valued items while trying to maximize their total sum of valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 because it is their highest value and relatively high for others as well.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because it is their highest value.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it is their next highest after item 4.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest value.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 3, since it is not a top choice for others.
6. Finally, assign item 0 to Agent 0 to ensure all items are allocated.

Here's how the allocation looks:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 5

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items based on their highest valuations.
