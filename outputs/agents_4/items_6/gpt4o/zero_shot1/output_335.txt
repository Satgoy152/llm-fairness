Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  11  67  72  59  36
1  76  46  17  14  40  53
2  75  39  64  65  47  94
3  18  33  30  25  77  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 11 67 72 59 36]
 [76 46 17 14 40 53]
 [75 39 64 65 47 94]
 [18 33 30 25 77 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent's allocation while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [94, 11, 67, 72, 59, 36]
- Agent 1: [76, 46, 17, 14, 40, 53]
- Agent 2: [75, 39, 64, 65, 47, 94]
- Agent 3: [18, 33, 30, 25, 77, 33]

We will now allocate the items based on maximizing the valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is for Agent 0 (94).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is for Agent 1 (46).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is for Agent 0 (67).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is for Agent 0 (72).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is for Agent 3 (77).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is for Agent 2 (94).

With these allocations, we ensure that each item goes to the agent who values it the most, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
