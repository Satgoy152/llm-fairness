Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  24  43  98  73   3
1   6  97  52  52   5  70
2  12  58  84  58  95  46
3  71  69  81  18  97  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 24 43 98 73  3]
 [ 6 97 52 52  5 70]
 [12 58 84 58 95 46]
 [71 69 81 18 97 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we can consider the valuations given in the table and aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest with a valuation of 98.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - After item 3 has been allocated, Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 with a value of 97.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 with a value of 95.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 with a value of 71.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items (2 and 5):**
   - For item 2:
     - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest with a valuation of 84.
     - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

   - For item 5:
     - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest with a valuation of 70.
     - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
