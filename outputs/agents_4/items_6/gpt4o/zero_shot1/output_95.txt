Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  18  62  60  83  98
1  30  37  98  62  74  70
2  16  21  74  55  31  30
3  34  36   0  99   7  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 18 62 60 83 98]
 [30 37 98 62 74 70]
 [16 21 74 55 31 30]
 [34 36  0 99  7 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method where each agent gets items based on their highest valuations to ensure fairness and maximize the total valuation. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high values for items 4 and 5, so we can assign these items to them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most, so we can assign it to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has relatively low valuations, but values item 3 the most among their options, so we can assign it to them.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 and item 0 more compared to other agents, so we can assign these items to them.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
