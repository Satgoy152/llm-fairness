Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  58   2  30  35  40
1   8  87  87  73  91  51
2  35  31  25  84  89  62
3  50  27  35  88  67  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each gets an approximately equal number of items. Given there are 4 agents and 6 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Gets items that have relatively higher values for them compared to other agents.
2. **Agent 1**: As they have high values for items 1 and 4, these items could be allocated to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items where their values are significant compared to others.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate remaining items, balancing the total number of items distributed.

Let's execute an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 5 (values 57 and 40 respectively).
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 1 and 4 (values 87 and 91).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (value 84).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 2 (value 35).

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on the highest relative value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

The allocations in the specified JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```
