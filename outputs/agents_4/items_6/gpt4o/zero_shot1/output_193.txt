Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  65  89  50  73  74
1  36  63  21  44   5  63
2  13  53  73  15  89  89
3  89  75  84  24  53  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we will try to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, where possible. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 5.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highly.

With these considerations, the allocation can be made as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.
- Agent 3 receives items 2, 3, and 5, ensuring they also receive highly valued items.

This allocation tries to balance the overall satisfaction while respecting the constraint that only one agent can receive each item. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
