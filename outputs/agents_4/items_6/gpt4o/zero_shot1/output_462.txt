Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  90  35  14  32  54
1  10   3  84   0  71  48
2  49  32  22  27  21  16
3  88  47  96  30  80  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets an appropriate share based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assess how to distribute items such that the total value is balanced across agents.
3. Ensure each agent receives items according to their preferences while respecting the total number of items available.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 54 + 90 + 35 + 14 + 32 + 54 = 279
- Agent 1: 10 + 3 + 84 + 0 + 71 + 48 = 216
- Agent 2: 49 + 32 + 22 + 27 + 21 + 16 = 167
- Agent 3: 88 + 47 + 96 + 30 + 80 + 51 = 392

Based on these valuations, it seems that Agent 3 values the items most highly, followed by Agent 0, Agent 1, and finally Agent 2. We should aim to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's proceed with a fair allocation:

- Assign the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.
  
Here's a fair allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 since it is highly valued (84).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 since it balances their total valuation (27).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 for their highest value (88).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 for their high value (90).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 for their next high value (80).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 for their balanced value (54).

Now that the items are allocated, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.
