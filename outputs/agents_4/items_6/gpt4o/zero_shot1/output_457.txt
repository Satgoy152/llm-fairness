Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  85  10  98  15  59
1  76  64  29  79  83  62
2   9  20  67  54  16  80
3  21  41  25  63  69  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 20 67 54 16 80]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation for each item and aim to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. However, since each agent can only receive an integer number of items, we must ensure that each agent receives an appropriate share based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 98.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 76.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 80.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 69.

We'll start by assigning the highest valued item to each agent:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

After these assignments, we have allocated 4 out of the 6 items. We still need to allocate items 1 and 2. Let's consider the next highest valuations:

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 85.
  - Agent 1 values it at 64.
  - Agent 3 values it at 41.

Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

- Item 2:
  - Agent 2 values it at 67.
  - Agent 1 values it at 29.
  - Agent 3 values it at 25.

Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now we have allocated all 6 items. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
