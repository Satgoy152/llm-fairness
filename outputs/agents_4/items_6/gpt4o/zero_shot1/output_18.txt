Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  71  62  50  46  42
1  72  52  21  40  19  61
2  18  29  93  15  43  80
3  81  26  98  92  39  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 26 98 92 39 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider trying to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of allocated items is exactly 6. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 1, and 2. Let's consider giving them item 0, which has the highest value for them.
2. Agent 1 has a relatively high value for item 5. Let's allocate item 5 to them.
3. Agent 2 has a very high value for item 2, so it's beneficial to allocate item 2 to them.
4. Agent 3 has high values for items 3 and 4. Let's allocate items 3 and 4 to them.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives item 5.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives items 3 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items based on their valuations. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
