Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  79  64  49  61  88
1  55  31   1  75  90  77
2  93  98  27   8  27  15
3  83   8  69  38  98  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all six items are distributed. We will evaluate different allocation scenarios to achieve this balance.

Let's start by considering each agent's highest valuations and how we can distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 5 (88), 1 (79), and 2 (64).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 (90), 3 (75), and 0 (55).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1 (98), 0 (93), and 2 (27).
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 4 (98), 0 (83), and 2 (69).

Given these preferences, let's try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it holds the highest value for them.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it holds the highest value for them.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it holds the highest value for them.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3, as it holds a high value for them.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it holds a high value and balances the allocation.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it holds a high value and completes their allocation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their valuations based on the given preferences.
