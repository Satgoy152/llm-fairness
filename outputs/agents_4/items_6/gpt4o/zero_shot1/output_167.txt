Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  24  20  24  63  52
1  14  73  15  95  45  24
2  85  67  39  47  67  73
3  68  98   0  28  84  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 73 15 95 45 24]
 [85 67 39 47 67 73]
 [68 98  0 28 84 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we can use the idea of maximizing each agent's utility based on their valuations. The goal is to assign items such that the overall satisfaction of all agents is as high as possible, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: 79, 24, 20, 24, 63, 52
- Agent 1: 14, 73, 15, 95, 45, 24
- Agent 2: 85, 67, 39, 47, 67, 73
- Agent 3: 68, 98, 0, 28, 84, 78

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 85 (Agent 2)
2. Item 1: Highest value is 98 (Agent 3)
3. Item 2: Highest value is 39 (Agent 2)
4. Item 3: Highest value is 95 (Agent 1)
5. Item 4: Highest value is 84 (Agent 3)
6. Item 5: Highest value is 78 (Agent 3)

Now, we will verify if this allocation is fair and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0 receives: 0 items
- Agent 1 receives: Item 3
- Agent 2 receives: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 3 receives: Items 1, 4, and 5

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items, while respecting the highest valuations.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
