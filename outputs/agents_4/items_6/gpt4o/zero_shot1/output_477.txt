Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  90  90  63   0  69
1  26  19  87  41   2  34
2   0   0  27   2  43  26
3  36  54  85   3  26  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 90 90 63  0 69]
 [26 19 87 41  2 34]
 [ 0  0 27  2 43 26]
 [36 54 85  3 26 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the items are distributed in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the valuations. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (90), followed by item 2 (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (87).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (43).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for items 2 and 5 (85).

Given these valuations, the allocations can be made as follows:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, we have 2 items left to allocate: items 0 and 3.

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (valuation 85).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (valuation 41).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and that the distribution is fairly based on the valuations. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
