Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  58  60  68  11  17
1   1  93  47  77  42  77
2  91   8  15  27  36  69
3   2  14  54  55  34  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 58 60 68 11 17]
 [ 1 93 47 77 42 77]
 [91  8 15 27 36 69]
 [ 2 14 54 55 34 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring a balanced distribution. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (93), Item 3 (68)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (93), Item 3 (77), Item 5 (77)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (91), Item 5 (69)
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (54), Item 3 (55)

A possible allocation that maximizes total valuation while distributing all items is:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0
- **Agent 1**: Item 1, Item 5
- **Agent 2**: Item 3
- **Agent 3**: Item 2, Item 4

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the total utility based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
