Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  95   1  57  58  62
1   0  80  77  42  53  31
2  84  78  90  25  91  18
3  93   4  16   1  23  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. We can use a simple method by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 90.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 57, agent 1 at 42, agent 2 at 25, and agent 3 at 1. 
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 since Agent 0 already has two items and Agent 1 values it the most after that.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 91.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 62, agent 1 at 31, agent 2 at 18, and agent 3 at 20. 
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 3 to ensure they receive at least one item.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, except Agent 1 who ends up with one item, and maximizes the overall valuation.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
