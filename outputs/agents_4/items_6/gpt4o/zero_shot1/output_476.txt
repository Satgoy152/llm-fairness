Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  46  55  11   7  29
1  95  56  45  35  92  92
2  32  64  39  71  38  98
3   6  37  23  55  68  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One possible approach to achieve this is to use a greedy strategy or similar heuristic to distribute the items based on the valuations.

Let's evaluate the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [12, 46, 55, 11, 7, 29]
- Agent 1: [95, 56, 45, 35, 92, 92]
- Agent 2: [32, 64, 39, 71, 38, 98]
- Agent 3: [6, 37, 23, 55, 68, 14]

We can allocate items by considering the highest value an agent assigns to an item, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as they value it the highest at 95.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they value it the highest at 64.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as they value it the highest at 55.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as they value it the highest at 71.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3, as they value it the highest at 68.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as they value it the highest at 98.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
