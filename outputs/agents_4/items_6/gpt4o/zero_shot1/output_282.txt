Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83   7  90  10  79   7
1  11   6  53  43  79  23
2  58  72  27  94  32  20
3   6   6  48  48  49   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83  7 90 10 79  7]
 [11  6 53 43 79 23]
 [58 72 27 94 32 20]
 [ 6  6 48 48 49  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given the table of valuations, we can try to allocate the items to maximize the total satisfaction:

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 90.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 79.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 94.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 49, but item 4 is already allocated, so we move to the next highest valuation, which is item 2 at 48, but item 2 is also already allocated. Therefore, we choose the next highest, which is item 3 at 48, but item 3 is also allocated, so we select the next highest, which is item 4 at 49, but it's also allocated, so we select item 0 at 6.

However, this doesn't give each agent an item, and there are more items to allocate. We can adjust to ensure all items are allocated:

Hereâ€™s an adjusted allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 83).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 79).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 94).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value 48).
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 7).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 72).

This allocation tries to ensure a fair distribution based on the highest values for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
