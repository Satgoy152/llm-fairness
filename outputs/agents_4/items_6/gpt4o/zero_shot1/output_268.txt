Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  70  83  40  92  52
1  80  47  37  55   2  33
2  99  15  67  72  98  68
3  87  32   2  95  87  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[47 70 83 40 92 52]
 [80 47 37 55  2 33]
 [99 15 67 72 98 68]
 [87 32  2 95 87 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to assign items such that the total value is balanced among the agents. A common approach is to use an optimization method such as maximizing the minimum value or using a fair division strategy.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 47     | 70     | 83     | 40     | 92     | 52     |
| 1     | 80     | 47     | 37     | 55     | 2      | 33     |
| 2     | 99     | 15     | 67     | 72     | 98     | 68     |
| 3     | 87     | 32     | 2      | 95     | 87     | 89     |

Considering the goal to allocate all 6 items fairly, one strategy is to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0:
   - Assign item 4 (value 92)

2. Agent 1:
   - Assign item 0 (value 80)

3. Agent 2:
   - Assign item 2 (value 67)
   - Assign item 5 (value 68)

4. Agent 3:
   - Assign item 3 (value 95)
   - Assign item 1 (value 32)

This way, all items are allocated while trying to balance the total valuation across agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```
