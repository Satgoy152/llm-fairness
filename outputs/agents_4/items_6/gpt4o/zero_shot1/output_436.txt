Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  50  47  51  71  82
1  88  24  92  12  26  89
2  10  99  48  86   4  76
3  50  98  14  25  58  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that considers the valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to maximize the satisfaction of each agent, given that each agent should receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

Let's follow these steps to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High Valuation Matches**: Start by assigning items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that no agent receives more than one item initially, to maintain fairness.

2. **Balance the Allocation**: Since there are 4 agents and 6 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We should ensure that the distribution is as balanced as possible.

3. **Iterate and Adjust**: After the initial allocation, adjust the remaining items to ensure that the overall distribution maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 0 highly (84), and no other agent values item 0 higher than this.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest (92), so let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest (99), so let's allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 5 highly (86), which is the highest valuation for this item.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, and 5. The remaining items are 3 and 4.

- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (86) among those who haven't been allocated yet.
- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (71) among those who haven't been allocated yet.

With this approach, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their individual valuations.
