Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  11  36  57   8  48
1  54   6  22  69  80  42
2  72  96  81  87  28  98
3  44   4  62  69  59  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the total value of items each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign the highest value item first:** We start by assigning the items with the highest value to the respective agents who value them the most.

2. **Consider balance:** We try to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value, given their preferences.

3. **Iterate for best fit:** We iterate through the items and choose the best fit for each, given the constraints.

Let's go through the items:

- **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (72).
- **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (96).
- **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (81).
- **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (69).
- **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (80).
- **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (98).

Given these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 does not have the highest valuation for any item, they will not receive any items.
- **Agent 1**: Receives items 3 and 4.
- **Agent 2**: Receives items 0, 1, 2, and 5.
- **Agent 3**: Since Agent 3 does not have the highest valuation for any item, they will not receive any items.

Here's how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "3": []
}
``` 

This allocation maximizes the total value received by each agent based on their preferences and ensures each item is allocated.
