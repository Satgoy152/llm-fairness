Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  51  58  44  65  87
1  74   4  83  33  35  73
2  74  35   5  18  84  26
3  73  39  23  98  73  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 51 58 44 65 87]
 [74  4 83 33 35 73]
 [74 35  5 18 84 26]
 [73 39 23 98 73 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize total satisfaction. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 5 (87).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 2 (83).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 4 (84).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 3 (98).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 1):

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 and 1 both value it at 74. Since Agent 0 already has item 5, let's give item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 51, which is the highest among remaining unallocated items for Agent 0. Let's give item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, all items are allocated. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

Each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation considers each agent's highest valuations as much as possible.
