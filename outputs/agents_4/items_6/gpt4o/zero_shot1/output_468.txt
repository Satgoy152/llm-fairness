Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  25  81  24   7  28
1  24  61  81   6  19  17
2  91  95  94  17  29   6
3   3  71   7  33  35  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (81), Item 0 (38)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (81), Item 1 (61)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (95), Item 2 (94), Item 0 (91)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (95), Item 1 (71)

Considering the above preferences and trying to distribute the items fairly, one possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0:** Item 2 (81)
- **Agent 1:** Item 1 (61)
- **Agent 2:** Item 0 (91)
- **Agent 3:** Item 5 (95)

After assigning the highest valued items, let's allocate the remaining items 3 and 4:

- **Agent 1:** Item 3 (6)
- **Agent 3:** Item 4 (35)

Now each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall satisfaction based on the valuation is maximized.
