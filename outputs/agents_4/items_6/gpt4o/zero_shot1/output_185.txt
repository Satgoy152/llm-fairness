Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  40   7  16  23  35
1  11  33   0  23  19  99
2  56  65   2  35  70  65
3  91  12  71  37  49  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[30 40  7 16 23 35]
 [11 33  0 23 19 99]
 [56 65  2 35 70 65]
 [91 12 71 37 49 44]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 (40) and item 5 (35). Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 (99), but since item 5 is already assigned to Agent 0, we can assign item 3 (23) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (70). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 0 (91). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2 is left. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2 (71), so assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Each agent now has at least one item, and all items have been allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
