Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  92  24  68  40   3
1  17  86  80  16  83  30
2  98  83  56  43  47  34
3  31   6  82  19  33  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 83 56 43 47 34]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0 and moderate valuations for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 2.

We should try to allocate items in such a way that agents get the items they value the most, while ensuring fairness.

After analyzing the valuations, we can make the following allocation:

1. Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0, as they have high valuations for these items.
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they have a high valuation for it.
3. Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 2, as they have moderate valuations compared to others.
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3, as they have no particularly strong preferences, and this balances the distribution of items. 

Each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
