Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  49   1  41  16   1
1  74  40  99  49   9  39
2  45  89  61  38  45  27
3  71   8   9  36   9   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 49  1 41 16  1]
 [74 40 99 49  9 39]
 [45 89 61 38 45 27]
 [71  8  9 36  9  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Additionally, the total number of items allocated must equal 6. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's allocate items that Agent 0 values highly.
   - Item 1: 49 (highest valuation for Agent 0)
   - Item 3: 41 (second highest valuation for Agent 0)

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Item 2: 99 (highest valuation for Agent 1)

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly.
   - Item 1: 89 (highest valuation for Agent 2)
   - Item 4: 45 (tied highest remaining valuation for Agent 2)

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that Agent 3 values highly.
   - Item 0: 71 (highest valuation for Agent 3)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

Note: This allocation aims to balance the interests of each agent while distributing all items. Other allocation strategies could also be considered based on different fairness criteria.
