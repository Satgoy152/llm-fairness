Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  86  24  38  21   5
1  83  46  55  33  72  81
2  35  87   0  94  59   5
3  97  94  42  72  95  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's go through the process:

1. **Identify Total Items and Agents**: We have 6 items and 4 agents.
2. **Objective**: Fairly allocate 6 items among 4 agents.
3. **Approach**: Let's aim to maximize the total valuation by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (97).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (87).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (55).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (94).
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (95).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (81).

Now, let's distribute these items fairly:

- **Agent 0**: Unfortunately, Agent 0 doesn't have any item with the highest valuation.
- **Agent 1**: Gets Items 2 and 5.
- **Agent 2**: Gets Items 1 and 3.
- **Agent 3**: Gets Items 0 and 4.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
