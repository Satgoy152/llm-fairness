Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  82   2  56  80  75
1  61   9  58  22  21   3
2  40  65   0  55  72  22
3  84  23  65  18  98  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[33 82  2 56 80 75]
 [61  9 58 22 21  3]
 [40 65  0 55 72 22]
 [84 23 65 18 98 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method like maximizing the total valuation by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. Let's evaluate and assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and only six items are allocated in total.

First, let's look at the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most with 84.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most with 82.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most with 65.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with 56.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most with 98.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with 75.

Now, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, while keeping the total number of items allocated to six. Let's make adjustments:

1. Agent 0: Items 1, 3 (highest valuing for item 1 and item 3)
2. Agent 1: Item 2 (next highest after agent 3 for item 2)
3. Agent 2: Item 5 (highest valuation after agent 0 for item 5)
4. Agent 3: Items 0, 4 (highest valuing for items 0 and 4)

Thus, each agent gets at least one item, and six items in total are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
