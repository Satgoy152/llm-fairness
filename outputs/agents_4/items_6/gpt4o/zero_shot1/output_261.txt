Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  55  56  37  27  65
1  26  86   0   3  49  58
2  45  24   1  38  77  57
3  19  57   2  40  26  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple method that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. One possible approach is to assign items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest valuations:** We look for the highest valuation each agent has for the items.
2. **Allocate items:** We assign items starting from the ones with the highest valuations, ensuring that each item is only assigned to one agent.

Let's go through the allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 0 (70) and 5 (65). 
- **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 1 (86) and 5 (58), but item 5 is already taken by Agent 0.
- **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for item 4 (77).
- **Agent 3:** Highest valuations are for item 5 (92), but item 5 is already taken by Agent 0, so item 1 (57) is the next highest available.

Let's fairly allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
