Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  71  84  85  81  65
1  74  81  78  53  66  82
2  27  55   4  60  14  47
3  15  37  75  81  33  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on the valuations provided, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items while maximizing their total value. Since there are 4 agents and 6 items, not all agents will receive the same number of items. Let's aim to maximize the total value for each agent.

Here's a suggested allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on items with high values. Item 2 (value 84) and Item 3 (value 85) are highly valued by Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Items 0 (value 74) and 5 (value 82) have high values for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 3 (value 60) is the most highly valued item available after allocating to Agent 0 and 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value 37) is the highest remaining value for Agent 3.

Allocating items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction, here is a suggested allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 1

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it most highly among those with remaining allocations.

The JSON format for this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1]
}
```
