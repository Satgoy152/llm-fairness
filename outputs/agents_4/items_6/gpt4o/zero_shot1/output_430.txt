Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  80  39   8  30  39
1  76  25  18  19  42  34
2  22  50  11  39  92  33
3  91  12  99  87  26  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations for each agent and try to allocate items to maximize the value for each agent:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - 0 (70), 1 (80), 2 (39), 3 (8), 4 (30), 5 (39).
- Agent 1 values items: 
  - 0 (76), 1 (25), 2 (18), 3 (19), 4 (42), 5 (34).
- Agent 2 values items: 
  - 0 (22), 1 (50), 2 (11), 3 (39), 4 (92), 5 (33).
- Agent 3 values items: 
  - 0 (91), 1 (12), 2 (99), 3 (87), 4 (26), 5 (44).

To maximize fairness, we can consider the highest value items for each agent and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 1 (80)
   - Item 0 (70)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 4 (42)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 3 (39)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 2 (99)
   - Item 5 (44)

This allocation ensures that no agent is left without items, and the items are distributed in a way that considers the valuation each agent has for the items. Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation keeps all six items assigned and aims to fairly distribute them based on the valuations.
