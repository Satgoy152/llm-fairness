Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  45  65  13   2  24
1  17   8  49  81  43  29
2  45  35  22  68  89  62
3   4  78  97  58  93  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 35 22 68 89 62]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will also ensure that all 6 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations to determine a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [39, 45, 65, 13, 2, 24]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [17, 8, 49, 81, 43, 29]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [45, 35, 22, 68, 89, 62]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [4, 78, 97, 58, 93, 89]

Based on the highest values each agent assigns to items, we will allocate items accordingly:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 2 (65).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 3 (81).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 4 (89).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (78).

Now we look at the remaining items:

- Items 0 and 5 are left unallocated:
  - Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 45, which is the highest.
  - Item 5: Agent 3 values it at 89, which is the highest.

We can assign these remaining items based on the next highest preferences:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 3.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 3: Items 1 and 5

This ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is six.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
