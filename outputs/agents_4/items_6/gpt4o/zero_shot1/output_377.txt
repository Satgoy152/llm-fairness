Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  65  61  87  54  88
1  76  51  56  70  39  91
2  99  28  42  83  21  96
3  72  20   4   3  30  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 65 61 87 54 88]

 [99 28 42 83 21 96]
 [72 20  4  3 30 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate all 6 items among the 4 agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's look at the highest values each agent has for the items and try to allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 0 (91) and 5 (88).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 5 (91).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 0 (99).
4. **Agent 3**: Values are quite low, but the highest is for item 0 (72).

To balance the allocation fairly, let's assign the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (65), Item 3 (87)
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 (91)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (99), Item 4 (21)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (4)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and distributes all 6 items.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
