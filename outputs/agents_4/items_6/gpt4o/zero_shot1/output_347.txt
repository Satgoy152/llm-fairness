Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12   2  86  85  15  16
1  35   7  51   4  59  46
2  48  10  69  13  97  89
3  48  13  22  87   9  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [48 10 69 13 97 89]

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents based on their valuations, we can aim to assign items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while also attempting to balance the total number of items each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 (86) and item 3 (85) the highest, so we can assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 (59) the highest, so we assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 (97) and item 5 (89) highly, but item 4 is already taken. We assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 (87) highly, but it's taken. The next highest is item 0 (48), which is not assigned yet, so we give item 0 to Agent 3.
5. We still need to assign item 1. Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for it (10), so we assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, based on their preferences, while respecting the constraint of only allocating 6 items in total.
