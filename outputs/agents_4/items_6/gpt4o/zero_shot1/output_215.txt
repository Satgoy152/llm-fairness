Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  73  12  99  58  80
1  80  11  80  80  30  54
2  47  58  94  48  78  85
3  23  61  84  86  18  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item or has as fair an allocation as possible. Since there are 6 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 3 the highest (99). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 and item 2 equally (80). We can assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 the highest (94). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5 the highest (98). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, we have assigned 4 items and need to allocate the remaining 2 items (items 1 and 4).

5. **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it has the next highest valuation (73) after item 3.
6. **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it has a relatively high valuation (78) for item 4.

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and attempts to make the distribution fair based on individual valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
