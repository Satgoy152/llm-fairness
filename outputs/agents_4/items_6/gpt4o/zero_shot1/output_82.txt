Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  69  22  71  31  54
1  65  40   3  56  82  73
2  47  25  70  29  81   1
3  73  93  63  80  88  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 69 22 71 31 54]
 [65 40  3 56 82 73]
 [47 25 70 29 81  1]
 [73 93 63 80 88 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value of the allocations, often referred to as a weighted assignment problem or maximizing social welfare. Given the table of valuations, we need to assign each of the 6 items to one of the 4 agents in a way that maximizes the sum of their valuations for the items they receive.

One way to approach this is using the Hungarian algorithm, which is suitable for solving assignment problems. However, for simplicity, let's evaluate potential allocations manually to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuation is relatively high.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: receives item 3 (value: 71)
2. Agent 1: receives item 4 (value: 82)
3. Agent 2: receives item 2 (value: 70)
4. Agent 3: receives items 0, 1, and 5 (values: 73, 93, 70)

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the total number of allocated items is 6.
