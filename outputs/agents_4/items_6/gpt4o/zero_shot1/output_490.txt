Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  45   9  32  55  33
1  50  91  42  30  97  77
2  57  22  70  90  38  25
3   8  36  73  23  57  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 45  9 32 55 33]
 [50 91 42 30 97 77]
 [57 22 70 90 38 25]
 [ 8 36 73 23 57 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. This involves assigning items such that each agent perceives the allocation as fair according to their values.

Let's first observe the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (58).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (97).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (90).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (73).

To ensure fairness and maximize total utility, we can use a strategy to assign items based on the highest value for each agent, while ensuring each item is only allocated once.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as they value it the most.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as they value it the most.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as they value it the most.
4. Assign item 2 to agent 3, as they value it the most.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as their next highest valued item.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as their next highest valued item.

Now, let's represent this in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items in a way that maximizes their perceived value, while ensuring all items are allocated.
