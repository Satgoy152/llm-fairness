Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  22  59  35  34  13
1  24  57  58  66  41  45
2  49  74  71  42   4  52
3  44   2  49   3  26  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent receives approximately equal value from their allocated items, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**  
   Calculate the total value each agent would receive if they got all items, then aim to distribute items so each agent gets a fair share of their total valuation.

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Fairness:**  
   Assign items to agents in a way that attempts to give each agent a fair portion of the total value based on their individual valuations.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values items highest at positions [2, 3, 4], with values 59, 35, and 34 respectively.
- Agent 1 values items highest at positions [3, 1, 2], with values 66, 57, 58 respectively.
- Agent 2 values items highest at positions [1, 2, 0], with values 74, 71, 49 respectively.
- Agent 3 values items highest at positions [5, 0, 2], with values 58, 44, 49 respectively.

Allocating items to ensure balance:

- Agent 0: Assign item 2 (59 points) because it's their highest value.
- Agent 1: Assign item 3 (66 points) because it's their highest value and not taken.
- Agent 2: Assign item 1 (74 points) because itâ€™s their highest value and not taken.
- Agent 3: Assign item 5 (58 points) because it's their highest value and not taken.
- Now allocate remaining items:
  - Item 0: Assign to Agent 2 (49 points) for the next highest value.
  - Item 4: Assign to Agent 1 (41 points), as it balances the allocation.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their highest values while all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [5]
}
```
