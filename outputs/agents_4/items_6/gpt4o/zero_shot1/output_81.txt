Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  23  86  45  57   4
1  51  95   1  15  61  27
2  28  44   1  36  77  42
3  26  79  89  24  69   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (value 86). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (value 95). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (value 77). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 the highest, but it's already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is item 1, but itâ€™s also allocated. The next highest valuation is item 0 (value 26). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

5. Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, and 4. Items 3 and 5 are left for allocation.

6. For item 3:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 45.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 15.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 at 36.
   - Agent 3 values item 3 at 24.
   
   Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3, so assign item 3 to Agent 0.

7. For item 5:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 at 4.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 at 27.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 at 42.
   - Agent 3 values item 5 at 9.

   Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5, so assign item 5 to Agent 2.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
