Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  92   9  62  53  14
1  46  31  90  34  77   9
2  21  11  47  71  77  76
3  85  14  34  42  34  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are assigned. We will try to balance the value distribution so that no agent is significantly disadvantaged. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (92), so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (90), so we allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (76), so we allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (85), so we allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. Next, we allocate item 4 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it (77) as high as agent 1 and agent 0, but agent 2 currently has fewer items.
6. Finally, we allocate item 3 to agent 0, which provides a relatively high value (62) and balances their item count.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the overall distribution of value is relatively balanced. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
