Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  11   2  63  23  61
1  49  60  46  65  52  45
2  97  47  76  50  16  90
3   7   6  42  16  57  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 11  2 63 23 61]
 [49 60 46 65 52 45]
 [97 47 76 50 16 90]
 [ 7  6 42 16 57 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that ensures each agent receives the items they value the most while also distributing the total number of items evenly. Each agent should ideally receive 1 or 2 items since there are 4 agents and 6 items in total. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Agent 0's preferences**: [67, 11, 2, 63, 23, 61]
2. **Agent 1's preferences**: [49, 60, 46, 65, 52, 45]
3. **Agent 2's preferences**: [97, 47, 76, 50, 16, 90]
4. **Agent 3's preferences**: [7, 6, 42, 16, 57, 22]

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 2 (97)
- **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 1 (60)
- **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 2 (76)
- **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 1 (65)
- **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 3 (57)
- **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 2 (90)

Now we have:

- Agent 0: 0 items
- Agent 1: 2 items
- Agent 2: 3 items
- Agent 3: 1 item

To balance it better:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since Agent 2 already has many items.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 to balance the number of items.

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (remove from Agent 1)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 2
- **Agent 3**: Item 4, Item 5

Revised allocation considering the balancing:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 0, Item 2
- **Agent 3**: Item 4, Item 5

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This ensures each agent gets a fair share of items based on their preferences and the constraints of the problem.
