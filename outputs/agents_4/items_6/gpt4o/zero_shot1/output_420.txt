Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  24  58  69  51  98
1  99  21  57  92  82  75
2  12  91  23  91  25  91
3  50  62  66  34  27  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and no item is allocated more than once. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify each agent's highest-valued items**: For each agent, identify the items that have the highest value to them.

2. **Allocate items based on unique high values**: If an item is the highest value for only one agent, allocate it directly to that agent.

3. **Resolve conflicts**: If multiple agents have the highest value for the same item, choose the allocation that maximizes the total value across all agents.

4. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Since there are 6 items and 4 agents, some agents may receive more than one item or no items at all.

Let's apply this approach to the given table:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 0 (72) and 5 (98).
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 0 (99) and 3 (92).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 1 (91), 3 (91), and 5 (91).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 2 (66) and 1 (62).

**Allocating high-value items**:
- Item 0: Highest value for Agent 1 (99).
- Item 1: Highest value for Agent 2 (91).
- Item 2: Highest value for Agent 3 (66).
- Item 3: Conflicts between Agents 1 and 2, but Agent 1 has another high-value item (0), so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 4: This item has the lowest values across the board, so allocate to an agent with fewer items.
- Item 5: Highest value for Agent 0 (98).

**Proposed Allocation**:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1, 3]
- Agent 3: [2, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent's highest priorities are considered and all items are fairly distributed. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
