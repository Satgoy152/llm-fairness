Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  70  27  89  32  43
1  96  27  75  72  61  10
2  41  93  71  26  58  13
3  37   7  69  38  11  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets approximately equal value in terms of their own valuations, while also respecting that each agent can receive an integer number of items. We also need to ensure all items are allocated. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's total value for the items they receive.

Let's go through the allocation process:

**Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
- Agent 0: \( 74 + 70 + 27 + 89 + 32 + 43 = 335 \)
- Agent 1: \( 96 + 27 + 75 + 72 + 61 + 10 = 341 \)
- Agent 2: \( 41 + 93 + 71 + 26 + 58 + 13 = 302 \)
- Agent 3: \( 37 + 7 + 69 + 38 + 11 + 90 = 252 \)

**Greedy Item Allocation Approach:**
1. Assign items to agents based on who values the item most.
2. Adjust if needed to ensure each agent gets a fair share and all items are allocated.

**Allocation:**
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (96).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (93).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (75).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (89).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (32).
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most (90).

After this initial allocation, we have:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 5

This allocation gives each agent a reasonably fair share based on their valuations. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5]
}
```
