Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  35  89   4  32  71
1  86  16  19  63  58  30
2  42  68  20  72  88   7
3  84  31  58   0   5  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences. Each agent should ideally get at least one item, and the distribution should be as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 2 the most (89). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** The highest value for Agent 1 is for item 0 (86). Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 4 the most (88). Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** The highest value for Agent 3 is for item 0, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 2, but itâ€™s also taken. The next is item 3 (58), but it's already taken in the previous allocations. The next highest available item is item 5, valued at 44. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, let's consider the remaining items:
- Items 1 and 3 are left to be allocated.

5. **Agent 0:** The next highest available value after item 2 is item 1 (35). Since item 1 is still available, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 2:** The next highest available value after item 4 is item 3 (72). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

The allocation is complete, and each item has been assigned to an agent. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to be fair by ensuring each agent receives items they value significantly, while also distributing the available items fairly among the agents.
