Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  97   7  72  14  16
1  45  16  77  61  51  98
2  41  42  63  28  94  83
3  25  52  28  71  99  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One way to do this is to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes the total value of items each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Highest value for item 1 (97)
- Agent 1: Highest value for item 5 (98)
- Agent 2: Highest value for item 4 (94)
- Agent 3: Highest value for item 4 (99), but agent 2 already has item 4. Next highest is item 3 (71)

After assigning these items based on the highest values, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 3

Now we have to allocate the remaining items 0, 2, and ensure all agents have at least one item:

- Agent 0 has a reasonable value for item 0 (56), and no agent currently has item 0.
- Agent 1 has a reasonable value for item 2 (77), and no agent currently has item 2.

This gives us:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 0
- Agent 1: Items 5, 2
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 3

All items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
