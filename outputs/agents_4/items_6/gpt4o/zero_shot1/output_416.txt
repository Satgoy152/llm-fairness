Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  87   6  65  68  65
1  92  16  44  34  38  33
2  21  86  77   8  72  37
3  53  76  36  32  71  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives a balanced value of items according to their valuations. One way to achieve this is by using a round-robin allocation method based on the highest value an agent assigns to an item that hasn't been allocated yet.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is item 1 with a value of 87.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is item 0 with a value of 92.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is item 1 with a value of 86 (already taken), so the next highest is item 2 with a value of 77.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is item 5 with a value of 85.

Now, all agents have been considered once, and we repeat the process for the remaining items.

5. **Agent 0**: Next highest value is item 0 with a value of 81 (already taken), so item 3 with a value of 65.
6. **Agent 1**: Next highest value is item 4 with a value of 38.

All items have now been allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing each agent's assigned value.
