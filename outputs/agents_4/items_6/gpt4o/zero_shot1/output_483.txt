Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  88  59  69  53  13
1   1  84   1  22  25  74
2  44  19  29  53  97  66
3  20  71   2  78   5  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 19 29 53 97 66]
 [20 71  2 78  5 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent. A common strategy is to use a greedy algorithm where agents pick their highest-valued item available. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by creating a list of all items and their values for each agent.
2. Allow each agent to choose the item that gives them the highest value, ensuring no item is chosen more than once.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 1 (88).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 5 (74).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 4 (97).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3 (78).
- Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 2.
- Agent 0 could then take item 0 (37).
- Agent 2 could take item 2 (29).

This ensures each item is allocated to one agent, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
