Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  23  91  50  37  62
1  29  78  41  38  78  84
2  70  68  67  81  77  49
3   8  56  59  22  89  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonably equitable share based on their valuations. This means considering the value each agent places on each item and attempting to maximize total satisfaction.

To achieve this, we can use a strategy that involves assigning items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and that all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (91).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items 1 (78) and 5 (84).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (81).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4 (89).

Considering these high valuations, we can start by allocating these items to the respective agents:

- Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Assign items 1 and 5 to agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to agent 3.

Now we have allocated 5 items, and item 0 is still available. We should allocate this item to an agent who hasn't reached their maximum potential value or has the least number of items. Agent 0 has only one item, and assigning item 0 to them gives them a second item, balancing the distribution:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.

Now all items are allocated, and the distribution is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, while distributing all items among the agents.
