Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  62   0  23  18  57
1  12  98  43  26  75  56
2  99  15  44  46  95  28
3   1  49  15  13  70  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One simple approach is to utilize a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 58.
   - Agent 1 values it at 12.
   - Agent 2 values it at 99.
   - Agent 3 values it at 1.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 99).

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 62.
   - Agent 1 values it at 98.
   - Agent 2 values it at 15.
   - Agent 3 values it at 49.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 98).

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 0.
   - Agent 1 values it at 43.
   - Agent 2 values it at 44.
   - Agent 3 values it at 15.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 44).

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 23.
   - Agent 1 values it at 26.
   - Agent 2 values it at 46.
   - Agent 3 values it at 13.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 46).

5. **Item 4**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 18.
   - Agent 1 values it at 75.
   - Agent 2 values it at 95.
   - Agent 3 values it at 70.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 95).

6. **Item 5**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 57.
   - Agent 1 values it at 56.
   - Agent 2 values it at 28.
   - Agent 3 values it at 78.
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (highest value: 78).

Agent allocations based on the above evaluation:

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 5.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
