Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  22  26  10  54   2
1  35  39  75  58  52   0
2   2  38   2  54  69  44
3  55   5   8  23  13  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[54 22 26 10 54  2]
 [35 39 75 58 52  0]
 [ 2 38  2 54 69 44]
 [55  5  8 23 13 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives. A good approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations table:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5
    0  54  22  26  10  54   2
    1  35  39  75  58  52   0
    2   2  38   2  54  69  44
    3  55   5   8  23  13  49
```

Now, let's allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (55).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (38), but Agent 1 is also a strong candidate (39). To ensure each agent has a chance, we will assign it to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (75).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (54).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (69).
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most (49).

Now let's review the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items is 6:

- Agent 0: Currently has no item, but they value item 0 as 54, which is close to Agent 3’s valuation. We can give item 0 to Agent 0 to ensure they receive an item.
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3: Item 5.

Let's check this allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [3, 4]
- Agent 3: [5]

This allocation respects the condition that each agent receives items and all 6 items are allocated.

Here’s the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
