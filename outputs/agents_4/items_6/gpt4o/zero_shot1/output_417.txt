Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  98  29  20  55  42
1   9  16   5  56  20  19
2  83  16  37  31  30   7
3  14  21  26  27   1  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total utility or value derived by all agents. This involves examining the valuations each agent has for the items and assigning the items such that the total worth obtained by all agents is optimized. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 0. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0, but since item 0 is already allocated, we assign item 2 to Agent 2, which is their next highest.
4. Agent 3 has highest valuations for item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. For the remaining item 4, assign it to Agent 2 as it maximizes their total value.

This allocation strategy attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives based on the given table. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents fairly, with each agent receiving items that they value highly.
