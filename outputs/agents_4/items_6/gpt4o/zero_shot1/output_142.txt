Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  20  15  91  88  63
1  62  60  55  15   7  38
2  15  25  73  46   1  10
3   3   3  70  72  34   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. A common approach is to maximize the total value across all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [5, 20, 15, 91, 88, 63]
- Agent 1: [62, 60, 55, 15, 7, 38]
- Agent 2: [15, 25, 73, 46, 1, 10]
- Agent 3: [3, 3, 70, 72, 34, 3]

To distribute the items fairly, we'll assign items based on the highest value each agent assigns to an unallocated item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 91.
2. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 62.
3. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 73.
4. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 34.
5. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the second highest at 60.
6. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 5 the second highest at 63.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations and distributes all items.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
