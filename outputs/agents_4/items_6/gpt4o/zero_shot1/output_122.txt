Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  58  17  12  45  38
1  21  18  37  16  60  47
2  49  24  11  69  52  21
3  33  28  14  89  22  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 24 11 69 52 21]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation should consider the preferences of each agent as expressed by their valuations. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high value for item 1.
2. **Agent 1** has high value for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has high value for item 3.
4. **Agent 3** has high value for item 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 2.

- Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2.
- Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 1.

Based on this evaluation, a possible fair allocation of items can be:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 3: Item 5

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5]
}
```
