Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  59  58  57  56  82
1  72   7   3  44  92  49
2   7  43  43  40  76  93
3  96  38   8  14  82  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. This approach balances fairness with maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: Look for items that have high valuations for particular agents and allocate those first.
2. **Balance Remaining Allocation**: Distribute remaining items to ensure each agent gets at least one item.

After analyzing the table, here's a suitable allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 5 (Value: 82)
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (Value: 92)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (Value: 43)
- **Agent 3**: Item 0 (Value: 96)

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Add Item 1 (Value: 59)
- **Agent 1**: Add Item 3 (Value: 44)

Each agent has received at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0]
}
``` 

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
