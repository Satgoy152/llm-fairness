Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  32   1  51   6  11
1  30  88   4  10  47  67
2  21  13  45  67  72  62
3  39  92  12  89  63   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has for any item, and try to allocate those items to the respective agents.
2. Ensure no item is allocated more than once and all items are allocated.
3. Adjust as necessary to ensure all agents get at least one item if possible or distribute fairly based on their preferences.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (51).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (88).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (72).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 as well, but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 3 (89), which is also taken, so we give them item 0 (39).

Now, let's distribute the remaining items (0, 2, 5) ensuring fairness:

- For item 0, since agent 0 and 3 have the next highest valuations, assign it to agent 3, as agent 0 already has an item.
- For item 2, agent 2 values it the highest (45).
- For item 5, agent 1 values it the highest (67).

Let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their valuation satisfaction.
