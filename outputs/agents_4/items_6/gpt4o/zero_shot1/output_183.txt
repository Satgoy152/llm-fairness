Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  10  84  55  83  40  84
1  10   2  43  22  28  97
2  60  25   2  78  69  91
3  25  62  69  18  56  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences. Let's take a straightforward approach and attempt to allocate items to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the items:

1. **Item 0:**  
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 60.
   
2. **Item 1:**  
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
   - Agent 3 values it at 62, which is the second highest.
   
3. **Item 2:**  
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 69.
   - Agent 0 values it at 55, which is the second highest.
   
4. **Item 3:**  
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 83.
   - Agent 2 values it at 78, which is the second highest.

5. **Item 4:**  
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 69.
   - Agent 0 values it at 40, which is the second highest.

6. **Item 5:**  
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 97.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Items 1, 3
- **Agent 1:** Item 5
- **Agent 2:** Items 0, 4
- **Agent 3:** Item 2

This ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their highest valuations.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
