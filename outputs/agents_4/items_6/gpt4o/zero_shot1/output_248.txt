Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  53  29  24  92  19
1  89  52  13  20  87  71
2  46  88  78   2   6  18
3  86  98  53  44  20  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 88 78  2  6 18]
 [86 98 53 44 20 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table to determine a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value for item 4 (92).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value for item 0 (89).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value for item 1 (88).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value for item 1 (98), but since Agent 2 has already been assigned item 1, we should look for the next highest value item.

Let's proceed with allocating the items based on maximizing the values for each agent:

- **Item 4** to Agent 0 (value = 92)
- **Item 0** to Agent 1 (value = 89)
- **Item 1** to Agent 2 (value = 88)
- **Item 3** to Agent 3 (value = 44)
- **Item 5** to Agent 3 (value = 83)
- **Item 2** to Agent 0 (value = 29)

With this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and we've maximized the total value across the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
