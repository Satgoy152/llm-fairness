Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  55  75  38  81  56
1  37  54  99  79  90  76
2  98  32  79  45  43  49
3  59  57  23  41  70  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37 54 99 79 90 76]
 [98 32 79 45 43 49]
 [59 57 23 41 70 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given table:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0 (93) and 4 (81).
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 2 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 0 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Does not have particularly high valuations, but item 3 (41) is relatively higher compared to their other valuations.

Considering these observations, we can allocate items to maximize the total valuation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocated item 4 (81) because that's the highest among unallocated items.
- **Agent 1**: Allocated item 2 (99) as it is their highest valuation.
- **Agent 2**: Allocated item 0 (98) as it is their highest valuation.
- **Agent 3**: Allocated item 3 (41) as it is their highest available valuation.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We still need to allocate items 1 and 5.

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (55) as it is their highest unallocated valuation.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5 (76) since it's the highest available remaining value for them.

Now, all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
