Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  12  93  59  36  37
1  47  39   6  18  88  23
2  27  70  67  40   3  52
3  83  79  81  68  52  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Given that there are 4 agents and 6 items, some agents will receive more items than others. However, we aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (total valuation) is maximized.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 1.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 3 and 5.

Based on these preferences, one possible allocation is:

- Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that they value highly, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
