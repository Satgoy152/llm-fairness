Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  19  99  30  87  24
1  73  71  69  62  26  55
2  31  38  31  40  23  37
3  34  47   3  67  38  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[34 19 99 30 87 24]
 [73 71 69 62 26 55]
 [31 38 31 40 23 37]
 [34 47  3 67 38 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 4. 
   - We allocate item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 has relatively high valuations across most items. 
   - We allocate items 0 and 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 has balanced but generally lower valuations.
   - We allocate items 3 and 5 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4.
   - We allocate item 4 to agent 3.

This allocation attempts to balance the individual preferences by giving each agent items that maximize their valuations as much as possible, given the constraint that each agent should receive at least one item.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
