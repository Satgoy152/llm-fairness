Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  10  40  29   8  70  53
1  58  24  22  45  31  98
2  25  29  74  52  38  17
3  45  80  78  76   7  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 29 74 52 38 17]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to consider the preferences of each agent by looking at their highest valuations and also ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Highest value for item 4 (70)
- Agent 1: Highest value for item 5 (98)
- Agent 2: Highest value for item 2 (74)
- Agent 3: Highest value for item 1 (80)

We will start by assigning each agent their most valued item and then distribute the remaining items:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 3

Now, we have assigned 4 items, and we need to allocate 2 more items:

- Remaining items are 0 and 3.

Considering the remaining highest preferences:
- Agent 0 has high value for item 1 (40), but it's already taken.
- Agent 1 has high value for item 0 (58).
- Agent 2 has high value for item 3 (52).
- Agent 3 has item 0 as the next high valuation (45).

Allocate remaining items:
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1)
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2)

Now, the items have been fairly allocated. The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
