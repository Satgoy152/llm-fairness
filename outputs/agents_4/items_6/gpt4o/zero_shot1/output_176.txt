Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  64  58  78   7  87
1  62  58   1  31  88  44
2  50  89  51  88  39   4
3  67  67  71  99  42  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 58  1 31 88 44]
 [50 89 51 88 39  4]
 [67 67 71 99 42 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by evaluating the highest valuation each agent has for the available items.
2. Assign items based on maximizing total satisfaction for each agent.

Here's the allocation process:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (87).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 (88).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (89).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 (99).
- Assign the remaining items based on maximizing the next highest valuations:
  - Agent 0 can be assigned item 2 (58) because it's their next highest valuation.
  - Agent 1 can be assigned item 0 (62) because it's their next highest valuation.

Based on this allocation process, the result is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation assigns all six items while maximizing the overall satisfaction for each agent.
