Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  94  13  20  44  20
1   5  46  57  98  59  96
2  67  68  94   8  31  60
3  22  40  81  41  61  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 94 13 20 44 20]
 [ 5 46 57 98 59 96]
 [67 68 94  8 31 60]
 [22 40 81 41 61 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent has for their allocated items while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze and allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (94)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (55)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (98)
   - Next highest: Item 5 (96)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (94)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (67) [Already allocated to Agent 0]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (98) [Already allocated to Agent 1]
   - Next highest: Item 2 (81) [Already allocated to Agent 2]
   - Next highest: Item 4 (61)

Based on the above analysis, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 5
- **Agent 2**: Item 2
- **Agent 3**: Item 4

Let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
