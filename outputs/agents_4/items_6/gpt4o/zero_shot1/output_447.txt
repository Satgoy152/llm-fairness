Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  83  58  30  55  74
1  73  90  97  96  57   8
2  76  52  14  20  56  73
3  10   7  20  84  20  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[22 83 58 30 55 74]
 [73 90 97 96 57  8]
 [76 52 14 20 56 73]
 [10  7 20 84 20 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent places on the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this scenario, we have 4 agents and 6 items, so not every agent will receive an item. Let's try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the overall valuation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [22, 83, 58, 30, 55, 74]
Agent 1: [73, 90, 97, 96, 57, 8]
Agent 2: [76, 52, 14, 20, 56, 73]
Agent 3: [10, 7, 20, 84, 20, 92]
```

Let's analyze and allocate items to maximize the total valuation:

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (97), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 1 also values item 1 highly (90), allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 1 values item 3 the next highest (96), allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (92), allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (22), allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
6. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (56), allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed among the agents based on their highest valuations, and each agent gets at least one item, maximizing the total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
