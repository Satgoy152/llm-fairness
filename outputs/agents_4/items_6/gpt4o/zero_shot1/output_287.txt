Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  68  56  56  61  33
1  40  65  18  86   5  46
2  99  83  69  83  14  13
3  23  37  31  87  95  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items most as follows: 0 (96), 1 (68), 2 (56), 3 (56), 4 (61), 5 (33)
- Agent 1 values items most as follows: 3 (86), 1 (65), 5 (46), 0 (40), 2 (18), 4 (5)
- Agent 2 values items most as follows: 0 (99), 1 (83), 3 (83), 2 (69), 4 (14), 5 (13)
- Agent 3 values items most as follows: 4 (95), 3 (87), 5 (68), 1 (37), 2 (31), 0 (23)

A potential fair allocation could be formed by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring no item is assigned more than once. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (99).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (86).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as they value it the highest (95).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it the second highest (68) after item 0, which is already allocated.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as they also value it highly (68), and Agent 3 has another item highly valued.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it (56) and it's one of their remaining higher valued items.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it highly and balances the distribution among agents:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This distribution considers each agent's preferences and ensures that all items are allocated fairly.
