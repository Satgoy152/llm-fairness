Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  66  39  56  84   9
1  57  55  28  37   0  90
2  43  27  80  51  76  19
3  50  45  48  24  70  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 55 28 37  0 90]
 [43 27 80 51 76 19]
 [50 45 48 24 70 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation each agent has for the items they receive. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 98.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 66.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 80.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 56.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 84.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 90.

After assigning based on the highest valuations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: No items allocated

Let's ensure fairness by redistributing items so that each agent receives at least one item. We can consider redistributing item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 3 (as Agent 3 has a reasonable valuation of 45 for it) and ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: Item [1]

This allocation gives each agent at least one item.

Here is the JSON representation of the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
