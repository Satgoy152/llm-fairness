Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  98  80  86  95  17
1   9  32  27  10  83  74
2  90  43  23  19   3  82
3   7  51  35  44  75   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 98 80 86 95 17]
 [ 9 32 27 10 83 74]
 [90 43 23 19  3 82]
 [ 7 51 35 44 75  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Here's one approach to achieving this:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (98), Item 4 (95)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (83), Item 5 (74)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (90), Item 5 (82)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (75), Item 3 (44)

To ensure each agent gets at least one item and the total allocation equals six items, we need to balance the allocations based on the highest valuations while ensuring a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 1 (98)
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 5 (74)
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 0 (90)
- **Agent 3**: Assign Item 3 (44)

Now we have allocated 4 items, two more to go. Let's allocate remaining items to maximize total satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 4 (95)
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 2 (23)

This way, each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing total valuations for each agent.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
