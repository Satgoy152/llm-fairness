Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  50  28  96   0  25
1   2  81  57  57  96  82
2  27  79  22   4   1  53
3   1   0  85  96  87  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a method based on maximizing the individual agent's satisfaction or total value.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that every agent receives at least one item. If an agent doesn't initially receive an item, find an item they value sufficiently and make a swap if necessary.

Let's evaluate each item's highest value:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 74 (highest)
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 81 (highest)
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it at 85 (highest)
- Item 3: Agents 0 and 3 both value it at 96, but let's prioritize based on other allocations.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 96 (highest)
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 82 (highest)

Initial allocation based on maximum value:

- Item 0 -> Agent 0
- Item 1 -> Agent 1
- Item 2 -> Agent 3
- Item 3 -> Agent 0 or 3 (Choose Agent 3 to balance)
- Item 4 -> Agent 1
- Item 5 -> Agent 1

Checking allocations:
- Agent 0: 1 item
- Agent 1: 3 items
- Agent 2: 0 items
- Agent 3: 2 items

To ensure that Agent 2 receives an item, we can swap one item:

- Swap Item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values it at 53, which is the next highest value after Agent 1.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item while attempting to maximize the value each agent receives.

Final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
