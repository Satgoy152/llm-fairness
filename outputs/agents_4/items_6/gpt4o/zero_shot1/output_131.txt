Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  42  34  86   3  59
1  53  67  80  99  46  10
2  32  46  13  23  73  48
3   0  87  75  52  24  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction or valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than the fair share unless necessary. Let's try to distribute the items:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 34
   - Agent 1 values it at 53
   - Agent 2 values it at 32
   - Agent 3 values it at 0
   - **Assign to Agent 1** because they value it the most.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 42
   - Agent 1 values it at 67
   - Agent 2 values it at 46
   - Agent 3 values it at 87
   - **Assign to Agent 3** because they value it the most.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 34
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 13
   - Agent 3 values it at 75
   - **Assign to Agent 1** because they value it the most.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 86
   - Agent 1 values it at 99
   - Agent 2 values it at 23
   - Agent 3 values it at 52
   - **Assign to Agent 1** because they value it the most.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 3
   - Agent 1 values it at 46
   - Agent 2 values it at 73
   - Agent 3 values it at 24
   - **Assign to Agent 2** because they value it the most.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59
   - Agent 1 values it at 10
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - Agent 3 values it at 33
   - **Assign to Agent 0** because they value it the most.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: [5]
- Agent 1 gets items: [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 2 gets items: [4]
- Agent 3 gets items: [1]

And here's the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring all items are distributed.
