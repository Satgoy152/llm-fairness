Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  72  47  42   3  71
1  90  55  93  37  11  22
2  28  23  77  90  39  45
3  13  48  46  34  89   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 72 47 42  3 71]
 [90 55 93 37 11 22]
 [28 23 77 90 39 45]
 [13 48 46 34 89  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every agent gets at least one item. Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest valuation for agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 72.
2. **Agent 1:** The highest valuation for agent 1 is item 2 with a value of 93.
3. **Agent 2:** The highest valuation for agent 2 is item 3 with a value of 90.
4. **Agent 3:** The highest valuation for agent 3 is item 4 with a value of 89.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items while considering the next highest valuations:

5. **Agent 0:** The second highest valuation is item 5 with a value of 71.
6. **Agent 1:** The second highest valuation is item 0 with a value of 90.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the allocations are fair based on their valuations. The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
