Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  88   6  20  40  95
1  77  65  47  68  47   5
2  72  40  71  86  14  99
3  49  41   4   7  77   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction or ensure equitable distribution based on these valuations. Given there are 4 agents and 6 items, not every agent will receive the same number of items, but we should aim for a fair distribution.

Here's one approach to allocate the items fairly:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent and try to allocate it to them first.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed, considering the remaining valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (95), so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (77), so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (99), but it's already taken, so go for the next highest, which is item 3 (86), and assign it to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (77), so assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 1 and 2.

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it second highest (88) after item 5.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it third highest (71) after items 5 and 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the highest valuations.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
