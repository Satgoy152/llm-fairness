Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  35  41  48  13  33
1  39  58  13  38  39   6
2  36   5  31  61  75  11
3  28   6   1  85  73  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 5 35 41 48 13 33]
 [39 58 13 38 39  6]
 [36  5 31 61 75 11]
 [28  6  1 85 73 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we aim to maximize total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider the highest valuations each agent has for unallocated items in each step. Here's one way to allocate:

1. **Agent 3** has a very high valuation for item 3 (85), which is the highest single valuation among all items. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (75) after item 3 is allocated. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 3** has the second-highest valuation for item 5 (92). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1 (58). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** has a reasonable valuation for item 2 (41). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
6. The remaining item is item 0. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0 (39). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

Now, each item has been allocated:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 3, 5

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
