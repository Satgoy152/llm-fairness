Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  22  94  31  25  93
1  44  32  82  28  52  64
2  87  41  22  83  24  42
3  10  73  83  15  35  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 41 22 83 24 42]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and only six items are distributed in total. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 (94) and 5 (93). Assign items 2 and 5 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has moderate valuations for items, but since Agent 0 took items with their highest valuations, we will assign item 4 (52) to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (87). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 (73) and item 3 (15). Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 3.

This allocation satisfies the condition of distributing exactly 6 items among the 4 agents. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
