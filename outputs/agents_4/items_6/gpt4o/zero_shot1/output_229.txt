Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  17  14  90  33  22
1  82  55   6   2  48  76
2  89  48  26  83  80   2
3  34  74  34   1  24  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 55  6  2 48 76]
 [89 48 26 83 80  2]
 [34 74 34  1 24 78]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would receive for each possible allocation.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item by considering the agent's highest valuation item.
3. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Receives item 3 (value 90)
- Agent 1: Receives items 0 and 5 (values 82 and 76)
- Agent 2: Receives items 2 and 4 (values 26 and 80)
- Agent 3: Receives item 1 (value 74)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total valuation is maximized across all agents.

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation provides a balanced distribution based on the given valuations.
