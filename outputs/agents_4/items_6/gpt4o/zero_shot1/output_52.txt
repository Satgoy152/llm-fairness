Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  85  10  49  76  62
1   2  44   4  87  16  89
2  82  88  50  38  59  56
3  21  29  45  60  93  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (88) and item 0 (82), so we allocate these items to Agent 2 first.
   
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (89) and item 3 (87), so we allocate these items to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (93), so we allocate this item to Agent 3.

4. **Agent 0** is left with item 2, which it values at 10.

After this allocation, the distribution of items is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 5 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 0.
- Agent 3 receives item 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
