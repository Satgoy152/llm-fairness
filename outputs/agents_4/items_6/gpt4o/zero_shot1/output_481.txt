Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  76  40  30  33  60
1  20  32  41  56  35  29
2  57  21  53  99  55  28
3  81  29  70  81  43  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the preferences of each agent for the items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the total valuation across all agents.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5. To maximize their total valuation, we will allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a relatively high valuation for item 3. We will allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 4. We will allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 2 and 3, but item 3 has already been allocated to Agent 1. We will allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

The allocation, based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction, is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and takes into account the agents' preferences as much as possible.
