Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  40  33  91  42   8
1  54  46  86  39  92  33
2  37  43  31   1  29  89
3  83  26  85  21  36   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items maximizing their total valuation while keeping the distribution balanced. A possible method is to attempt to allocate items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, with the total number of items being 6.

We'll approach this by examining the valuations and attempting to assign items to agents based on who values them the most, while keeping the distribution balanced.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 83.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 3.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 46.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 86.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 91.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 92.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 89.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items is 6.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, agent 0 receives item 3, agent 1 receives items 1, 2, and 4, agent 2 receives item 5, and agent 3 receives item 0. This distribution ensures each agent gets some items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.
