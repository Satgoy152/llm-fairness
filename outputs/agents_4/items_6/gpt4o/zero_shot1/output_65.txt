Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  51  47  98  71  62
1  47  65  97  64  33  20
2  93  49  68  19   7  63
3  82   6  27  32  77  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 65 97 64 33 20]
 [93 49 68 19  7 63]
 [82  6 27 32 77 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on who values each item the most, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's determine the allocation:

- For item 0, agent 2 values it the most (93).
- For item 1, agent 1 values it the most (65).
- For item 2, agent 1 values it the most (97).
- For item 3, agent 0 values it the most (98).
- For item 4, agent 3 values it the most (77).
- For item 5, agent 0 values it the most (62).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.
- Agent 3 receives item 4.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
