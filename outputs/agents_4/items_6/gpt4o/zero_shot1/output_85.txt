Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  87  68  76  25  74
1  67  70  18  78  50  26
2  71  92  60  27  18  89
3  43  94  23  47  29  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair portion based on their valuations. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and consider maximizing the individual satisfaction by comparing agent preferences for each item.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's analyze each agent's highest preferences:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 1 (87).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 3 (78).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 1 (92), but since item 1 has already been assigned, we look at the next highest which is item 5 (89).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 1 (94), but since item 1 has already been assigned, we look at the next highest which is item 3 (47), but since item 3 is also assigned, we look at item 0 (43).

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3]
- Agent 2: Items [5]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 4]

In JSON format, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated. Each agent receives items that have relatively high valuations according to their preferences.
