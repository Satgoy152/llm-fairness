Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  12  64  38  26  96
1  46  29  43  73  59  79
2  84  78  92  25  28  98
3  55  64  40  84  76  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 78 92 25 28 98]
 [55 64 40 84 76 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [85, 12, 64, 38, 26, 96]
- Agent 1: [46, 29, 43, 73, 59, 79]
- Agent 2: [84, 78, 92, 25, 28, 98]
- Agent 3: [55, 64, 40, 84, 76, 56]

We want to assign items to agents so that the total value is maximized. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 5 has the highest combined valuation for all agents, and Agent 2 values it the most at 98. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
2. Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 0 at 85 and Agent 2 at 84. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since it's their highest value.
3. Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 2 at 92. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 3 at 84. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 2 at 78 but is also valued by Agent 3 at 64. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 to maximize their total value.
6. Item 4 is valued at 76 by Agent 3, their next highest after item 3. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 5, 1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and maximizes the total valuation across all agents.
