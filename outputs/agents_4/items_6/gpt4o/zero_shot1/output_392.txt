Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  14  86  42  82  55
1  43   9  50  53   2  59
2  29  35  72  32  10  15
3   9  92  53  87  49  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the six items among the four agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items where they hold the highest value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 3** has a very high valuation for item 1, so they should receive item 1.
2. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly, so they should receive item 2.
3. **Agent 3** also has a high valuation for item 3, so they should receive item 3.
4. **Agent 0** values item 4 highly, so they should receive item 4.
5. **Agent 1** values item 5 the most, so they should receive item 5.
6. **Agent 2** can take item 0 since others have already received high-value items for them, and this balances the allocation.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent's satisfaction is maximized based on their valuations for the items they receive.
