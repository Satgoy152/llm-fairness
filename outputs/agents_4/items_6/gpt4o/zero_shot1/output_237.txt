Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  38  82   3  74  51
1  82  25  34  78  44  81
2  96  46  50  33  85  33
3  74  47  96   8  12  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44 38 82  3 74 51]
 [82 25 34 78 44 81]
 [96 46 50 33 85 33]
 [74 47 96  8 12 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 44.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 78.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 85.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most at 96.

After these assignments, we have items 1 and 5 left. Let's allocate them to maximize the remaining values:

- Agent 0 can take item 5, as they value it at 51, which is the highest remaining value for item 5.
- Agent 2 can take item 1, as they value it at 46, which is the highest remaining value for item 1.

With this allocation, we ensure each agent gets at least one item, maximizing the overall valuation based on the given preferences.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
