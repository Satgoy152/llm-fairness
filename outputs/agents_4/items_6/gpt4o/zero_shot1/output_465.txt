Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  93  76  78  72  25
1  21  42  91  18  47  64
2  45  42  19  77  56  40
3  42  21  91  56  15   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately the same total value, considering that each agent must receive an integer number of items. We will make sure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 6, as per the given table. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. List the items each agent values the most, trying to maximize the fairness:
   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 3 are highly valued (93 and 78).
   - Agent 1: Item 2 is highly valued (91).
   - Agent 2: Item 3 is highly valued (77).
   - Agent 3: Item 2 is highly valued (91).

2. Try to balance allocations based on the above preferences and values:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1: Allocate items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2: Allocate item 3.
- Agent 3: Allocate item 0.

3. Verify the allocation:
   - Agent 0 receives items 1, 5 with values: 93, 25 (total: 118).
   - Agent 1 receives items 2, 4 with values: 91, 47 (total: 138).
   - Agent 2 receives item 3 with value: 77 (total: 77).
   - Agent 3 receives item 0 with value: 42 (total: 42).

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated, totaling 6 items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
