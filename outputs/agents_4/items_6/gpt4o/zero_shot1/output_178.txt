Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2   7  31  17  83  86
1  77  71   0   5  34  43
2  44  21   9  40  28  99
3  96  70  13  54  68  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of exactly 6 items allocated. One approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations and aim for a balanced distribution:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0.

Now, let's allocate the items based on maximizing the total value for each agent:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (second-highest value).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (second-highest value).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value).

The allocation can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while attempting to maximize the total value each agent receives.
