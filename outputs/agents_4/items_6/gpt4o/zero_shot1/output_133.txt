Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  31  31  37  20  72
1  62   6   1  68  14  36
2   8  94  26  45  42   9
3  90  11  54  41  51  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we could consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. One common approach is to use a variation of the "highest bidder" method, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate the highest values for each item and allocate accordingly:

- Item 0: Highest value is 90 by Agent 3.
- Item 1: Highest value is 94 by Agent 2.
- Item 2: Highest value is 54 by Agent 3.
- Item 3: Highest value is 68 by Agent 1.
- Item 4: Highest value is 51 by Agent 3.
- Item 5: Highest value is 72 by Agent 0.

Based on this allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets items 0, 2, and 4.

Now, presenting the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
