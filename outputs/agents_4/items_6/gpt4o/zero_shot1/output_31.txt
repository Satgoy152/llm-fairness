Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  47  62  30  32  87
1  37  76  96  44  82  89
2  68  74  19  63  52  76
3  40  48  11  95  11  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we can use a simple heuristic to maximize the total value for each agent. One way to do this is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the items one by one and allocate them accordingly:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 19
   - Agent 1 values it at 37
   - Agent 2 values it at 68
   - Agent 3 values it at 40

   Agent 2 values item 0 the most.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 47
   - Agent 1 values it at 76
   - Agent 2 values it at 74
   - Agent 3 values it at 48

   Agent 1 values item 1 the most.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 62
   - Agent 1 values it at 96
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - Agent 3 values it at 11

   Agent 1 values item 2 the most.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 30
   - Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Agent 2 values it at 63
   - Agent 3 values it at 95

   Agent 3 values item 3 the most.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 32
   - Agent 1 values it at 82
   - Agent 2 values it at 52
   - Agent 3 values it at 11

   Agent 1 values item 4 the most.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 87
   - Agent 1 values it at 89
   - Agent 2 values it at 76
   - Agent 3 values it at 30

   Agent 1 values item 5 the most.

After assigning items based on the highest valuation, we have:

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, maximizing fairness based on the given valuations.
