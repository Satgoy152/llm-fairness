Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  47  84   6  69  67
1   1  40  95  72  18  63
2   3  31  45  67  38  20
3  80   5  79  77  90  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent, considering that each agent should receive a roughly equal number of items. Given there are 4 agents and 6 items, some agents will receive one item while others will receive two.

One possible allocation strategy is to assign items based on the highest value for each agent, while also ensuring all items are allocated. Here is a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value: 84)
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value: 95), but item 2 is already allocated.
   - Next highest value item: Item 3 (value: 72)
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value: 67), but item 3 is already allocated.
   - Next highest value item: Item 2 (value: 45), but item 2 is already allocated.
   - Next highest value item: Item 4 (value: 38)
   - Assign item 4 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value: 90), but item 4 is already allocated.
   - Next highest value item: Item 0 (value: 80)
   - Assign item 0 to agent 3.

Now, each agent has one item, and we have two remaining items (1 and 5) to allocate:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Remaining items: 1 (value: 47), 5 (value: 67)
   - Assign item 5 to agent 0 (highest value among remaining).

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Remaining item: 1 (value: 40)
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
