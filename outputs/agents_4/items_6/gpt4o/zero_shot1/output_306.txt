Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  17  46  38  97  66
1  84  25  31  43  60   9
2  54  84  76  79  73  63
3  46  89  50  66  66  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 84 76 79 73 63]
 [46 89 50 66 66 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We can use a simple greedy approach to achieve this:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item that hasn't already been allocated.
2. Continue assigning the next highest valued remaining item to each agent while maintaining the constraint of the total number of items.

Let's allocate the items based on the table provided:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (97), Item 0 (80)
   - Allocate: Item 4

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (84), Item 3 (43)
   - Allocate: Item 0

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (84), Item 3 (79)
   - Allocate: Item 1

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (89), Item 5 (84)
   - Allocate: Item 5

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2, 3) to the agents:

5. **Remaining items**:
   - Item 2 and Item 3 are left to be allocated.

   - **Agent 0**: Next highest value is Item 2 (46)
   - **Agent 1**: Next highest value is Item 3 (43)
   - Allocating Item 2 to Agent 0 and Item 3 to Agent 1

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed optimally based on the agents' valuations.
