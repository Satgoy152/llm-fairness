Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96   6  67  82  46  65
1  68  15  93  51  89  57
2  48  34  64  40  29  37
3  71  34  33  26  14  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that considers the preferences of each agent for the items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 0 the highest with a valuation of 96. We'll allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the highest with a valuation of 93. We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 with a valuation of 64 but since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 1, we look for the next highest valuation. Agent 2 values item 0 with a valuation of 48, but since item 0 is allocated to Agent 0, we give them item 5 (valuation of 37).
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 with a valuation of 71, but it's already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest valuation is item 5 with a value of 47, but itâ€™s allocated to Agent 2, so we allocate item 1 (valuation of 34).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 0, try to give the next highest available item which is item 3 (valuation of 82).
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 2, can take item 4 (valuation of 89)

The allocations with these considerations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed based on the highest valuations available to each agent.
