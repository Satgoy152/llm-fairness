Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  22  37  97  57  98
1  13   9  89  42  69  99
2  37  82  78   4  74  38
3  49  17  84  57  65  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37 82 78  4 74 38]
 [49 17 84 57 65 72]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible and that the distribution is as fair as possible.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Assign item 5 to agent 1, as they value it the highest at 99.
- Assign item 0 to agent 0, as they value it the highest at 84.
- Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they value it at 89, which is the highest remaining value.
- Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they value it the highest at 82.
- Assign item 4 to agent 3, as they value it the highest at 65.
- Assign item 3 to agent 0, as they value it the highest at 97.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total value derived by each agent is relatively high based on their individual valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
