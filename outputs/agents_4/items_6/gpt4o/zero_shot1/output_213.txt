Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76   3  88  34  36  93
1  82  97  60  78  60  51
2  45  43  28  37  68  51
3  58  84   3  88  75  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 43 28 37 68 51]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Evaluate the highest valuation for each item**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring agents get a fair share.

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**:
   - Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 1 (82).
   - Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 1 (97).
   - Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 0 (88).
   - Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 3 (88).
   - Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 3 (75).
   - Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 0 (93).

3. **Review and Adjust**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more items than they should, taking into account the fairness:
   - Agent 0 gets items 2 and 5.
   - Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 2 initially gets no item, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (since Agent 3 has two items and Agent 2 needs one).
   - Agent 3 gets item 3.

With these steps, the final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
