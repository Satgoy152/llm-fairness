Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  21  45  44  47  34
1  66  42  36  95  38  54
2  56  66  85  65  97  60
3  25  93  18  46  27  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. This problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm or other allocation strategies. Let's proceed with a simple allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, adjusting if necessary.

Let's analyze the valuations and perform the allocation:

- **Item 0**:
  - Agent 0: 46
  - Agent 1: 66 (highest)
  - Agent 2: 56
  - Agent 3: 25
  - Assign to Agent 1.

- **Item 1**:
  - Agent 0: 21
  - Agent 1: 42
  - Agent 2: 66 (highest)
  - Agent 3: 93
  - Assign to Agent 3.

- **Item 2**:
  - Agent 0: 45
  - Agent 1: 36
  - Agent 2: 85 (highest)
  - Agent 3: 18
  - Assign to Agent 2.

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0: 44
  - Agent 1: 95 (highest)
  - Agent 2: 65
  - Agent 3: 46
  - Assign to Agent 1.

- **Item 4**:
  - Agent 0: 47
  - Agent 1: 38
  - Agent 2: 97 (highest)
  - Agent 3: 27
  - Assign to Agent 2.

- **Item 5**:
  - Agent 0: 34
  - Agent 1: 54 (highest)
  - Agent 2: 60
  - Agent 3: 13
  - Assign to Agent 2.

However, from the above allocations, Agent 0 has not received any items. We need to adjust this to ensure each agent gets at least one item. Let's reassign:

- Reassign Item 0 (from Agent 1 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 has the second-highest valuation for this item).

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4, 5
- Agent 3: Item 1

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```
