Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  81  31  54  71  75
1  23  93  97  65  42  53
2  80  97  36  96  86  18
3  94  49  33  51  80  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[17 81 31 54 71 75]
 [23 93 97 65 42 53]
 [80 97 36 96 86 18]
 [94 49 33 51 80 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Check which items have the highest valuations for each agent.

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Total Satisfaction**: Allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

3. **Ensure Each Agent is Considered**: Even if an agent receives no items, they should be included in the final allocation.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  81  31  54  71  75
1  23  93  97  65  42  53
2  80  97  36  96  86  18
3  94  49  33  51  80  62
```

### Allocation Plan:
- **Agent 0**: The highest-valued items for Agent 0 are items 1, 5, and 4. However, to balance with other agents, we choose items 1 and 5 which provide significant value.
- **Agent 1**: The highest-valued item for Agent 1 is item 2. Assign this item to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: The highest-valued items are 1 and 3, but item 1 is already allocated. So, we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: The highest-valued item for Agent 3 is item 0. This item is allocated to Agent 3. Also, item 4 provides good value and is not yet allocated.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total number of items allocated is 6, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations.
