Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46   7  19  27   1  59
1  35   1  88  20  64   2
2  25  98  51  26  12  77
3  14  12   7  70  53  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We have 4 agents and 6 items, so not every agent will receive an item, but we should try to optimize the allocation based on the given valuations.

Let's consider the values each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0 values: [46, 7, 19, 27, 1, 59]
- Agent 1 values: [35, 1, 88, 20, 64, 2]
- Agent 2 values: [25, 98, 51, 26, 12, 77]
- Agent 3 values: [14, 12, 7, 70, 53, 48]

We want to maximize total satisfaction, which generally involves giving each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets items in a fair manner. However, with more agents than items, not all will receive an item.

The highest valuations for each item by any agent are:
- Item 0: Agent 0 (46)
- Item 1: Agent 2 (98)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (88)
- Item 3: Agent 3 (70)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (64)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (59)

A reasonable allocation is:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items [2, 4]
- Agent 2 gets items [1]
- Agent 3 gets items [3]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
