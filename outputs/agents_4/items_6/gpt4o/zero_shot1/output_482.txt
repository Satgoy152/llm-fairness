Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  52   0   8  85  31
1  57  42   7  78  15  52
2  39  71  29  81  29  49
3  58  65  33   1  75  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[45 52  0  8 85 31]
 [57 42  7 78 15 52]
 [39 71 29 81 29 49]
 [58 65 33  1 75 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the agents' valuations for each item and try to maximize the total utility while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations = [45, 52, 0, 8, 85, 31]
   - Assign item 4 (valuation 85) to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued item for them.

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations = [57, 42, 7, 78, 15, 52]
   - Assign item 3 (valuation 78) to Agent 1, as it is the highest valued item for them.

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations = [39, 71, 29, 81, 29, 49]
   - Assign item 1 (valuation 71) to Agent 2, as it is a high-valued item for them.

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations = [58, 65, 33, 1, 75, 64]
   - Assign item 0 (valuation 58) to Agent 3, as it is a high-valued item for them.

Now, two items remain unallocated (items 2 and 5). We can allocate these based on the next highest valuations:

5. **Agent 2**: 
   - Assign item 5 (valuation 49) to Agent 2, as it is the next highest valued unallocated item for them.

6. **Agent 3**:
   - Assign item 2 (valuation 33) to Agent 3, as it is the next highest valued unallocated item for them.

The allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is six.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
