Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  83  50  31  99  89
1  20  83  36  96  47  54
2  75  83  56  65  23  67
3  99   0  17  19  99  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations for the items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by identifying the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Avoid conflicts by checking if the item is already allocated, and if not, allocate it to the agent.
3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Letâ€™s proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (99).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (96).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (75).
- Agent 3 values item 0 and item 4 equally the highest (99), but item 0 is already allocated to Agent 2, so we allocate item 5, which is the next highest unallocated item for Agent 3.

Now, let's assign the remaining items based on the highest remaining value:

- Item 1 is valued equally by Agents 0, 1, and 2 (83). Since Agent 0 has the highest overall valuation, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Item 2 is valued by Agent 2 the highest (56).

With this allocation strategy, here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed across the agents fairly based on their valuations.
