Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  29  48  11  20  71
1  85  52  24   9   8  51
2  47  48  81  39  21  70
3  59  44  81  95  14  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives a fair and reasonable number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has for any item and attempt to allocate those items first, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
2. Then, allocate remaining items to agents based on the next highest values.

Using this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (value 75)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (value 52)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (value 81)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value 95)
- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 71, since they value it highly and it hasn’t been allocated yet)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (value 8, as it’s the remaining item and they have a value for it)

This allocation results in the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed in a way that considers the high valuation each agent places on the items they receive. Note that some agents may end up with more than one item because they have higher valuations for the remaining items.
