Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  94   3  38  88  78
1  32  77  27  21   1  40
2  98  79  30  31  32  48
3  58  54  84  48  13  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 54 84 48 13 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the total valuation and distributes items as equitably as possible. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's consider this strategy:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most (98).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (94).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the most (84).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most (48).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most (88).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most (91).

However, this allocation would give Agent 3 more items than others. To ensure each agent has at least one item, let's adjust the allocation:

- Assign **Item 0** to Agent 2 (98).
- Assign **Item 1** to Agent 0 (94).
- Assign **Item 2** to Agent 3 (84).
- Assign **Item 3** to Agent 1 (21).
- Assign **Item 4** to Agent 0 (88).
- Assign **Item 5** to Agent 3 (91).

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and tries to maximize their total valuation.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
