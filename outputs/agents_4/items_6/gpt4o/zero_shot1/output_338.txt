Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  25  91  83   3  10
1  45  79  66   5  91  45
2  97  34  43  72  70  21
3  87  63  85  53  78  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 63 85 53 78 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will attempt to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (91).
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (91).
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (97).
   - Assign item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (87), but item 0 is already assigned.
   - Next highest is item 2 (85), but item 2 is also already assigned.
   - Next highest is item 4 (78), but item 4 is also already assigned.
   - Next highest is item 3 (53).
   - Assign item 3 to agent 3.

5. Remaining items are 1 and 5, which need to be allocated:
   - Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 1 (25).
   - Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 5 (45).

6. Assign item 1 to agent 0 and item 5 to agent 1.

The allocations based on the above process are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their highest valuations. Each agent receives at least one item.
