Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  60  72   6  76  20
1  78  28   0  50  24  53
2  89  86  22  30  36  20
3  88  34  39  19  69  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[48 60 72  6 76 20]
 [78 28  0 50 24 53]
 [89 86 22 30 36 20]
 [88 34 39 19 69 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and only 6 items are allocated in total.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 2: Value 72
   - Item 4: Value 76
   - Total Value: 148

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0: Value 78
   - Total Value: 78

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 1: Value 86
   - Item 5: Value 20
   - Total Value: 106

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 3: Value 19
   - Total Value: 19

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed, each agent gets at least one item, and the total utility is maximized based on the given values.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
