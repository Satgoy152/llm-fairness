Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  72  10  23  35  53
1  11  13  38  21  89   9
2  89  42  80  51  70   4
3  63  71   6   9  51  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 13 38 21 89  9]
 [89 42 80 51 70  4]
 [63 71  6  9 51 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that attempts to maximize overall satisfaction, i.e., agents receive items they value highly.

Let's examine the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  72  10  23  35  53
1  11  13  38  21  89   9
2  89  42  80  51  70   4
3  63  71   6   9  51  21
```

We can attempt to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total value. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (value = 72) and item 5 (value = 53). Total value for Agent 0 = 72 + 53 = 125.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 (value = 89). Total value for Agent 1 = 89.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 0 (value = 89) and item 2 (value = 80). Total value for Agent 2 = 89 + 80 = 169.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 (value = 9). Total value for Agent 3 = 9.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
