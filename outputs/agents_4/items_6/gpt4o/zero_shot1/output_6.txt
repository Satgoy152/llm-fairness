Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  18  29  41  52  58
1  51  82  65   5  39  45
2  17  34  37  31   4  36
3  17  87  51  45  25  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's aim to distribute the items such that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. 

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: [49, 18, 29, 41, 52, 58]
- Agent 1: [51, 82, 65, 5, 39, 45]
- Agent 2: [17, 34, 37, 31, 4, 36]
- Agent 3: [17, 87, 51, 45, 25, 41]

Step by step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (51).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (87).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (65).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (41).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (52).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (58).

Let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item where possible:

- Agent 0 receives Items 3, 4, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 3 receives Item 1.
- Agent 2 does not receive any item as they donâ€™t have the highest valuation for any and others have higher preferences.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1]
}
```
