Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  42  58  52  76   5
1  88  82  50  85  32  18
2  88  18  28  99  33  65
3  31  57  51  44  75  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations, let's allocate the items in a way that aims to balance the total valuations:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for an item and allocate that item to the agent first. Then proceed to allocate the remaining items based on maximizing individual agent's total value.

Let's go through the allocation step-by-step:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 4 (76).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0 (88).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3 (99).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 4 (75), but since item 4 is already allocated, the next highest value for them is item 1 (57).

After the first round, items 0, 3, and 4 are allocated. We now proceed with the remaining items.

- Agent 0 would next prefer item 2 (58).
- Agent 1 would next prefer item 3 (85), but it is already allocated. The next best is item 1 (82).
- Agent 2 would next prefer item 5 (65).
- Agent 3 would next prefer item 2 (51), but it is already allocated to Agent 0. The next best is item 5 (38), but it is already allocated to Agent 2.

Adjust the allocation to ensure that all items are allocated with no overlaps:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, since item 3 is already with them, and they have a high value for it.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it was their second choice.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, balancing their total valuation.

Now let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6.
