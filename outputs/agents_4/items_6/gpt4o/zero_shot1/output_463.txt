Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  63  71  96  19   6
1  15   9  45  26  87  52
2  52  61  52  50  71  71
3  22  18  31  95  81  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can approach the problem by considering each agent's valuation of the items and attempting to maximize the total satisfaction (valuation) while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. 

One possible way to distribute the items is by using a greedy approach, where we iteratively assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring no agent gets more than their fair share (given there are 4 agents and 6 items).

Let's examine the table and allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

- Item 3 (valued highest by agent 0 at 96) is allocated to agent 0.
- Item 4 (valued highest by agent 1 at 87) is allocated to agent 1.
- Item 5 (valued highest by agent 3 at 84) is allocated to agent 3.
- Item 2 (valued highest by agent 0 at 71) is allocated to agent 0.
- Item 1 (valued highest by agent 0 at 63) is allocated to agent 0.
- Item 0 (valued highest by agent 2 at 52) is allocated to agent 2.

Thus, based on the above allocation, the JSON format would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 6 items are distributed among the 4 agents.
