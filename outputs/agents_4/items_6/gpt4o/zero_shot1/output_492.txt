Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  61  27  18  68  71
1  61  30  49  76  61  83
2  85  56  95  71  93  92
3  75  13  40  94  47  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for a distribution that maximizes the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for item 5 (71) and item 4 (68).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for item 5 (83) and item 3 (76).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for item 2 (95) and item 4 (93).
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for item 3 (94) and item 0 (75).

We should look to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction. Here's one potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 (68) and item 0 (42).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (83) and item 3 (76).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (95).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 1 (13).

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and that agents receive items that they value significantly.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation considers the high valuations while ensuring each agent receives items, and all items are distributed.
