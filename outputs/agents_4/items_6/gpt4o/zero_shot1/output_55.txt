Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  96  57  98  10  90
1   3  84  56  45  32   0
2  95  73   0  60  44  73
3  11  91   5  25   5  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 98. Assign item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 84. Assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 95. Assign item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (which is already taken), so check the next highest available item. Item 5 is valued at 68. Assign item 5 to agent 3.

Now, two items remain unallocated: items 2 and 4.

5. **Agent 0**: For the remaining items, agent 0 values item 2 at 57, which is the highest available. Assign item 2 to agent 0.

6. **Agent 2**: For the remaining item, agent 2 values item 4 at 44, which is the highest available. Assign item 4 to agent 2.

All items are now allocated. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
