Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  47  19  22  76   2
1  70  61  66  75  55   0
2  31  47  22  79  93  48
3  59   8  70  68  36  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations given in the table. The goal is to maximize the satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations for the items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value for item 4 (76).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for item 3 (75).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value for item 4 (93), but it's already allocated to Agent 0. Next highest is item 3 (79), but it's allocated to Agent 1. Next, item 5 (48).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value for item 2 (70).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- **Item 0:** 
  - Agent 1 has the highest value (70), but already has item 3. Agent 3 has the next highest value (59).

- **Item 1:**
  - Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value item 1 (47) the same, but Agent 0 has only one item and Agent 2 has one item, so Agent 0 can take it.

- **Item 2:**
  - Already allocated to Agent 3.

Now we check the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 has item 3.
- Agent 2 has item 5.
- Agent 3 has item 0 and 2.

This allocation maximizes the agents' satisfaction based on their highest valuations and ensures each agent gets a fair share.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This ensures all 6 items are allocated fairly.
