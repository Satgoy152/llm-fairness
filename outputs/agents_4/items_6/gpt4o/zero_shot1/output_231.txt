Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  54   3   6  23   1
1  74  69  22  80  69  87
2   9  30  34  98  13   5
3  98  22  54  80  33  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 54  3  6 23  1]
 [74 69 22 80 69 87]
 [ 9 30 34 98 13  5]
 [98 22 54 80 33 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We can achieve this by selecting the highest-valued items for each agent, keeping in mind the constraint of only 6 items in total. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (91), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most (87), so allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (98), so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (98), but since item 0 is already allocated to agent 0, allocate item 1 to agent 3, as it is the next highest valued item for agent 3 (22).

Now we have allocated 4 items. Next, allocate the remaining items:

5. Allocate item 4 to agent 1, as it has a high value (69) and is unallocated.
6. Allocate item 2 to agent 2, as it has a moderate value (34) for agent 2 and is unallocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
