Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  94  56   8  90  40
1  46   6  41   3  67  72
2  73  57  91   7  33  25
3  29  77   4  63  87  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46  6 41  3 67 72]
 [73 57 91  7 33 25]
 [29 77  4 63 87 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total valuation, while ensuring all items are distributed. Here is a possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 and item 0 the highest.

Given these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign item 1 and item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 and item 3 to Agent 3.

This ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it highly, while keeping the distribution fair. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
