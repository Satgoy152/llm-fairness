Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  73  37  89  41  45
1  40  76  36  51  31  21
2  86  42  57  15  22  29
3  54  90  46  98  99  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach. One strategy is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed with the given table:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each item is assigned only once.

Let's allocate the items based on the maximum valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most with 86.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most with 90.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most with 57.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most with 98.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most with 99.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most with 96.

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives no items.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 3 receives items 1, 3, 4, and 5.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
