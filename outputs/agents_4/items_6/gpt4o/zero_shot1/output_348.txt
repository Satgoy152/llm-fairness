Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  85  70   9  94  40
1  79  69  76  95  69  10
2  11  61   4  86  85  71
3  52  76  49  47  58  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 85 70  9 94 40]
 [79 69 76 95 69 10]
 [11 61  4 86 85 71]
 [52 76 49 47 58 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the values each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 94.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 95.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 86, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 4 at 85, but it's also taken. The next highest is item 5 at 71.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 76.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 2:

5. Agent 0 values item 2 the second highest at 70.
6. Agent 1 values item 0 the second highest at 79.

The allocations based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each has at least one item and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1]
}
```
