Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11   8  51  36   4  80
1  73  82  65  60  93  40
2  14   3   9   4  73  17
3  48  29   9  87  87  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it most.
2. Ensure that no agent receives more than a fair share of items (in this case, no more than 2 items, as there are 4 agents and 6 items).

Let's evaluate each item based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (73).
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (82).
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (51).
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (87).
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (93).
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (80).

Initial allocation based on highest valuations:

- Agent 0: [2, 5] (valuations: 51, 80)
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 4] (valuations: 73, 82, 93)
- Agent 3: [3] (valuations: 87)

Agent 1 has more than 2 items, so we need to reassign one item. The next highest valuation for item 0 after agent 1 is agent 3 (48). Reassign item 0 to agent 3.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0, 3]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and no agent has more than 2 items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
