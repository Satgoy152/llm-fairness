Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  71  12   9  80  18
1  32  13  27  36  56  83
2  70  72  44  68  63  92
3  77  23  94   2  40  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 72 44 68 63 92]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given the valuations provided, we need to distribute the 6 items among the 4 agents. Let's analyze the values and allocate the items accordingly.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuation for items 0 and 4 (45 and 80, respectively).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 5 (83).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuation for item 5 and 3 (92 and 68, respectively).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 5 (98) and a high valuation for item 2 (94).

Given these insights, we can propose an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Assign items 0 and 4. This gives Agent 0 a total value of 45 + 80 = 125.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Assign item 3. This gives Agent 1 a total value of 36.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Assign item 1. This gives Agent 2 a total value of 72.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Assign items 2 and 5. This gives Agent 3 a total value of 94 + 98 = 192.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
