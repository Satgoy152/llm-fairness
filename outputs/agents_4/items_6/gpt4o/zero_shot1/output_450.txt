Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  24  28  34  45  40
1  50  51  74  26  52  40
2  47  89  10  84  98  88
3  46  86   1  16  62  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that reflects their preferences or valuations while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s a possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent:** We look for items that have high valuations by each agent and try to allocate those first.

2. **Avoid conflicts:** If two agents highly value the same item, we may need to find a compromise based on overall valuations.

3. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item:** Since we have 4 agents and 6 items, we can try to give each agent at least one item.

4. **Balance allocations:** Ensure that the remaining items are distributed to maximize the overall valuation.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: Value 81 (highest valuation for agent 0)
  
- Agent 1:
  - Item 2: Value 74 (highest valuation for agent 1)
  - Item 5: Value 40 (additional item to meet fair allocation)

- Agent 2:
  - Item 4: Value 98 (highest valuation for agent 2)

- Agent 3:
  - Item 1: Value 86 (highest valuation for agent 3)
  - Item 3: Value 16 (additional item to meet fair allocation)

Now, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and it attempts to maximize the total utility based on their valuations.
