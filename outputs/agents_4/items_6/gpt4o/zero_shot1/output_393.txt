Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  97  26  72   9  91
1  52  81   9   6  17  80
2   1   9  92  67   5  76
3  21  75   7   1  33  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item across all agents** to determine which agent values each item the most.

2. **Allocate items based on maximum value**, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Balance the allocation** to ensure fairness if any one agent receives a disproportionately high total value compared to others.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 45. Let's assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 97. Assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 92. Assign it to Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 72, which is higher than others. Assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most at 33. Assign it to Agent 3.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 91. Assign it to Agent 0.

Now, Agent 0 has four items which is not fair. Let's adjust:

- Reassign **Item 3** to Agent 2, who values it second highest at 67.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the value among agents while ensuring each item is allocated fairly.
