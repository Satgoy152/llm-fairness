Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  67  71  54  52  41
1  52   5  70  84  12  36
2  19   8  59  95  58  15
3  50   6  91   3  28   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52  5 70 84 12 36]
 [19  8 59 95 58 15]
 [50  6 91  3 28  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, given that we have 4 agents and 6 items.

Let's break down the allocations step by step:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 95.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 84.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 95, but item 3 is already taken by Agent 1.
   - The next highest value for Agent 2 is item 2 at 59.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 91, but item 2 is already taken by Agent 2.
   - The next highest value for Agent 3 is item 0 at 50, but item 0 is already taken by Agent 0.
   - The next highest value for Agent 3 is item 4 at 28.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 1 and 5 are unallocated.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as it has the highest remaining value for Agent 0 at 67.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 as it has the highest remaining value for Agent 1 at 36.

Now, we have allocated all 6 items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
