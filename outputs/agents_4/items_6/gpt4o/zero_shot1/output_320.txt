Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  95  26   4  12  73
1  26  50  81  63  77  59
2  69  54  55  48  31  36
3  54  73  86  49  57  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here, we need to consider the preferences of each agent and try to distribute the items so that the overall satisfaction is balanced.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (95), Item 5 (73)
   - Allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (81), Item 4 (77)
   - Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (69)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (49)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
