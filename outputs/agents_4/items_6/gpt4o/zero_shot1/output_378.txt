Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55   5  90   4  98  31
1  15  86  85  29  95   2
2  61  72  97  36  23  18
3  97  86  36  52  58  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction or value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the values each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0: [55, 5, 90, 4, 98, 31]
- Agent 1: [15, 86, 85, 29, 95, 2]
- Agent 2: [61, 72, 97, 36, 23, 18]
- Agent 3: [97, 86, 36, 52, 58, 54]

To maximize fairness and satisfaction, we can assign items based on the highest value each agent places on them. However, we need to ensure that all items are distributed, and each agent can potentially receive an item.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. For item 0, Agent 3 values it the highest at 97.
2. For item 1, Agent 1 and Agent 3 both value it at 86, but we'll give it to Agent 1 to balance allocations.
3. For item 2, Agent 2 values it the highest at 97.
4. For item 3, Agent 3 values it the highest at 52.
5. For item 4, Agent 0 values it the highest at 98.
6. For item 5, Agent 0 values it the highest at 31.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
