Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  73  96  42  72  58
1  40  34  43  79   9  26
2  11  44  36  67  47  41
3  41  34  16  38  19  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 44 36 67 47 41]
 [41 34 16 38 19 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize overall satisfaction by considering each agent's preferences for the items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

### Initial Valuations:

```
Agent 0: [96, 73, 96, 42, 72, 58]
Agent 1: [40, 34, 43, 79, 9, 26]
Agent 2: [11, 44, 36, 67, 47, 41]
Agent 3: [41, 34, 16, 38, 19, 33]
```

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0, value = 96.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0, value = 73.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0, value = 96.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 1, value = 79.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0, value = 72 (already has 3 items, so consider next).
   - Next high valuation: Agent 2, value = 47.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0, value = 58 (already has 3 items, so consider next).
   - Next high valuation: Agent 2, value = 41.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their preferences, with Agent 0 receiving the items they value most, and the remaining items distributed to maximize the satisfaction of Agents 1 and 2. Agent 3 does not receive any items in this allocation.
