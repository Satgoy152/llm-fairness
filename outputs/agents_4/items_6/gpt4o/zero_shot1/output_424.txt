Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  43  23  85  33  53
1  16  66  40  71  67  99
2   8  97  93  60  97  29
3  99   4  43  78  24  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has relatively lower values overall compared to others. We can give them item 0, which they value at 7.

2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 5, which they value at 99. We allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. Agent 2 has high values for both items 1 and 4, valuing them at 97 each. We allocate items 1 and 4 to agent 2.

4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 78, so we allocate item 3 to agent 3. Agent 3 also has a high value for item 2, valuing it at 43. We allocate item 2 to agent 3 as well.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of items based on their valuations.
