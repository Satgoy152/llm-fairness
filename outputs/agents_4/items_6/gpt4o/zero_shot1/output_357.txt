Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  44  50  75  36  68
1  30  82  25  47  32  79
2  85  41  61  55  27  18
3  24  93  59  24  33  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value each agent gets. We'll attempt to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair distribution based on their valuations. Here's one approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their received value while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the step-by-step allocation:

- Calculate the total value for each agent:
  - Agent 0: 46 + 44 + 50 + 75 + 36 + 68 = 319
  - Agent 1: 30 + 82 + 25 + 47 + 32 + 79 = 295
  - Agent 2: 85 + 41 + 61 + 55 + 27 + 18 = 287
  - Agent 3: 24 + 93 + 59 + 24 + 33 + 26 = 259

- Assign the items to maximize individual agent satisfaction:
  - Agent 0: Items 3 and 5 (75 + 68 = 143)
  - Agent 1: Items 1 and 4 (82 + 32 = 114)
  - Agent 2: Items 0 and 2 (85 + 61 = 146)
  - Agent 3: No items allocated

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution based on their highest valued items.
