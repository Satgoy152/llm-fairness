Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  85  81   8  94  87
1  30  47  21  91  22  35
2  22  61  59   3  56  10
3  21  58  89  11  93  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51 85 81  8 94 87]
 [30 47 21 91 22 35]
 [22 61 59  3 56 10]
 [21 58 89 11 93 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated and all agents are considered. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value for item 4 (94).

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest value for item 3 (91).

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest value for item 1 (61).

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest value for item 2 (89).

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 5.

5. **Agent 0:** 
   - Second highest value for item 5 (87).

6. **Agent 2:** 
   - Second highest value for item 0 (22).

This distribution ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the valuations are fairly distributed based on their preferences. Hereâ€™s the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
