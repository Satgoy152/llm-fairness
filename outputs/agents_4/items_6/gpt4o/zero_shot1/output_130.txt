Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  98  89  12  52  12
1  69   9  91  93  40  45
2   7   2  17  12  97  21
3  96  22  68  61  98  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 0 98 89 12 52 12]

 [ 7  2 17 12 97 21]
 [96 22 68 61 98 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation based on the given preferences of each agent for the items. Since there are 4 agents and 6 items, not every agent will receive an item. We should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction based on the valuations.

We'll consider each item's highest valuation and assign it to the corresponding agent, ensuring each agent can receive an integer number of items.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 with a value of 96.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 98.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 91.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 93.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 with a value of 98.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 with a value of 88.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item [1]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 3]
- **Agent 2**: []
- **Agent 3**: Items [0, 4, 5]

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed to maximize the total value based on the given preferences, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
