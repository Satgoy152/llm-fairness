Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  49   2  22  94  84
1  70  36  10  75  79  93
2   9  69  14  11  33  80
3  88  18  35  93  19  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we should consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to maximize overall satisfaction. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 94
   - Agent 1 values it at 70
   - Agent 2 values it at 9
   - Agent 3 values it at 88
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 94)

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Agent 2 values it at 69
   - Agent 3 values it at 18
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 69)

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 2
   - Agent 1 values it at 10
   - Agent 2 values it at 14
   - Agent 3 values it at 35
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (highest value: 35)

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 22
   - Agent 1 values it at 75
   - Agent 2 values it at 11
   - Agent 3 values it at 93
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (highest value: 93)

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 94
   - Agent 1 values it at 79
   - Agent 2 values it at 33
   - Agent 3 values it at 19
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 94)

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 93
   - Agent 2 values it at 80
   - Agent 3 values it at 94
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (highest value: 94)

Now, let's ensure each agent has at least one item if possible. Agent 1 currently has no items. Reallocate item 5 from Agent 3 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 has the second highest valuation for this item, and Agent 3 already has items.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 3]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
