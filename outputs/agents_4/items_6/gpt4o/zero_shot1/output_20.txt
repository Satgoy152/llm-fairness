Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  10  32   0  53  99
1  87  77  16  65  65  21
2  47  45  52  28  10  78
3  12  29  36  20  98  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 77 16 65 65 21]
 [47 45 52 28 10 78]
 [12 29 36 20 98 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

To do this, we can use a greedy approach, assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Since we have 6 items and 4 agents, two agents will receive 1 item each, and two agents will receive 2 items each.

Step 1: Determine the highest value for each item and its respective agent.
- Item 0: Agent 1 (87)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (77)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (32)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (65)
- Item 4: Agent 3 (98)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (99)

Step 2: Allocate items to ensure each agent gets at least one item.
- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (highest value for item 0)
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (highest value for item 1)
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (highest value for item 2)
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (second highest value for item 3, since agent 1 has already received two items)
- Assign item 4 to agent 3 (highest value for item 4)
- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (highest value for item 5)

This results in the following allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 5
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1
- Agent 2 receives item 3
- Agent 3 receives item 4

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
