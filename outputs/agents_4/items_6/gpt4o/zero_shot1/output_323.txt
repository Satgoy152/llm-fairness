Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  84  86  55  22  70
1  28  10  56  36  95  28
2  71  92   7  36  60  66
3  67  83  85   7  96  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction or value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 6 items and 4 agents, with each agent needing to get at least one item, we'll attempt to distribute the items so that the overall allocation is as fair as possible in terms of value.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (86), 1 (84), and 0 (70).
   - Let's allocate item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (95).
   - Let's allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (92) and 0 (71).
   - Let's allocate item 1 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 (96), 1 (83), and 0 (67).
   - Since item 4 is already allocated, let's allocate item 0 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items and need to distribute the remaining 2 items. Let's consider the remaining items (3 and 5):

5. **Unallocated Items (3 and 5)**:
   - Item 3: Highest remaining valuations are for agent 0 (55) and agent 2 (36).
   - Item 5: Highest remaining valuations are for agent 2 (66) and agent 0 (70).

- Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (since agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 3).
- Allocate item 5 to agent 2 (since agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 5).

Thus, the allocations would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, while attempting to distribute the items in a way that respects the highest valuations as much as possible.
