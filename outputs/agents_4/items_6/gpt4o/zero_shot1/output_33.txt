Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  72  98  41  52   4
1  70  71  41  54  75  41
2  62  96   4  73   9  36
3   3  95  58  65  77  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. This is a combinatorial optimization problem, often solved using algorithms like the Hungarian method or other assignment algorithms. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Allocate item 2 (value 98) to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Allocate item 4 (value 75) to Agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Allocate item 1 (value 96) to Agent 2.
   
4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Allocate items 0 (value 3), 3 (value 65), and 5 (value 33) to Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to distribute items such that each agent receives at least one item with a high valuation, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the 4 agents.
