Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  92  59   0  99  43
1   1  61  97  84  81  44
2  65  71  18  74  77  45
3  68  16  39  59  74  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuations: Item 4 (99)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuations: Item 2 (97), Item 3 (84)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuations: Item 1 (71), Item 4 (77)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - High valuations: Item 5 (77)

Based on the valuations, let's allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: [4] (highest valuation for item 4)
- **Agent 1**: [2, 3] (high valuations for items 2 and 3)
- **Agent 2**: [1] (high valuation for item 1)
- **Agent 3**: [0, 5] (high valuation for item 5, and a decent valuation for item 0)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while considering an agent's highest preferences. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
