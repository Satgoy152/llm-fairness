Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  90  73  26  18  72
1  47  86  14  56  80  27
2  26  77  66  27  88  25
3  95   4  90  21   1  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we'll use an approach that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given that there are 4 agents and 6 items, we'll aim to balance the distribution as evenly as possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as [47, 90, 73, 26, 18, 72]
- Agent 1 values items as [47, 86, 14, 56, 80, 27]
- Agent 2 values items as [26, 77, 66, 27, 88, 25]
- Agent 3 values items as [95, 4, 90, 21, 1, 85]

We'll allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

1. Assign items to the agent that values them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are allocated.

Following this approach, the allocation can be:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 3 (Value: 95)
- Item 1: Assign to Agent 0 (Value: 90)
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 3 (Value: 90)
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 1 (Value: 56)
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 2 (Value: 88)
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 0 (Value: 72)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
