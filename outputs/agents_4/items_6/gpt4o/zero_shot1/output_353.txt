Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  71  60  83   2  40
1  44  79  79  45   0  12
2  52  90  45  92  87  26
3  77  14  48   4   0   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, given that there are 4 agents and 6 items. Our goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 3 and 1. 
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 4.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0.

Let's allocate based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction and ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 3 by Agent 2).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 4 by Agent 2).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value for item 0 by Agent 3).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest value for item 1 by Agent 0, after Agent 2 who already has two items).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 2 by Agent 1, after Agent 2 who already has two items).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (remaining item, Agent 0 has an average valuation compared to others).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
