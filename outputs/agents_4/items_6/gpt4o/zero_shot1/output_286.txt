Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  60  45  22  82  65
1  90  25  91  74  96  11
2  85  23  78  45  80  62
3  32  38  10  30  18  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 25 91 74 96 11]
 [85 23 78 45 80 62]
 [32 38 10 30 18 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent or distribute the items such that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged. Given the valuation table, we will analyze potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [39, 60, 45, 22, 82, 65]
   - Highest values: 82 (item 4), 65 (item 5)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [90, 25, 91, 74, 96, 11]
   - Highest values: 96 (item 4), 91 (item 2)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [85, 23, 78, 45, 80, 62]
   - Highest values: 85 (item 0), 80 (item 4)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [32, 38, 10, 30, 18, 61]
   - Highest value: 61 (item 5)

Considering these preferences, we aim to assign items such that each agent receives the items they value most, without overlap:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 since they value it the highest (96).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 since they value it the second highest (91) and to ensure they have at least two items.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 since they value it the highest (85).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 as it is the highest value for them (61).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since it is one of the higher values (60) and to ensure they have at least one item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 to balance the distribution.

Here's the proposed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items while ensuring that all items are distributed.
