Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  65   2  86  99  59
1  52  29  74   8   3  66
2  77  33  40  18   7  29
3  11  77  57  98  72   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 33 40 18  7 29]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated. This can be approached by considering the preferences of each agent and ensuring no agent is left without items unless necessary.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 2 has moderate valuations, but nothing very high.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly and also has decent valuations for other items.

Let's allocate based on the highest values each agent has:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 81).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 77).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 74).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 98).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 99).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 66).

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it highly, while keeping the allocations fair and balanced.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with Agent 2 not receiving any items due to having lower valuations compared to others.
