Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  23  78  16  31  65
1  35  88  89   8  51  62
2  43  61  70  85  35  25
3  31  40  50  68  46  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. However, since there are four agents and only six items, some agents may have to receive no items. Let's try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (81), Item 2 (78)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (89), Item 1 (88)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (85), Item 2 (70)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (68), Item 5 (52)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3

Now, we have allocated 4 items (Item 0, Item 2, Item 3, and Item 5). To allocate the remaining items (Item 1 and Item 4), we can look at the next highest values for agents who have not yet received their optimal number of items:

5. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (value 88 for Agent 1) since it's their next highest value and they already have an item.
6. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 35 for Agent 2) since it's their next highest value and they already have an item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing the value received by each agent.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
