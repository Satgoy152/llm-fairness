Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  68  55   1  51  89
1  96  95  25  90  94  49
2   4  79  59  40  95  31
3  47  59  47  26   2   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 79 59 40 95 31]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's consider maximizing the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations first while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**  
   Highest values are for items 5 (89) and 1 (68). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**  
   Highest values are for items 0 (96) and 1 (95). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**  
   Highest value is for item 4 (95). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3's Valuations:**  
   Highest values are for items 1 (59) and 0 (47). Since item 1 has a higher value and is still available, assign item 1 to Agent 3.

5. Now, let's allocate the remaining items 2 and 3.  
   - For item 2: 
     - Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 2 at 59, and Agent 3 at 47.
     - Assign item 2 to Agent 2, who values it the highest among the remaining agents.
   
   - For item 3:
     - Agent 2 values it at 40, Agent 0 at 1, and Agent 3 at 26.
     - Assign item 3 to Agent 2, who values it the highest among the remaining agents.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 2, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

Each agent has been considered for allocation, and a total of 6 items have been distributed.
