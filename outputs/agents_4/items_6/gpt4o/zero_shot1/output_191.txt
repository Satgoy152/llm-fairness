Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  48  44  79  63  58
1  12  52  16  40  64  95
2  85  68  84  15  99   3
3  74  82  53  97  40  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that all 6 items are distributed among the 4 agents. A common approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Item 3 has the highest value (97) for agent 3.
2. Item 4 has the highest value (99) for agent 2.
3. Item 5 has the highest value (95) for agent 1.
4. Item 0 has the highest value (85) for agent 2.
5. Item 1 has the highest value (82) for agent 3.
6. Item 2 has the highest value (84) for agent 2.

Let's tally the allocations based on the above selections:

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives item 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 4, and 2.
- Agent 3 receives items 3 and 1.

Thus, the allocations can be summarized in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 2, 4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed, maximizing the total value across all agents while allocating the items fairly.
