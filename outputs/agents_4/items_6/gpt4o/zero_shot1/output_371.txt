Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  81  36   2  82  57
1  53  16  21  23  47  29
2  59  73  89  81  48  83
3  22  77  15   3  81  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we want to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents who value them the most while ensuring each agent receives an equitable number of items (as much as possible given the total number of items). There are 6 items and 4 agents, which means each agent should ideally receive at least 1 item, with 2 agents receiving 2 items.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 61.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 81.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 89.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 81.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 82, but since Agent 0 already has 2 items, we check the next highest, which is Agent 3 at 81.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 83, but since Agent 2 already has 2 items, we check the next highest, which is Agent 0 at 57. However, Agent 0 already has 2 items, so the next highest is Agent 1 at 29.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 3: Item [4]

In JSON format, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
