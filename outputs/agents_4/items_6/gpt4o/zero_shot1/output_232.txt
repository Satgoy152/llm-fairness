Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36   9  32  85  97   6
1  98  16  15  42  65  45
2  68  96  49  84  71  79
3  85  86  66  71  56   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to distribute the 6 items among the 4 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocations should reflect a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [36, 9, 32, 85, 97, 6]
- Agent 1 values: [98, 16, 15, 42, 65, 45]
- Agent 2 values: [68, 96, 49, 84, 71, 79]
- Agent 3 values: [85, 86, 66, 71, 56, 1]

A fair allocation could involve giving each agent their most highly valued items, while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable number of items. Here’s a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4 (97).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (98).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 1 (96).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3 (71).

This leaves items 2 and 5 to be allocated. We can allocate these based on the next highest preferences:

- Agent 2 can also receive item 5 (79) as it’s their next highest preference.
- Agent 3 can receive item 2 (66) as it’s their next highest preference after item 3.

Based on this reasoning, here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution reflects a balance based on their preferences.
