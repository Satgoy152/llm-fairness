Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  91  70  85   4  90
1  43  13  83  49  74  82
2  91  90  16  33  48  69
3  43  39  13  82  76  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 90 16 33 48 69]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations and attempt to allocate the items.

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (91).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (83).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (91).
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (82).

Given these preferences, we can start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, provided no conflicts arise:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (4 and 5) based on the next highest valuations:

- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 74, which is the highest compared to other agents' valuations for this item.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 90, which is the highest compared to other agents' valuations for this item.

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
