Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  23  68  12  92  63
1  39  77  96  51  19  11
2  61   3  80  16  32  71
3   9  68  18  74  15  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 23 68 12 92 63]
 [39 77 96 51 19 11]
 [61  3 80 16 32 71]
 [ 9 68 18 74 15 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

We have the following valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [76, 23, 68, 12, 92, 63]
Agent 1: [39, 77, 96, 51, 19, 11]
Agent 2: [61, 3, 80, 16, 32, 71]
Agent 3: [9, 68, 18, 74, 15, 51]
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Assign items by highest value per agent:** 
   - Start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet.

2. **Ensure all items are allocated**:
   - Continue assigning remaining items to agents in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (92).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (96).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 2 (80) but since it's already taken, assign item 5 (71).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 3 (74).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items: 

- **Items left: 0, 1**
- Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 0 (76).
- Agent 1 hasn't received any item yet, assign item 1 (77) to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent's satisfaction is reasonably considered given the constraint of distributing 6 items evenly.
