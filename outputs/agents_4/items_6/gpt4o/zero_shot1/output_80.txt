Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  17  77  37  88  96
1  42  54  35   6  22  99
2  97  17  47  41  34   3
3  86  77  75  93  38   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated. One approach is to use a greedy method where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Let's walk through the process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 34
   - Agent 1 values it at 42
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   - Agent 3 values it at 86
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 17
   - Agent 1 values it at 54
   - Agent 2 values it at 17
   - Agent 3 values it at 77
   - Allocate to Agent 3 (highest value)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 77
   - Agent 1 values it at 35
   - Agent 2 values it at 47
   - Agent 3 values it at 75
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 37
   - Agent 1 values it at 6
   - Agent 2 values it at 41
   - Agent 3 values it at 93
   - Allocate to Agent 3 (highest value)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 88
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Agent 2 values it at 34
   - Agent 3 values it at 38
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 99
   - Agent 2 values it at 3
   - Agent 3 values it at 8
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value)

The allocations based on the above reasoning are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most, leading to an efficient distribution according to the given valuations.
