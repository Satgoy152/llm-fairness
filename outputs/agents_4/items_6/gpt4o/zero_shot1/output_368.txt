Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  36  15  75  30  36
1  85  42  92  47  31   5
2  78  31   1  36  54  62
3   7  79  21  91  32  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can employ the "maximal sum" approach, where each agent receives the item(s) that provide the highest total value for them. Given that there are 6 items and 4 agents, each agent should receive at least one item, and one agent will receive two items.

Let's calculate the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [73, 36, 15, 75, 30, 36]
   - Highest value item: 3 (Value: 75)
   - Next best choice after item 3: 0 (Value: 73)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [85, 42, 92, 47, 31, 5]
   - Highest value item: 2 (Value: 92)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [78, 31, 1, 36, 54, 62]
   - Highest value item: 5 (Value: 62)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: [7, 79, 21, 91, 32, 75]
   - Highest value item: 3, but it's already taken by Agent 0, so next highest:
   - Next best choice: 1 (Value: 79)

Let's allocate accordingly, ensuring each agent has at least one item:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (Value: 75)
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (Value: 92)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (Value: 62)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (Value: 79)

Now, Agent 0 has one item, so we can give them their next best item that hasn't been allocated yet:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (Value: 73)

Items allocated thus far: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]

We have one item left (item 4), which is unallocated. Let's choose the agent that benefits most from it:

- Values for item 4: 
  - Agent 0: 30
  - Agent 1: 31
  - Agent 2: 54
  - Agent 3: 32

Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (Value: 54).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated an integer number of items, and all 6 items have been distributed.
