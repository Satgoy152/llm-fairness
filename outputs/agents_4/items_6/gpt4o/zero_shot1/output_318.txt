Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1   1  54  11  87  35
1  65  80  44  33  74  11
2  31  17  88  80  62  55
3  28  52  38  31  79  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that balances both the value each agent assigns to the items and the need to distribute items evenly. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - Each agent should ideally receive 1 or 2 items since there are 6 items and 4 agents.
   - The goal is to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

2. **Allocation Approach**:
   - Assign high-value items to agents that value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Specific Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Receives item 4 (87) as it's the highest value item for agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Receives item 1 (80) and item 0 (65) as these are the highest value items for agent 1.
   - Agent 2: Receives item 2 (88) and item 5 (55) as these are the highest value items for agent 2.
   - Agent 3: Receives item 3 (31) as it allows Agent 3 to have an item while maximizing overall valuation.

4. **Final Allocations**:
   - Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items equals 6.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
