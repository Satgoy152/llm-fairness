Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  36  71  31  85   3
1   0   9  99  80  56  58
2  46  99  79  11  19  94
3  38  89   3  45  83  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value assigned to all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. **Determine the Highest Valuation for Each Item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most. This ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the highest.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
   - Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, given the constraints.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Item 0: Highest value is 68 (Agent 0).
   - Item 1: Highest value is 99 (Agent 2).
   - Item 2: Highest value is 99 (Agent 1).
   - Item 3: Highest value is 80 (Agent 1).
   - Item 4: Highest value is 85 (Agent 0).
   - Item 5: Highest value is 94 (Agent 2).

4. **Ensure All Agents Get at Least One Item**:
   - Agent 3 has not been assigned any item yet. We can try to assign an item that will cause the least disruption to the highest value allocations. Since item 3 also has a relatively high value for Agent 3 (45), we can assign item 3 to Agent 3 instead of Agent 1, who already has item 2.

5. **Final Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 and Item 4.
   - Agent 1: Item 2.
   - Agent 2: Item 1 and Item 5.
   - Agent 3: Item 3.

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
