Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  91  66  40  62  65
1  43  87  84  99  37  39
2  72  20  46  89  77  58
3  39  75  40  60  45  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 20 46 89 77 58]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 3 has a reasonable valuation for item 5.

Let's try to allocate items with these points in mind:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Now we have items 2 and 4 left to allocate. Letâ€™s consider:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, who values it at 77.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, who values it at 84.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed with an attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

Each agent has received items, and all 6 items have been allocated.
