Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  46  51  63  31  78
1  27   2  60  67  87  88
2  95  26  67  41  37  33
3  75  75  46  61  37  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can follow a simple strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate each item based on the agent valuations and assign them accordingly:

- **Item 0**:  
  - Agent 0: 95
  - Agent 1: 27
  - Agent 2: 95
  - Agent 3: 75  
  Item 0 can be allocated to either Agent 0 or Agent 2. To make the distribution more balanced, let's assign it to Agent 0.

- **Item 1**:  
  - Agent 0: 46
  - Agent 1: 2
  - Agent 2: 26
  - Agent 3: 75  
  Item 1 should be allocated to Agent 3.

- **Item 2**:  
  - Agent 0: 51
  - Agent 1: 60
  - Agent 2: 67
  - Agent 3: 46  
  Item 2 should be allocated to Agent 2.

- **Item 3**:  
  - Agent 0: 63
  - Agent 1: 67
  - Agent 2: 41
  - Agent 3: 61  
  Item 3 should be allocated to Agent 1.

- **Item 4**:  
  - Agent 0: 31
  - Agent 1: 87
  - Agent 2: 37
  - Agent 3: 37  
  Item 4 should be allocated to Agent 1.

- **Item 5**:  
  - Agent 0: 78
  - Agent 1: 88
  - Agent 2: 33
  - Agent 3: 50  
  Item 5 should be allocated to Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated. Our assignments currently look like this:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [3, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [1]

This distribution gives each agent at least one item and uses all six items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```
