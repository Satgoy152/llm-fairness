Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  22  64  15  39  55
1  46  91  58  58  35  56
2  62  21  13  83   1  46
3  54   1  19  22  47  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54  1 19 22 47 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and considering the overall fairness of the distribution.

One approach is to use a greedy strategy where we assign items based on the highest value an agent assigns to them, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest at 91.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest at 83.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 64.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it second highest at 62.
5. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it second highest at 55.
6. Assign item 4 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it the highest at 47.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
