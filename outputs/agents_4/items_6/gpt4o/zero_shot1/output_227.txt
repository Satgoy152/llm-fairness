Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  58  54   0  71  51
1  78  67  71  24   5  13
2   4  19  94  87  41  33
3  22  82  12  70  59  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should first consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common approach is to use a "maximizing minimum envy" strategy, trying to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (71)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (78)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (94)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (93)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate 2 more items fairly among the agents.

5. **Next highest valuations**:
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (67), Item 2 (71)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (82), Item 3 (70)
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (58), Item 2 (54)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (87), Item 5 (33)

6. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3 (highest valuation left for this item).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation left for this item).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their individual high valuations for the items they received.
