Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  78  59  19  95  40
1  56  87  97  98   6  83
2  14  38  11  32  71  48
3  29  34  43  16  26  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item where possible. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values items very differently, with a high value on item 0 and item 4. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 places a very high value on items 2 and 3, with item 3 being the highest. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 the most. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 doesn't have particularly high valuations, but item 5 is slightly valued. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 0. Let's also give item 1 to Agent 0 since it's the highest remaining value for them.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 3. Let's also give item 2 to Agent 1 since it's the highest remaining value for them.

Thus, the allocation of items to agents is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
