Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  38  82  26  24  74
1  48  36  38  12  57   3
2  83   8  37  75  69  71
3  26  95  30  62  47  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. A potential approach is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 2 (82).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 0 (48).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 0 (83), but it is already allocated.
   - Next highest valuation for item 3 (75).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 1 (95).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Now we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (4 and 5):

5. **Remaining items**:
   - Item 4: 
     - Highest remaining valuation is Agent 2 (69).
     - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   
   - Item 5: 
     - Highest remaining valuation is Agent 2 (71).
     - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and the total valuation is reasonably balanced among the agents.
