Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  35   5  37  40  23
1  40  97  99   6   9  17
2  54  41  43   5  61   2
3  13  14  45  54  58  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value and ensures each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations. Since there are 4 agents and 6 items, not every agent will receive the same number of items, but we should strive to allocate them in a balanced manner.

Let's go through a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by looking at the highest valuations for each item and allocate them to the corresponding agents.
2. Ensure that no agent receives disproportionate allocations by considering the distribution of remaining items.

After analyzing the table, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly (40), which is also relatively high compared to others' valuations of item 4.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (99), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (54), so assign item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (81), so assign item 5 to agent 3.
- Allocate the remaining items (1 and 3), considering remaining high valuations and balance.

With this strategy, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 3 receives item 5.

This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations while distributing the items fairly. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [5]
}
```
