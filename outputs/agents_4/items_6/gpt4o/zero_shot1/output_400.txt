Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  98  57   9  27  52
1  60  45  42  49  25  39
2  48   7  42  61  43  66
3  25  24  58  24  26  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on the given valuations. One way to approach this is to assign items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 1 has the highest value (98) for Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0 has the highest value (60) for Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 5 has the highest value (66) for Agent 2.
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 2 has the highest value (58) for Agent 3.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.

5. **Remaining Items:** 3 and 4.

- **Item 3** is valued highest by Agent 2 (61). Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.
- **Item 4** is valued highest by Agent 2 (43). Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```
