Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  15  62  48  62  72
1  16  41   3  80  75   7
2  49  86  19  82  85  27
3  90  57  11   0  48  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can aim to maximize total satisfaction by assigning items to the agent who values them the most. However, since there are 6 items and 4 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's evaluate the highest value each agent assigns to each item and allocate accordingly:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 16
   - Agent 2 values it at 49
   - Agent 3 values it at 90 (highest value)

   Allocate item 0 to agent 3.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 15
   - Agent 1 values it at 41 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 86
   - Agent 3 values it at 57

   Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 62 (highest value)
   - Agent 1 values it at 3
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - Agent 3 values it at 11

   Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 48
   - Agent 1 values it at 80 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 82
   - Agent 3 values it at 0

   Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 62
   - Agent 1 values it at 75 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 85
   - Agent 3 values it at 48

   Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 72 (highest value)
   - Agent 1 values it at 7
   - Agent 2 values it at 27
   - Agent 3 values it at 12

   Allocate item 5 to agent 0.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives no items.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 0.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 3, 4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
