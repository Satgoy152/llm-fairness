Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  70  49  42   6  69
1  31  22  40  48  83  79
2  84  79  33  78  42  57
3  71  68  59  15  55  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We will allocate the items based on the highest individual valuations first, taking care to distribute the items as evenly as possible among the agents.

Let's go through the valuation matrix to make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 70.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 4 with a value of 83.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 0 with a value of 84.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 0 with a value of 71, but item 0 is already taken. The next highest is item 2 with a value of 59.

Now, we have allocated 4 items and need to allocate 2 more items:

5. **Available items**: Items 3 and 5 are still available.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 at 78, which is the highest remaining valuation for item 3, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 at 69, which is the highest remaining valuation for item 5, so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

Now, all 6 items are allocated, with each agent getting at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 3: Item 2

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```
