Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  81  54  46  95  15
1  90  76  82  15  12  99
2   1  22  47  95  48  33
3  20  55  93  50  90  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 76 82 15 12 99]
 [ 1 22 47 95 48 33]
 [20 55 93 50 90 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, as the number of agents equals the number of items in this case. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning items based on the highest individual valuations for each agent.
2. Attempt to maximize the total value by making sure each agent gets at least one item, and the allocations are fair.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (99), so we assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (99), so we assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (95), so we assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (93), so we assign item 2 to agent 3.

Now every agent has one item. Letâ€™s allocate the remaining items 1 and 4:

- Item 1: Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (81), so we assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (90), so we assign item 4 to agent 3.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.
