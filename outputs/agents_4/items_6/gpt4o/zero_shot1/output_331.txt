Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  47  37  33  32  87
1  97  41  64  43  92  53
2  56  81  23  32  18  55
3  38  61  56   5  97  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Determine the Total Valuation for Each Item Across All Agents:** This helps identify the items that are highly valued across the board.
2. **Assign Items Based on the Highest Valuation for Each Agent:** Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and distribute additional items based on remaining valuations.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 0 (95).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0 (97). Since item 0 is taken, next highest is item 4 (92).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 1 (81).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 4 (97). Since item 4 is taken, next highest is item 5 (85).

Now we have:
- Agent 0 with item 0.
- Agent 1 with item 4.
- Agent 2 with item 1.
- Agent 3 with item 5.

We have 2 items left (items 2 and 3).

- **Agent 1**: Next highest available is item 2 (64).
- **Agent 3**: Next highest available is item 3 (5).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [4, 2]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [5, 3]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```
