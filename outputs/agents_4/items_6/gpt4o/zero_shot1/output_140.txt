Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  26  87  69  22  59
1  86  88  73  38  38  28
2  88  65  18  94  95  24
3  91  74  97  17  27  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 4 agents and 6 items, a reasonable approach is to allocate at least one item to each agent, given that the total number of items is greater than the number of agents.

Let's start by evaluating the highest-valued items for each agent and attempt to distribute them fairly:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: Item 2 (87), Item 3 (69)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: Item 1 (88), Item 0 (86)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: Item 4 (95), Item 3 (94)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: Item 2 (97), Item 0 (91)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and there are 2 items left (Items 3 and 5). We need to distribute these among the agents, considering their remaining valuations.

- **Remaining items: 3, 5**
  - For Item 3:
    - Agent 2 has the highest valuation (94).
    - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.
  - For Item 5:
    - Agent 3 has the highest valuation (71).
    - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3.

After this allocation, each agent has received at least one item, and all items have been allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
