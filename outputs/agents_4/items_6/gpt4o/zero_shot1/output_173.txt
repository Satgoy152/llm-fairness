Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  37  61  48  95  30
1  12  45  24  16  79  89
2   4  40  96  96  62  53
3  68   3  53  70  20  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is balanced. We have 6 items and 4 agents, which means some agents will receive more items than others. One heuristic approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Begin by allocating the highest value items to each agent based on their individual preferences.
2. Balance the allocation by ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 4 (95) and Item 0 (69).
- Agent 1 receives Item 5 (89).
- Agent 2 receives Item 2 (96) and Item 3 (96).
- Agent 3 receives Item 1 (3).

This allocation is based on maximizing the value each agent receives:

- Agent 0's total value: 95 + 69 = 164
- Agent 1's total value: 89
- Agent 2's total value: 96 + 96 = 192
- Agent 3's total value: 3

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
