Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  73  76  20  55  82
1  63  65  40  66  54  46
2   2  27  89  68  95  21
3  83  67  76  16  20  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 27 89 68 95 21]
 [83 67 76 16 20 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the valuations and the constraint of 6 items, we can use a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (82), followed by item 2 (76).
   - Assign items 5 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (66).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (95).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (83), followed by item 1 (67).
   - Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item with high valuation according to their preferences, and all 6 items are allocated.
