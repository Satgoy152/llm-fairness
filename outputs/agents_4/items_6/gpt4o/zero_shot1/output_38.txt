Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  21  49  78  14   9
1  45  34  30   4  31  38
2  11  48   6  74  15  60
3  45  11  25  42   3  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, I'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values are highest for items 3 (78), 0 (52), and 2 (49). Since the goal is to distribute fairly, let's assign the highest value item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 1 the highest (34). Let's assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the highest (60). Let's assign item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the highest, but since item 5 is already assigned, the next highest is item 0 (45). Let's assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we have assigned 4 items, and 2 items are left to be assigned. Let's consider the remaining items:

- Item 2: Assign to Agent 0, who values it second highest (49).
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 1, who values it third highest (31).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation takes into account the goal of maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring fair distribution of the items.
