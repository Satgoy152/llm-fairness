Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  85  30  94  20  57
1  93  63  21  54  79  66
2  38  12  85  86  15  27
3  10  14  27  96  80  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 63 21 54 79 66]
 [38 12 85 86 15 27]
 [10 14 27 96 80 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize overall satisfaction. A common approach is to use a method similar to the "maximin" strategy, where we try to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents.

Let's analyze the given valuations table:

```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5
-----------|------------------------
    0      |  1  85  30  94  20  57
    1      | 93  63  21  54  79  66
    2      | 38  12  85  86  15  27
    3      | 10  14  27  96  80  95
```

Let's begin the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (value 94), so we assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (value 93), so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (value 85), so we assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (value 95), so we assign item 5 to agent 3.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items 1 and 4:

5. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 85
   - Agent 1 values it at 63
   - Agent 2 values it at 12
   - Agent 3 values it at 14
   Since Agent 0 values it the most, assign item 1 to agent 0.

6. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 20
   - Agent 1 values it at 79
   - Agent 2 values it at 15
   - Agent 3 values it at 80
   Since Agent 3 values it the most, assign item 4 to agent 3.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items.
