Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  87  68  20  63   6
1  41  43   8  47  14  27
2  59   8  74  75  33  96
3  54  23  24  63  64  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple algorithm to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6. We'll aim for a distribution that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the agents' valuations.

Let's consider each agent's highest-valued items and allocate accordingly, ensuring each agent gets at least one item to start with:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 (87) and 2 (68).
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (47).
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most (96).
4. **Agent 3** has relatively high valuations for items 4 (64) and 3 (63).

We will start by assigning each agent one of their highest-valued items:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 2) to the agents to make sure all 6 items are allocated.

Considering the remaining items:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (59).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (74).

By assigning both items 0 and 2 to Agent 2, we maximize the overall valuation.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 6 items are distributed.
