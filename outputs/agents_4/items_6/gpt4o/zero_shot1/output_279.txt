Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  89  27   6  80  41
1  99  13  64   8   9  39
2   9  11  43  71  39  81
3  42  82  23   7  91  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86 89 27  6 80 41]
 [99 13 64  8  9 39]
 [ 9 11 43 71 39 81]
 [42 82 23  7 91 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation of items for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given the constraints and the agents' valuations, here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 1:** Has the highest valuation for item 0, but since we're giving that to agent 0, we'll focus on item 2.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 5 highly.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 4 highly.

Here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0 and 1
- **Agent 1:** Item 2
- **Agent 2:** Item 5
- **Agent 3:** Item 4

We have now allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the 6th item, which is item 3, with a valuation preference for agent 2.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
