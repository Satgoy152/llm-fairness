Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  17  60  18  81   6
1  76  55  18   7  16   6
2  10  89  94  79  67  34
3   5   1  21  94  58  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items they value highly while attempting to balance the total value each agent receives. Given there are 4 agents and 6 items, some agents will receive more items than others, but we will try to distribute them as fairly as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (90), so item 0 should be allocated to agent 0.
   - Agent 0 also values item 4 highly (81), so item 4 should be allocated to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 0, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 1 (55), so item 1 should be allocated to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (94), so item 2 should be allocated to agent 2.
   - The next highest valuation for agent 2 is item 3 (79), so item 3 should be allocated to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Agent 3's highest valuation is for item 3, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 4, but it's also allocated. The next is item 5 (20), so item 5 should be allocated to agent 3.

Now, let's put these allocations into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5]
}
```
