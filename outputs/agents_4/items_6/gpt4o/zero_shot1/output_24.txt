Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  64  60  92  60  38
1  23  94  88   8   4  43
2  67   6  65  48  86  93
3  13  61  91   8  53  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  64  60  92  60  38
1  23  94  88   8   4  43
2  67   6  65  48  86  93
3  13  61  91   8  53  97
```

We will try to assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with a fair share of items.

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values this the most (67).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values this the most (94).
3. Item 2: Agent 3 values this the most (91).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values this the most (92).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values this the most (86).
6. Item 5: Agent 3 values this the most (97).

Let's ensure each agent gets a fair share of items. If there's an imbalance, we can adjust based on the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 initially gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 3 initially gets items 2 and 5.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: 1 item
- Agent 1: 1 item
- Agent 2: 2 items
- Agent 3: 2 items

This distribution ensures fairness, as each agent has either 1 or 2 items. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
