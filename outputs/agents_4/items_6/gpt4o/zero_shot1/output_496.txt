Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  25  65  18  99  88
1  96  74  62  14  46  80
2  69  94   7  31  95  52
3  53  50   9  51  29  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuations:** Start by identifying the highest valued items for each agent to ensure that each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items.

2. **Sort Values:** For each agent, sort the items by their value in descending order.

3. **Allocate Items:** Assign items to agents starting from the agent with the highest individual item value to ensure fairness and satisfaction. Make sure no item is allocated more than once.

4. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:** Ensure that all items are assigned without exceeding the total of 6 items.

Following this approach, here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4 (value 99), so assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0 (value 96), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 1 (value 94), so assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has a relatively high value for item 3 (value 51), so assign item 3 to agent 3.
- The remaining items 2 and 5 can be assigned to agents based on remaining high values:
  - Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 80).
  - Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 65).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes total satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated.
