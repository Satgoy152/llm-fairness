Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  60  94   3  94  94
1  56  77  74  72  84  79
2  48  61  75  29  23  42
3  29  64  29  92  12  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 77 74 72 84 79]
 [48 61 75 29 23 42]
 [29 64 29 92 12 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items in descending order: [2 (94), 4 (94), 5 (94), 0 (74), 1 (60), 3 (3)]
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items in descending order: [4 (84), 5 (79), 1 (77), 2 (74), 0 (56), 3 (72)]
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value among remaining).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items in descending order: [2 (75), 1 (61), 5 (42), 0 (48), 3 (29), 4 (23)]
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value among remaining).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items in descending order: [3 (92), 5 (78), 1 (64), 0 (29), 2 (29), 4 (12)]
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (highest value).

Now, we have allocated 4 items (2, 4, 1, 3). We need to allocate 2 more items, ensuring each agent gets one:

5. **Agent 0**: 
   - Remaining highest value items: [5 (94), 0 (74)]
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**: 
   - Remaining highest value item: [0 (56)]
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
