Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  98  60  42  42  63
1  90   9  73  56  46  63
2  47  33   1  66  12  52
3  76  31  80  95  76  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79 98 60 42 42 63]
 [90  9 73 56 46 63]
 [47 33  1 66 12 52]
 [76 31 80 95 76 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Weâ€™ll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Valuations: [79, 98, 60, 42, 42, 63]
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 and 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Valuations: [90, 9, 73, 56, 46, 63]
   - Highest valuations are for items 0 and 2, but item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we consider item 2.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Valuations: [47, 33, 1, 66, 12, 52]
   - Highest valuations are for items 3 and 5.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Valuations: [76, 31, 80, 95, 76, 44]
   - Highest valuations are for items 3, 2, and 4, but items 3 and 2 are already allocated, so we consider item 4.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [1, 0]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 3: Item [4]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and that the items are distributed to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. 

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
