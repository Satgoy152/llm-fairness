Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  38  44  47  96   5
1  95  54   9  45  25  30
2  60  87  58  38   2  89
3  60   2  80  90   6  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 38 44 47 96  5]
 [95 54  9 45 25 30]
 [60 87 58 38  2 89]
 [60  2 80 90  6 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total value that each agent receives based on their valuations. Let's look at a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for items 0 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0, but since it's already taken, we consider their next highest valuations.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 3.

We will try to allocate items such that the total value is maximized for each agent. Here's a possible allocation:

- Give item 0 to Agent 0 (value 93).
- Give item 4 to Agent 0 (value 96).
- Give item 1 to Agent 2 (value 87).
- Give item 5 to Agent 2 (value 89).
- Give item 2 to Agent 3 (value 80).
- Give item 3 to Agent 3 (value 90).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that maximizes their individual total valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
