Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  39  49  44  63  55
1  35  73  17  31  23  53
2  18  29  89  23  36  94
3   6  96  46   6  58  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 39 49 44 63 55]
 [35 73 17 31 23 53]
 [18 29 89 23 36 94]
 [ 6 96 46  6 58 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, as there are four agents and six items. Let's analyze and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [42, 39, 49, 44, 63, 55]
   - Highest value: item 4 (value 63)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [35, 73, 17, 31, 23, 53]
   - Highest value: item 1 (value 73)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [18, 29, 89, 23, 36, 94]
   - Highest value: item 5 (value 94)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [6, 96, 46, 6, 58, 56]
   - Highest value: item 1 (value 96), but item 1 is better for Agent 1, so consider the next highest: item 4 (value 58)

Now, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and distributing the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 0

Two items remain: 2 and 3. Let's allocate them based on maximizing agent valuations:

- **Agent 0** could benefit from item 2 (value 49)
- **Agent 2** could benefit from item 3 (value 23)

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```
