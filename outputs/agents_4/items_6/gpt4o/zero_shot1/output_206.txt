Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  26   6  42  75  56
1  77  51  84  53  71  82
2  49  81  58  32  14  13
3  44  24  63  61  63  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. We'll aim for a balance in the distribution by prioritizing higher valuations and ensuring every agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the data:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 has a very high valuation for item 2 and also values items 5 and 0.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5.

A possible fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 4, as they are the highest among their preferences.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, where their valuation is the highest among all agents.
- Agent 2 receives item 1, their highest valued item.
- Agent 3 receives items 3 and 5, as item 5 is their highest valued item and item 3 ensures they receive more than one item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and only 6 items are distributed.
