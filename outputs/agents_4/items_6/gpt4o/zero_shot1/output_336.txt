Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  89  82  11  68  72
1  88  51  50  82  30  64
2  91  67  32  28  97   5
3  36  98  85  55  75   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0: [68, 89, 82, 11, 68, 72]
- Agent 1: [88, 51, 50, 82, 30, 64]
- Agent 2: [91, 67, 32, 28, 97, 5]
- Agent 3: [36, 98, 85, 55, 75, 8]

Considering the goal of maximizing total valuations, let's attempt to allocate items in a way that optimizes the overall happiness:

1. Start by assigning items with the highest individual valuation that does not conflict with other high-value items across different agents.

2. Allocate items step-by-step:

   - Item 4 has highest value 97 for Agent 2.
   - Item 1 has highest value 98 for Agent 3.
   - Item 0 has highest value 91 for Agent 2.
   - Item 2 has value 85 for Agent 3.
   - Item 3 has value 82 for Agent 1.
   - Item 5 has value 72 for Agent 0.

3. Check that all items are allocated and each agent has a fair allocation:

   - Agent 0: [5]
   - Agent 1: [3]
   - Agent 2: [0, 4]
   - Agent 3: [1, 2]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that are relatively high in value according to their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
