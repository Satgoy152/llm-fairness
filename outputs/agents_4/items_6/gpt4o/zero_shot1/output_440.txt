Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  91   2   3  98  18
1   5  26   3  72  75  83
2  92  11  11  68  83  79
3  26  19  15  42  32  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 26  3 72 75 83]
 [92 11 11 68 83 79]
 [26 19 15 42 32 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **List Valuations**: Review the valuation table for each agent regarding the items.

2. **Assign Items**: Allocate items to agents such that the total valuation is maximized and each agent gets an integer number of items.

3. **Check Fairness**: All items must be allocated, and no agent should have an unequal advantage unless necessary to allocate all items.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value for items 4 (98) and 1 (91).
- **Agent 1**: High value for item 5 (83).
- **Agent 2**: High value for item 0 (92).
- **Agent 3**: Moderate values, can take items that are less valued by others.

Based on this, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: items 4 and 1
- Agent 1: item 5
- Agent 2: item 0
- Agent 3: items 2 and 3

This allocation ensures each agent gets a reasonable share considering their valuation, and all 6 items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This assignment maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
