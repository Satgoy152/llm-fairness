Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91   0  89  33  42  75
1  59  22  71  29  62  55
2  26  34  22  69  39  86
3  44  34  97  24  59  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 34 22 69 39 86]
 [44 34 97 24 59 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences. The goal is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest with 91. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest with 71. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest with 86. Assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest, but itâ€™s already taken. The next highest is item 3 with 24. Assign item 3 to agent 3.

Now, we have 2 more items (1 and 4) to allocate:

- Item 1 is valued at 34 by both agents 2 and 3. To balance allocations, assign item 1 to agent 2 as they currently have only one item.
- Item 4 is valued the highest by agent 1 with 62. Assign item 4 to agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to only one agent, and it attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuation of the items.
