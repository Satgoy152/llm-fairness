Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  13  51  84  17  71
1  96  77  26  58   0  51
2  52  46  84  26   3  73
3  58  33  67  61  16  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value of the items, considering their individual valuations. We can aim for a distribution where the total value perceived by each agent is balanced.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to assign items such that the total perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's examine the total values each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(6 + 13 + 51 + 84 + 17 + 71 = 242\)
- Agent 1: \(96 + 77 + 26 + 58 + 0 + 51 = 308\)
- Agent 2: \(52 + 46 + 84 + 26 + 3 + 73 = 284\)
- Agent 3: \(58 + 33 + 67 + 61 + 16 + 59 = 294\)

Now, let's allocate items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 highly (84), assign it to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 highly (96), assign it to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly (84), assign it to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly as well, but item 5 is also valued (59), assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, allocate remaining items considering remaining values:

5. Assign item 1 to Agent 1. (77)
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 0. (17)

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the perceived total value across agents while ensuring each agent gets at least some items, considering their valuations.
