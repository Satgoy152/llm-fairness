Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  10  48  41   6  46
1  62  95  26  77  54  81
2  70  73  67  55  12  57
3  76  80  92  50  77  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item when possible. Here is one way to do this:

1. **Calculate Total Values for Each Agent Across All Items:**

   - Agent 0: 50, 10, 48, 41, 6, 46 => Total: 201
   - Agent 1: 62, 95, 26, 77, 54, 81 => Total: 395
   - Agent 2: 70, 73, 67, 55, 12, 57 => Total: 334
   - Agent 3: 76, 80, 92, 50, 77, 76 => Total: 451

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Individual Valuation:**

   - Item 0: Highest value by Agent 3 (76)
   - Item 1: Highest value by Agent 1 (95)
   - Item 2: Highest value by Agent 3 (92)
   - Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (77)
   - Item 4: Highest value by Agent 3 (77)
   - Item 5: Highest value by Agent 1 (81)

3. **Ensure Fair Distribution:**

   Since Agent 3 and Agent 1 received all items in the above allocation, we need to distribute some items to Agent 0 and Agent 2 for fairness.

4. **Reallocate Items to Ensure Fairness:**

   Let's try to reallocate some items to ensure a more even distribution:

   - Agent 0: Item 0 (value 50)
   - Agent 1: Items 1 (value 95) and 3 (value 77)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (value 57)
   - Agent 3: Items 2 (value 92) and 4 (value 77)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and seeks to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
