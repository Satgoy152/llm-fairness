Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  24  91  90  74  80
1  66  11  38  99   5  79
2  14  70  59  15  70  70
3  27  24  46  97  68  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. One approach is to use a round-robin distribution based on each agent's highest valued items or to use a method like the max-min fairness approach.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by looking at the highest value each agent has for any item and allocate that item to them if it hasn't been taken by another agent with a higher valuation.

2. Continue allocating the remaining items to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (91), so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (99), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values items 1 and 4 equally (70), so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (97), but it's already taken. Next, they value items 4 and 5 equally (68), so allocate item 4 to agent 3.
- For the remaining items (0, 5), agent 0 values item 0 the most (74), and item 5 is the highest remaining for agent 1 (79).

With this allocation, each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
