Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  26  55  36  57  50
1  51  50  23  68  16  52
2  23  84  85  32  56  82
3  50  47  18  33  65  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction, ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable number of items. We have four agents (0, 1, 2, and 3) and six items (0 to 5) to distribute.

One possible approach is to allocate the items based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Let's distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (64) and 4 (57).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (68).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (85) and 1 (84).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (75).

Considering these preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, the allocations can be as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This distribution respects the constraints and aims to satisfy the agents based on their preferences.
