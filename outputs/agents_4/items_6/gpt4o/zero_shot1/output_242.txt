Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  71  77  82  13  56
1  54  79  24  86  76  89
2   0  87  58  80  40   1
3  89  93  19  19   1  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can follow an approach where each agent receives items such that the overall valuation is maximized while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign the highest valued items**: Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item goes to the agent who places the highest value on it.

2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item**: If any agent doesn't receive an item in the first step, reallocate items to ensure every agent gets at least one item.

Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

- **Item 0**: Highest value by agent 3 (value 89)
- **Item 1**: Highest value by agent 3 (value 93)
- **Item 2**: Highest value by agent 0 (value 77)
- **Item 3**: Highest value by agent 1 (value 86)
- **Item 4**: Highest value by agent 1 (value 76)
- **Item 5**: Highest value by agent 1 (value 89)

With these initial allocations, agents 2 doesn't have an item. We can reallocate to ensure fairness:

Let's adjust to make sure each agent has at least one item:

- **Agent 3**: Gets item 0
- **Agent 0**: Gets item 2
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 3 and item 5
- **Agent 2**: Can take item 1 (value 87) 
- **Agent 1**: Moves item 4 to agent 3 to ensure agent 3 gets an item

After these adjustments, the allocations would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6.
