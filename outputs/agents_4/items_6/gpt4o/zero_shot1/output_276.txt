Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  93  99  14  34  43
1  88  14  66  86  24  77
2  25  24  12  15  24  49
3  55  94  37  96   9  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Each Agent's Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0: Highest valuations are for item 2 (99), item 1 (93), and item 0 (69).
   - Agent 1: Highest valuations are for item 0 (88), item 3 (86), and item 5 (77).
   - Agent 2: Highest valuations are for item 5 (49), item 0 (25), and item 1 (24).
   - Agent 3: Highest valuations are for item 3 (96), item 1 (94), and item 0 (55).

2. **Allocate Items to Agents:**
   - Start by assigning each agent their highest valued item.
   - Then, allocate remaining items to balance the total valuation fairly among the agents.

3. **Make the Allocations:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 2 (99).
   - Agent 1 gets item 0 (88).
   - Agent 2 gets item 5 (49).
   - Agent 3 gets item 3 (96).
   - Assign remaining items 1 and 4 to balance out remaining valuations:
     - Agent 0 gets item 1 (93).
     - Agent 1 gets item 4 (24).

4. **Review Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 1
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 4
   - Agent 2: Item 5
   - Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution of items aims to maximize the total valuations for each agent.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
