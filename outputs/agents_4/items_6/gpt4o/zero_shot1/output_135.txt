Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  73  56  15  85  22
1  37  96  49  33  82  69
2  76  52  43  53  15  65
3  19  30  13  77  55  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items (in this case, each agent can receive between 0 and 3 items since there are 4 agents and 6 items).

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a method similar to the "maximizing total utility" approach. This involves assigning items to agents in such a way that the sum of the values assigned to each agent is maximized.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item across all agents**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 96.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 96.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 56.
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values it at 77.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 85.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 65.

2. **Assign items to agents based on highest valuation**:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.

After these assignments, each item is allocated based on the highest valuation by any agent, ensuring that the total value is maximized.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents based on their highest preferences, and each agent's allocation is an integer number of items.
