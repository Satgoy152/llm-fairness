Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  10  49  51  29   6
1  12  48  35  98  28  13
2  21  95  14  87  96  73
3  18  61  54  56  30  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 10 49 51 29  6]
 [12 48 35 98 28 13]
 [21 95 14 87 96 73]
 [18 61 54 56 30 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider a strategy where we maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Since we have 4 agents and 6 items, we can give 2 agents 2 items each and the other 2 agents 1 item each. Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (95)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 3 (51)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (98)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 1 (48)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (96)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 1 (95)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (83)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 1 (61)

Based on this, we can assign the items as follows to maximize fairness:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (95)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (98)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (96)
- Agent 3: Item 5 (83)

Now, we need to assign the remaining 2 items (1 and 2) such that each agent gets an integer number of items.

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (since it is their second highest value)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 3 (since it is not yet assigned and gives Agent 3 a second item)

Final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [5, 2]
}
```
