Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59   9  44  33  20  89
1  15  49  69   6  92  99
2  50  86  51  92   9  72
3  29  23  83  61  42  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the satisfaction for all agents. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, provided no agent receives more than one item before others have received one.

Let's analyze the table and allocate items:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59
   - Agent 1 values it at 15
   - Agent 2 values it at 50
   - Agent 3 values it at 29
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 59)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Agent 2 values it at 86
   - Agent 3 values it at 23
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 86)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 44
   - Agent 1 values it at 69
   - Agent 2 values it at 51
   - Agent 3 values it at 83
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (highest value: 83)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 33
   - Agent 1 values it at 6
   - Agent 2 values it at 92
   - Agent 3 values it at 61
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 92)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 20
   - Agent 1 values it at 92
   - Agent 2 values it at 9
   - Agent 3 values it at 42
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 92)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89
   - Agent 1 values it at 99
   - Agent 2 values it at 72
   - Agent 3 values it at 96
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 99)

After allocating each item to the agent who values it the most, we have the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has an integer number of items and that all 6 items are allocated.
