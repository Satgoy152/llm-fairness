Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53   6  56  94  20  74
1  92  16  48  91  70  19
2   7  87  14  43  78  44
3  71  17   0  59   6  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction by assigning items they value the most while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a step-by-step allocation considering the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are items 3 (94) and 5 (74). We will allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value items for Agent 1 are items 0 (92) and 3 (91). Since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, we assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value items for Agent 2 are items 4 (78) and 1 (87). We can allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value items for Agent 3 are items 0 (71) and 5 (65). Since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 1, we assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, let's review the allocations to ensure every agent receives at least one item and all items are assigned:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 5
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 4

Finally, let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
