Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42   4  77  87   5   1
1  98  66  23  77  56  46
2  80  41  75  10  23  17
3  97  55  74  47  18  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as each agent receives approximately the same number of items (considering the total number of items is 6 and there are 4 agents, each agent should get about 1 or 2 items).

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 42
   - Agent 1 values it at 98
   - Agent 2 values it at 80
   - Agent 3 values it at 97
   - Best assignment: Agent 1 (value = 98)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 4
   - Agent 1 values it at 66
   - Agent 2 values it at 41
   - Agent 3 values it at 55
   - Best assignment: Agent 1 (value = 66)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 77
   - Agent 1 values it at 23
   - Agent 2 values it at 75
   - Agent 3 values it at 74
   - Best assignment: Agent 0 (value = 77)

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 87
   - Agent 1 values it at 77
   - Agent 2 values it at 10
   - Agent 3 values it at 47
   - Best assignment: Agent 0 (value = 87)

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 5
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Agent 2 values it at 23
   - Agent 3 values it at 18
   - Best assignment: Agent 1 (value = 56)

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 1
   - Agent 1 values it at 46
   - Agent 2 values it at 17
   - Agent 3 values it at 31
   - Best assignment: Agent 1 (value = 46)

Given these values, it is clear that Agent 1 values more items the most. To balance the allocation, we can adjust by giving some items to agents who have fewer items but still have relatively high values for them.

Let's adjust the allocation based on maximizing the value and fairly distributing the items:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and tries to maximize the value each agent receives:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items while trying to maximize their total valuation.
