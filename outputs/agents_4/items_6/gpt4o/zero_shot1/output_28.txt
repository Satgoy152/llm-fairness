Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  77  69  49  24  23
1  89  17  42   4  11  47
2   3  70   4  69  86  35
3  31  11  76  48  30  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest value to the agents.

Let's consider each agent's highest-valued items and allocate accordingly:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (84), Item 1 (77)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (89), Item 2 (42)
   - Item 0 is already allocated, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (86), Item 3 (69)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (76), Item 5 (52)
   - Item 2 is already allocated, so allocate Item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 1, 3
- Highest unallocated value for Item 1 is Agent 2 (70).
- Highest unallocated value for Item 3 is Agent 2 (69).

Allocate Item 1 and Item 3 to Agent 2.

Thus, the fair allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
