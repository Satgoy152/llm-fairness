Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  31  72  73  61  96
1  87  80  78  38  66  48
2  75  72  57  94  85   8
3  24  76  33  83  85  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:** We can calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to get an idea of their preferences.

2. **Allocate the Highest Valued Items:** For each agent, we can initially assign them their highest valued item(s) that hasn't been assigned yet.

3. **Balance the Allocation:** Ensure each agent ends up with a reasonable number of items, aiming to balance the total value each agent gets.

Let's proceed with these steps:

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [67, 31, 72, 73, 61, 96]
- Agent 1: [87, 80, 78, 38, 66, 48]
- Agent 2: [75, 72, 57, 94, 85, 8]
- Agent 3: [24, 76, 33, 83, 85, 49]

### Item Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 5 (96) and 3 (73).
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 0 (87) and 1 (80).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 3 (94) and 4 (85).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 4 (85) and 1 (76).

### Allocation Proposal:
1. **Agent 0** can take item 5.
2. **Agent 1** can take item 0.
3. **Agent 2** can take item 3.
4. **Agent 3** can take item 4.

Now we have allocated 4 items, leaving 2 items to be allocated (items 1 and 2).

5. **Remaining Items**: Items 1 and 2 need to be allocated.
   - **Item 1**: Best suited for Agent 1 (80).
   - **Item 2**: Best suited for Agent 0 (72).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [5, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [4]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value.

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on the agents' valuations.
