Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  74  71  74  75  17
1  99  39  26  14   9  26
2  67  26  80   0  53   4
3  93  85   5  87  77  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 39 26 14  9 26]
 [67 26 80  0 53  4]
 [93 85  5 87 77 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 6 items are allocated.

Here's one approach to achieving this:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Item 4 has a high value (75), which is one of the highest for this agent. 
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 1 (99).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 2 (80).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 3 has a high value for Agent 3 (87).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have 2 items left (1 and 5) which need to be allocated.

5. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 1 has a high valuation from Agent 3 (85), and will be assigned to Agent 3.
   - Item 5 has a relatively high valuation from Agent 3 (82), and will also be assigned to Agent 3.

This allocation maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
