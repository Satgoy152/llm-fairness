Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  51  69  94   3  12
1  63  30  18  25  61  80
2  13  10  47  46  55  87
3  64  55  77  57  71  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation that tries to balance the total valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** This agent has high valuations for items 3 and 2, so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** This agent has high valuations for items 0 and 5, so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** This agent has a high valuation for item 5, but since it's already allocated, allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** This agent has high valuations for items 0 and 2, so allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 3.

Now, item 1 is left. Allocating it to Agent 0 gives a balanced spread of items considering their valuations.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets items based on their valuations.
