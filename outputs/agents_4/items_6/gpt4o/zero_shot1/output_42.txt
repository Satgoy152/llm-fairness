Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  39  24  48  30  16
1  42  37  78  48  98  55
2  38  84  26  15  91  21
3  75  66  80  30  27  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 37 78 48 98 55]
 [38 84 26 15 91 21]
 [75 66 80 30 27 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them such that the overall allocation is balanced and considers these values. Here's one possible allocation strategy, aiming to maximize the total valuation for each agent:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Values: [13, 39, 24, 48, 30, 16]
   - Highest value item: 3 (value 48)

2. Agent 1:
   - Values: [42, 37, 78, 48, 98, 55]
   - Highest value item: 4 (value 98)

3. Agent 2:
   - Values: [38, 84, 26, 15, 91, 21]
   - Highest value item: 1 (value 84)

4. Agent 3:
   - Values: [75, 66, 80, 30, 27, 45]
   - Highest value item: 2 (value 80)

Now, we need to assign items to each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no more than the total number of items available (6 in this case). We can also attempt to distribute the lower-valued items to balance the allocation.

Potential allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [3] (value 48)
- Agent 1: Items [4] (value 98)
- Agent 2: Items [1] (value 84)
- Agent 3: Items [2, 0, 5] (values 80, 75, 45)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the total number of items is 6.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 0, 5]
}
```
