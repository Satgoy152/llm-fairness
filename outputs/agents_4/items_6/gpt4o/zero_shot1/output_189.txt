Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  97  51   1  55  47
1  50   9  62  69  64   6
2  81   6  46  48  28  10
3  37  77  23  72  59   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 97 51  1 55 47]
 [50  9 62 69 64  6]
 [81  6 46 48 28 10]
 [37 77 23 72 59  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation maximizes the total value for all agents.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Item 1 (value: 97)  
   - Item 5 (value: 47)

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Item 3 (value: 69)

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Item 0 (value: 81)  
   - Item 2 (value: 46)

4. **Agent 3:**  
   - Item 4 (value: 59)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item while trying to maximize the total valuation based on the given table.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
