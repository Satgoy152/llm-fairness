Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  80   4  42  86  40
1  40  23  55  95  80  35
2  56   7  55  55  76   2
3  33  29  58  45   1  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56  7 55 55 76  2]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. First, identify the highest value each agent has for any item to ensure fairness and satisfaction.
2. Allocate those items to the respective agents.
3. Allocate the remaining items to balance the allocation.

Based on the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 86.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 95.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the second highest at 76.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 67.

Considering the above, we need to adjust for conflicts and ensure all items are allocated:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 as it's their highest value.
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 as it's their highest value.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 as it's their second-highest value.
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 as it's their highest value.
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 as it provides a good value (80).
6. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 to balance the allocation.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
