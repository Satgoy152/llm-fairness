Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29   3  21  91   6  40
1  86  96  76  20  88  23
2  10  56  41  11  23  65
3  21   7  15  46  16  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that considers the preferences (valuations) of each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Preferences**: Extract the valuations of each agent for each item.

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.

3. **Fairness Check**: Ensure that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged compared to others. This can be done by ensuring each agent gets at least one item or by equalizing the total valuation as much as possible.

4. **Final Allocation**: Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure fairness and that all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

**Valuations Table**:
- Agent 0: [29, 3, 21, 91, 6, 40]
- Agent 1: [86, 96, 76, 20, 88, 23]
- Agent 2: [10, 56, 41, 11, 23, 65]
- Agent 3: [21, 7, 15, 46, 16, 63]

**Allocation Strategy**:
1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (96).
2. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (91).
3. Agent 1 also values item 0 highly (86).
4. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (65).
5. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (88), but agent 3 also has a notable valuation for item 5 (63).

**Adjustments**:
- Since Agent 1 has already received two items (0 and 1), give item 4 to Agent 3 to ensure fairness.
- Item 2 can be allocated to Agent 0, as it balances Agent 0's allocation.

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: Items [3, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [5]
- Agent 3: Items [4]

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while considering their preferences.
