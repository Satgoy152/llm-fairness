Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  50  13  13  39  26
1  35  61  63  90  72  14
2  91  83  35  91  11  43
3  44  86  71  30  24   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations, we can proceed by attempting to assign the most valuable items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (23). 
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most (90). 
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (91), but since item 0 is allocated, we allocate item 3 (91) to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most (86).
5. For the remaining items, Agent 1 values item 2 more (63) than any other agent.
6. Agent 2 values item 5 the most (43) after item 0 and 3, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: item 4
- Agent 1: item 3, item 2
- Agent 2: item 0, item 5
- Agent 3: item 1

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```
