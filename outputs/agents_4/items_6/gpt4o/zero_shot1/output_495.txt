Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  34  47  65  79  23
1  72  52  40  77  25  86
2  29  63  55   6  50  26
3  41  33  95  57  35  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations, we can use a strategy similar to the "max-min fairness" approach. This method attempts to maximize the minimum value received by any agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Highest value items: 4 (79), 3 (65)
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Highest value items: 5 (86), 3 (77), 0 (72)
    - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Highest value items: 1 (63), 2 (55)
    - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
    - Highest value items: 2 (95)
    - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining items (0, 3) considering what's left and maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

- **Agent 0** gets item 3 (65) because it provides the next highest satisfaction.

- **Agent 1** gets item 0 (72) as it is the best remaining option for them.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
