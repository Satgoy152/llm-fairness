Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  36  44  18  47   4
1  25   4  64  56  66  48
2  85   2  93  73  89  55
3  90  10  42  83  14  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives for the items they are assigned. This approach will help ensure a fair distribution based on the agents' preferences.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 68
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 44
  - Item 3: 18
  - Item 4: 47
  - Item 5: 4

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 64
  - Item 3: 56
  - Item 4: 66
  - Item 5: 48

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 85
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 93
  - Item 3: 73
  - Item 4: 89
  - Item 5: 55

- Agent 3 values:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 83
  - Item 4: 14
  - Item 5: 40

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 (value 90)
2. Item 1: Agent 0 (value 36)
3. Item 2: Agent 2 (value 93)
4. Item 3: Agent 3 (value 83)
5. Item 4: Agent 2 (value 89)
6. Item 5: Agent 1 (value 48)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations for those items.
