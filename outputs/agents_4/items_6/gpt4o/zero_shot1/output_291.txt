Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  69  31   0   0   3
1   7  87  89  33  85  43
2  10  91  68  20  95  51
3  63  88  57  23  99  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we can use a method that involves maximizing the total value each agent receives from the items, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given that there are 6 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

To achieve a fair allocation, we will consider the valuations and try to balance the total value received by each agent:

1. Agent 1 has a high valuation for items 1, 2, and 4.
2. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4.
3. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4.
4. Agent 0 has lower valuations generally compared to the others.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing value:

- Agent 1 gets item 2, which has a high value for them (89).
- Agent 2 gets item 4, which is highly valued (95).
- Agent 3 gets item 1, which is highly valued (88).
- Agent 0 can get item 0, as it is the highest value item available to them (53).
  
Now, we have allocated 4 items, and need to allocate the remaining 2 items:

- Agent 1 can get item 5 (43), as it is the next highest value for them.
- Agent 3 can get item 3 (23), as it provides some value.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and takes into account the preferences of each agent as much as possible given the constraints.
