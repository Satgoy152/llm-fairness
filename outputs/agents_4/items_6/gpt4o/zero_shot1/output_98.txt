Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  24  19  97  63  15
1  49  47   7  87  69  97
2  14  82  98  15  22  13
3  97  69  35  80  65  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 24 19 97 63 15]
 [49 47  7 87 69 97]
 [14 82 98 15 22 13]
 [97 69 35 80 65 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value for item 0 (97) and item 3 (97).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for item 5 (97).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for item 2 (98).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value for item 1 (82) and item 4 (65).

This allocation ensures that each agent maximizes their benefit from the items they receive, while all items are fairly distributed among the agents.

Here's the allocation presented in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
