Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  56  54  44  97  58
1  11  92  52  80  21  39
2  82  52  75  70  25  14
3  11  84  74  67  67  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent. Let's follow these steps to determine the allocation:

1. List the value each agent has for each item.
2. Allocate items based on the highest value an agent has for an item, ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent.
3. Continue the allocation until all items are allocated, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the values:

- **Item 0:** 
  - Agent 0: 53
  - Agent 1: 11
  - Agent 2: 82
  - Agent 3: 11
  - Highest value: Agent 2

- **Item 1:**
  - Agent 0: 56
  - Agent 1: 92
  - Agent 2: 52
  - Agent 3: 84
  - Highest value: Agent 1

- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 0: 54
  - Agent 1: 52
  - Agent 2: 75
  - Agent 3: 74
  - Highest value: Agent 2

- **Item 3:**
  - Agent 0: 44
  - Agent 1: 80
  - Agent 2: 70
  - Agent 3: 67
  - Highest value: Agent 1

- **Item 4:**
  - Agent 0: 97
  - Agent 1: 21
  - Agent 2: 25
  - Agent 3: 67
  - Highest value: Agent 0

- **Item 5:**
  - Agent 0: 58
  - Agent 1: 39
  - Agent 2: 14
  - Agent 3: 42
  - Highest value: Agent 0

With this in mind, we can assign items as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 4, Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 1, Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 0, Item 2
- Agent 3: No items

Therefore, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": []
}
```
