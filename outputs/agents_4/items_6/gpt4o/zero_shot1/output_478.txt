Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  76   6  63  61  81
1  58   5  82  16  70  23
2  56  52  81  33  74   9
3  30  53  38  27  87  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we want to fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents based on their valuations. One common approach in fair division problems like this is to use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation or ensures each agent gets items they value highly, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize the total value while ensuring fairness. We can use a greedy approach where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. This method often provides a simple, fair allocation.

Let's go through each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 75.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 76.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 82.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 63.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most at 87.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 81.

Now, let's check if any agent receives too many items. Agent 0 has 4 items, while other agents have fewer, which might not be fair. A possible fairer allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Item 0, Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 5, Item 3

This allocation considers maximizing each agent's highest-valued items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's present the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and every item is allocated.
