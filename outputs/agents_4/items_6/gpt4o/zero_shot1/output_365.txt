Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  70  81  61  40  62
1  70  25   5  41  39  36
2  41  56  29  17  10  73
3  13  25  86  78  83   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 56 29 17 10 73]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items. We can approach this by trying to maximize the total value each agent derives from the items they receive. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (81), Item 1 (70)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (70)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (73)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (83), Item 3 (78)

Let's allocate the items based on these valuations:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 (second highest value for Agent 3).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
