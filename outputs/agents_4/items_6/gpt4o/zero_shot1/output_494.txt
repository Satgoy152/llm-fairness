Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  89  54  41  87  79
1  17  50   2  25  14  88
2  28  90  53   0  32  75
3   5  36  33  89  19  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns the highest valued item for each agent until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Start by reviewing the highest values each agent has for the items:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (89).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (88).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most (90).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (89).

2. Assign the highest value items to each agent:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 90).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 88).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 89).

3. Continue assigning the next highest value items that are not yet allocated:
   - Agent 0 can get item 4 (value 87).
   - Agent 1 can get item 0 (value 17).
   - Agent 2 can get item 2 (value 53).

Now that we have allocated all 6 items, the allocation looks like this:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to exactly one agent while trying to respect the preferences as much as possible.
