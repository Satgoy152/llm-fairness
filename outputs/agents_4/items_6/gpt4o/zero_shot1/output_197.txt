Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  39  79  18  85   3
1  88  67  39  83  73  53
2   4  18  85   1  66  92
3  10  44  20  83  42  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 4 agents and 6 items, we need to distribute the items such that no agent is left without an item.

Let's evaluate a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 0 significantly higher than any other agent does. Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a relatively high valuation for item 3. Allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 highly. Allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has a high valuation for item 1. Allocate item 1 to agent 3.

Now, we have assigned one item to each agent, and we have 2 items left: 2 and 4.

For the remaining items:
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 4 as compared to agents 2 and 3. Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

As a result, the allocation is:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 5.
- Agent 3 receives item 1.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1]
}
```
