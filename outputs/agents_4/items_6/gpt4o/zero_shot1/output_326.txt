Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  38  44  96  66  64
1  81   9   8  68  85  52
2  87  59  17  99  50  33
3  66   8  80  70  59  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent. One approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum weighted matching" in bipartite graphs, or simply attempt to assign the highest-valued items to each agent in a way that ensures all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (value 96), so assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (value 85), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (value 87), so assign item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (value 80), so assign item 2 to agent 3.

Now, we have assigned the highest-valued item to each agent and have two items left (items 1 and 5).

- For the remaining items, we can try to assign them based on the next highest valuation:
  - Agent 0's next highest preference from the remaining items is item 1 (value 38).
  - Agent 1's next highest preference from the remaining items is item 5 (value 52).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items among the 4 agents, taking into account each agent's highest-valued items and the remaining items.
