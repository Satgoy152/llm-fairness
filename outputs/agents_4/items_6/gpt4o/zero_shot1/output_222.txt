Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  50  75   6  60  12
1  11  44  45   4  67  11
2  20  81  32  78  62  39
3  24  73  86  53  62  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a potential approach to fairly distribute the items:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Look at each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate based on those preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.

2. **Ensure All Agents Get At Least One Item:** Since there are 6 items and 4 agents, some agents will get more than one item. We'll aim to distribute the remaining items to maximize satisfaction.

Based on this approach, here is one way the items could be allocated:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2, as these have high valuations for them.
- Agent 1 gets item 4, which is their highest valuation.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3, balancing their interests.
- Agent 3 gets item 5, as it is a reasonable choice given their other valuations.

Thus, the allocation can be represented in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
