Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  62  87  80  59  99
1  97  18  35  18  65  83
2  91  21  10  94  21  88
3  57  87  77  76   8  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[34 62 87 80 59 99]
 [97 18 35 18 65 83]
 [91 21 10 94 21 88]
 [57 87 77 76  8 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation of the items each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 2 and 5. Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 0. Assigning item 0 to Agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 3 the highest. Assigning item 3 to Agent 2 maximizes their satisfaction.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values items 1 and 4 highest among the remaining items. Assigning these two items to Agent 3 maximizes their satisfaction.

Based on this logic, here is one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all 6 items are allocated fairly based on their valuations.
