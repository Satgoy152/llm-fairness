Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  26  85  18  39  40
1  78  95  28  56  65  38
2  28  52  78  12  56  17
3  46  77   2  17  14  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering each agent's valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are distributed. One strategy is to use a greedy approach that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most.

Hereâ€™s how we can do this:

1. For each item, find the agent who values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each item is allocated only once.

Applying this method to the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 3      | 26     | 85     | 18     | 39     | 40     |
| 1     | 78     | 95     | 28     | 56     | 65     | 38     |
| 2     | 28     | 52     | 78     | 12     | 56     | 17     |
| 3     | 46     | 77     | 2      | 17     | 14     | 39     |

- Item 0: Highest value is 78 by Agent 1
- Item 1: Highest value is 95 by Agent 1
- Item 2: Highest value is 85 by Agent 0
- Item 3: Highest value is 56 by Agent 1
- Item 4: Highest value is 65 by Agent 1
- Item 5: Highest value is 40 by Agent 0

Based on the above allocation strategy, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": []
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 2 and 5, maximizing their high valuation for these items. Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, 3, and 4, which are items they value highly. Agents 2 and 3 receive no items in this allocation.
