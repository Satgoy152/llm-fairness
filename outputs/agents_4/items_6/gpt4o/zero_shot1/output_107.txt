Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  41  53  51  24  25
1  79   7  76  49  27  97
2  19  68   3   1  19  31
3  32  51  30  18  93  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19 68  3  1 19 31]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Since there are 4 agents and 6 items, not all agents will receive an item. 

Let's proceed with an allocation based on the highest individual valuations for each item:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 79, the highest among all agents.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values it at 68, the highest among all agents.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 76, the highest among all agents.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51, the highest among all agents.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 3 values it at 93, the highest among all agents.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 97, the highest among all agents.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these selections:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 4

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```
