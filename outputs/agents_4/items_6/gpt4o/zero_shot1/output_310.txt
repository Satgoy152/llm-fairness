Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  15  14  16  33  98
1  48  78  33  62  80  80
2  19  40  41  17  78  48
3  23   9  55  35  85  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents given their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one way to do it:

Let's consider the items one by one and assign them to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 62
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - Agent 3 values it at 23
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 15
   - Agent 1 values it at 78
   - Agent 2 values it at 40
   - Agent 3 values it at 9
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 14
   - Agent 1 values it at 33
   - Agent 2 values it at 41
   - Agent 3 values it at 55
   - Allocate to Agent 3

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 62
   - Agent 2 values it at 17
   - Agent 3 values it at 35
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 33
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 78
   - Agent 3 values it at 85
   - Allocate to Agent 3

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 98
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - Agent 3 values it at 61
   - Allocate to Agent 0

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 6 items distributed, and items are assigned to the agent who values them the most.
