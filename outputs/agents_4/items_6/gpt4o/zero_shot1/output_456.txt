Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  50  78  85  69  32
1  52  25  36  35  23  25
2  84  51  70  29  24  53
3  77   6  83  98  53  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 50 78 85 69 32]
 [52 25 36 35 23 25]
 [84 51 70 29 24 53]
 [77  6 83 98 53 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations of each item by each agent. A reasonable approach is to try to maximize the total valuation for all agents by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This can be achieved by examining the table and selecting the highest value for each item.

Let's break down the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 84.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 50.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 83.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 98.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 69.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 53.

Based on this, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 3

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
