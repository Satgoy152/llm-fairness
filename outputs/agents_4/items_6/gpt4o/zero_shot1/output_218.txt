Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73   4  66  80  70  81
1  84  40  21  17  96  89
2  36  28  58  80  36  67
3  44  41  46  74  45  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of value based on their preferences. However, since we have more items than agents, we need to distribute the six items such that the allocation is as balanced as possible considering the agents' valuations.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (80), followed closely by item 5 (81).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (96), followed by item 5 (89).
- Agent 2 values items 3 (80) and 5 (67) the most.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (74).

To ensure a fair distribution, let's proceed with the following allocation strategy, aiming to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. Assign the highest-valued item for each agent first, if possible.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, and balance the remaining items based on the next highest valuations.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.

This allocation attempts to give each agent a high-value item according to their preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated. Let's present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
