Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  26  78  57  42  55
1  77  16  68  46  78  96
2  52  98  40  65  37  79
3  83  99  38  46  40  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Start by considering each agent's top-valued items and try to allocate those items to them, balancing out to ensure fairness.
2. Take note of ensuring that each agent has a reasonable allocation and no item is left unallocated.

Let's follow through with this allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (78) and can get item 5 as well since it has a relatively high valuation (55).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (96) but since it is already allocated, we allocate item 4, which is highly valued (78).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (98) and can get item 3 as well with a reasonable valuation (65).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (99), but since it is already allocated, we allocate item 0, which has a high valuation (83).

Considering these allocations, here is the proposed solution:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their valuation preferences.
