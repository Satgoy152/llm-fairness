Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  78  26  80  47  78
1  62  87  90  75  26  95
2  14  46  27  17  59  23
3   3  89  90  34  65  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - Agent 0 values items quite evenly but has a preference for item 3.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 2 and 5.
   - Agent 2 doesn't have high values for any item in particular, but item 4 is the highest.
   - Agent 3 highly values items 1 and 2.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign items to maximize individual agent satisfaction based on their highest valuations and ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

3. **Allocation**:

   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (Value: 80).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (Value: 95).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (Value: 59).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (Value: 90).

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 0 and 1 are left to be assigned.

5. **Final Allocation**:

   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (Value: 76).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (Value: 89).

6. **Final JSON Allocation**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent getting at least one item, maximizing their individual preferences based on the given valuations.
