Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  63  89  73  11  14
1  92  47  50  22   8  50
2   1   7  55  30  30   2
3  98  80  14  32  82  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no more than all items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest marginal increase in total valuation for each agent. However, since we have four agents and six items, we need to ensure the allocation is fair and balanced.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Each agent should get approximately 1.5 items, but since each must get an integer number of items, a feasible distribution is two agents receive 1 item each and two agents receive 2 items each.

2. **Allocation Process**:
   - Start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent.
   - Then, allocate the remaining items by considering which agent values them the most and hasn't reached their allocation limit.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations on items 2 and 3. Allocate item 2 first, then item 3.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations on items 0 and 5. Allocate item 0 first, then item 5.
   - Agent 3 has high valuations on items 0 and 4. After item 0 is taken, allocate item 4.
   - Agent 2 has only low valuations, allocate item 1.

4. **Ensure Fairness**:
   - Check that no agent exceeds their item allocation limit and that all items are distributed.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.
- Agent 3 receives item 4.
