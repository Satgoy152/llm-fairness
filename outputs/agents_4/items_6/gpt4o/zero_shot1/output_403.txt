Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  23  14  86  29  36
1  53  45  88  40  80  54
2   6  42   4  16  96   9
3  29  88  51  12  36  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should look for a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations. Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (86)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (88)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (96)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (88)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.

At this point, each agent has been assigned one item. There are two items left (0 and 5) to allocate. Let's proceed by considering the next highest valuations for each agent for the remaining items.

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 0:
     - Agent 1 values it at 53, which is the highest among the remaining options.
     - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

   - Item 5:
     - Agent 3 values it at 65, which is the highest among the remaining options.
     - Assign Item 5 to Agent 3.

Now each item is allocated, and each agent has received a fair allocation based on their valuations. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
