Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  69  16  86  38   2
1  10  70  33  83  36  62
2  54  27  29  26  89  54
3  33  64  74  43  82  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring that every agent receives a fair share of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Create a list of all items with their valuations for each agent.** This will help us sort the items by value for each agent.

2. **Sort the items for each agent in descending order of value.** This will allow us to assign the most valuable items first.

3. **Allocate items to agents by iterating through the sorted lists.** Start with the highest-valued item for each agent and allocate it if it's not already taken. Continue to the next highest-valued item until all items are allocated.

4. **Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.** Since there are 4 agents and 6 items, some agents may receive more items than others, but this will be balanced by ensuring that each agent gets the highest possible value from their allocated items.

Based on the above steps, here is the fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 3: 86
  - Item 1: 69
  - Item 4: 38
  - Item 2: 16
  - Item 5: 2

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 3: 83
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 5: 62
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 4: 36
  - Item 0: 10

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 4: 89
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 5: 54
  - Item 2: 29
  - Item 3: 26
  - Item 1: 27

- Agent 3 values:
  - Item 2: 74
  - Item 4: 82
  - Item 5: 56
  - Item 1: 64
  - Item 3: 43
  - Item 0: 33

**Allocations:**

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).

Now, two items remain to be allocated (Item 1 and Item 5).

5. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```
