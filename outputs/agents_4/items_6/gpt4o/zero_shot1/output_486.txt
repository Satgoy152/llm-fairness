Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  57  84  44  42  68
1  75  73  73  86  34  56
2  86  88  98  18  43   1
3  89  64  42  68  95  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 57 84 44 42 68]
 [75 73 73 86 34 56]
 [86 88 98 18 43  1]
 [89 64 42 68 95 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or utility for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no more than two items since there are 6 items and 4 agents.

Let's analyze and allocate:

1. **Agent 0**: Values are [81, 57, 84, 44, 42, 68]
   - Highest value: Item 2 (84)
   
2. **Agent 1**: Values are [75, 73, 73, 86, 34, 56]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (86)
   
3. **Agent 2**: Values are [86, 88, 98, 18, 43, 1]
   - Highest value: Item 2 (98)
   - Second highest value: Item 1 (88)
   
4. **Agent 3**: Values are [89, 64, 42, 68, 95, 17]
   - Highest value: Item 4 (95)
   - Second highest value: Item 0 (89)

To ensure fairness and maximize total value:

- **Assign Item 2** to Agent 2 (Highest value)
- **Assign Item 3** to Agent 1 (Highest value)
- **Assign Item 4** to Agent 3 (Highest value)
- **Assign Item 0** to Agent 3 (Second highest value)
- **Assign Item 1** to Agent 2 (Second highest value)
- **Assign Item 5** to Agent 0 (Next highest value available to Agent 0)

This way, each of the 4 agents receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [4, 0]
}
```
