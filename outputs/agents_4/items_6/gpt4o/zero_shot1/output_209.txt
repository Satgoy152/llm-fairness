Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  10  26  76   9  48  88
1  49  59  81  71  51  53
2  83  99  27  27  81  54
3   6   1  90  38  29  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use a simple method where we try to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest valuation is for item 5 (88), followed by item 2 (76). 
   - Allocating item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - The highest valuation is for item 2 (81), but it's already allocated. 
   - The next highest available is item 3 (71).
   - Allocating item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - The highest valuation is for item 1 (99).
   - Allocating item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - The highest valuation is for item 2 (90), but it's already allocated. 
   - The next highest available is item 3 (38), but it's already allocated.
   - The next highest available for Agent 3 is item 0 (6).
   - Allocating item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 4 is unallocated. The highest unallocated valuation for item 4 is Agent 0 (48).
  - Allocating item 4 to Agent 0.

- Item 5 is unallocated. The highest unallocated valuation for item 5 is Agent 0 (88), but Agent 0 already has two items.
  - The next highest unallocated valuation for item 5 is Agent 2 (54).
  - Allocating item 5 to Agent 2.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
