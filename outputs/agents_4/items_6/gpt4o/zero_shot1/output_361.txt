Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  37   2  10   6  88
1  53  24  50  37  11  15
2  33   2  92  98  81  67
3  61  53  55  56  66  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33  2 92 98 81 67]
 [61 53 55 56 66 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. We will consider each agent's preferences and ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while no agent gets more than 2 items since there are 4 agents and 6 items.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (88), Item 1 (37)

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (53), Item 2 (50)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (98), Item 2 (92)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 0 (61), Item 4 (66)

Let's attempt an allocation that balances high valuations:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for this item).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (high valuation and not as highly valued by Agent 0 as item 5).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for this item).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 3 (Agent 2 already has item 3, and Agent 3 values item 2 reasonably well).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation after item 5).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 (reasonably high valuation, and Agent 3 needs a second item).

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
