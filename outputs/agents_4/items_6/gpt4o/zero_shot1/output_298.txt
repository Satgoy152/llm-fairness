Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  33  45  38  49  82
1  94  34  20  56  91   3
2  46  65  91  32  83   8
3  90  70   8  42  26  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 6 items and 4 agents, it's not possible for each agent to receive the same number of items, so we need to balance the distribution as best as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 0 and also a relatively high value for item 5. We will allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 1 and 4. We'll allocate these two items to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 2. We will allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 the most. We will allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
