Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  29  85  89  35  73
1  76  50  10  50   0   0
2  97  65   0  15  39  71
3   9  38  92  55  99  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction or value based on the agents' valuations of the items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Items 0 (94), 2 (85), 3 (89)
   - Allocate items 0, 2, 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Items 0 (76), 1 (50), 3 (50)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0, and item 3 is a lower priority for distribution).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Items 0 (97), 1 (65), 5 (71)
   - Allocate items 5 to Agent 2 (since items 0 and 1 are already allocated).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Items 4 (99), 2 (92)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0).

The allocation of the items is complete, with each item assigned to exactly one agent and considering their preferences.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, considering their highest valuations for fair distribution.
