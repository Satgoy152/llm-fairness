Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  80  68  60  92  89
1  83  90  42  71  15  74
2  15   6  38  55  87  26
3   7  59  50  31  63  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider a strategy that maximizes the total valuation or ensures fair distribution based on preferences. Let's consider each agent's highest-valued items first and attempt to allocate them accordingly.

Here is a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (92), Item 5 (89), Item 1 (80)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (90), Item 0 (83), Item 5 (74)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (87), Item 3 (55), Item 2 (38)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (59), Item 4 (63), Item 2 (50)

Next, allocate the items:

- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for 0 and second highest for 2).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for 1).
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (second highest value for 1 but highest for 0 among remaining).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest value for 1).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for 2 among remaining).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 3 (highest value for 3 among remaining).

This allocation gives each agent a fair chance based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This ensures that each item is allocated and respects the highest preferences of each agent as much as possible.
