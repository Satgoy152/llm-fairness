Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  90  66  54  73  79
1  88  97  16  83  29  67
2  83  52  46  60  60  44
3  47  93  74  24  32   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation of items each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Let's consider possible allocations that distribute the items while trying to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (90), Item 5 (79), Item 2 (66)
   - Allocate: Item 1

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (97), Item 0 (88), Item 3 (83)
   - Allocate: Item 0

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (83), Item 3 (60), Item 4 (60)
   - Allocate: Item 3

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (93), Item 2 (74), Item 0 (47)
   - Allocate: Item 2

### Remaining Items:

- Items left: 4, 5

### Allocate Remaining Items:

5. **Agent 2**: 
   - Choose between Item 4 (60) and Item 5 (44)
   - Allocate: Item 4

6. **Agent 0**: 
   - Choose between Item 4 (60) and Item 5 (79)
   - Allocate: Item 5

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on the given valuations.
