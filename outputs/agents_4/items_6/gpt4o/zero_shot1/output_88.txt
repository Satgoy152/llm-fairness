Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  99   3  68   8  51
1  70  42  92  69   7  92
2   9  64  50  68  69  90
3   0   9  98  65  14  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[23 99  3 68  8 51]
 [70 42 92 69  7 92]
 [ 9 64 50 68 69 90]
 [ 0  9 98 65 14 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. We can approach this by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent based on their preferences.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [23, 99, 3, 68, 8, 51]
- Agent 1 values: [70, 42, 92, 69, 7, 92]
- Agent 2 values: [9, 64, 50, 68, 69, 90]
- Agent 3 values: [0, 9, 98, 65, 14, 72]

We will try to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total value for their assigned items.

1. Agent 0: The highest value is for item 1 (99).
2. Agent 1: The highest values are for items 2 and 5 (92 each). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2: The highest value is for item 5 (90).
4. Agent 3: The highest value is for item 2 (98), but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 3 (65).

Now we have allocated items 1, 2, 3, and 5. We need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 4.

- Agent 0 can get item 0 (23).
- Agent 2 can get item 4 (69).

This results in the following allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5
- Agent 3: Item 3

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
