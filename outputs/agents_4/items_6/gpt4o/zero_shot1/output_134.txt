Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  97  64  14  89  98
1  25  61  37  68  16  45
2  50  14  57   6  98  79
3  24  50  85  25  49  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 97 64 14 89 98]
 [25 61 37 68 16 45]
 [50 14 57  6 98 79]
 [24 50 85 25 49 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [94, 97, 64, 14, 89, 98]
Agent 1: [25, 61, 37, 68, 16, 45]
Agent 2: [50, 14, 57, 6, 98, 79]
Agent 3: [24, 50, 85, 25, 49, 24]
```

We'll try to allocate items to maximize total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 0, 1, and 5. We'll assign item 5 to Agent 0 since it has the highest value.
   
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest. We'll assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 4. We'll assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the highest. We'll assign item 2 to Agent 3.

So far, we have allocated items 2, 3, 4, and 5. We still have items 0 and 1 to allocate:

5. Since items 0 and 1 have high values for Agent 0, we can assign item 0 to Agent 0.

6. Finally, assign item 1 to Agent 1 to balance the allocation and improve their total value.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets their fairly valued items while all items are allocated.
