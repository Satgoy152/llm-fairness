Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  81  27  71  74  61
1  44  66  57   0   0   5
2  85  99  68   1  19  34
3  97  60  42  33   8   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. To achieve this distribution, we will consider each agent's highest-valued items and allocate accordingly, ensuring no repetition and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (81), followed by item 4 (74).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (57), followed by item 1 (66).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (99), followed by item 0 (85).
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (97), followed by item 1 (60).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 3 should receive item 0, as they value it the highest.
- Agent 2 should receive item 1, as they value it the highest.
- Agent 1 should receive item 2, as they value it the highest.
- Agent 0 should receive item 4, as it is their second-highest valuation not yet assigned.
- Agent 0 should receive item 5, maximizing their total valuation.
- Agent 3 should receive item 3, as it increases their total value.

Based on this strategy, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, and no items are left unallocated.
