Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  72  16  25  39  36
1  22  18  62  31  33  92
2  13   5  62  25  24  78
3  17  12  77  48  23  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that considers the preferences of each agent. One possible approach is to assign items to agents based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. We will aim to balance the allocations by considering the highest possible valuations for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate those first.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Check that no more than 6 items are allocated in total.

Let's proceed:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (75), so item 0 is allocated to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5 (92), so item 5 is allocated to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (62), so item 2 is allocated to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2 as well, but since item 2 is already taken, we allocate item 3 (48) to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We will allocate the remaining 2 items by considering the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0's next highest is item 1 (72), which is unallocated, so item 1 goes to agent 0.
- Agent 1's next highest item is 2, but it's already taken. The next available is item 4 (33), so item 4 goes to agent 1.

Now, all 6 items have been allocated. The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.
