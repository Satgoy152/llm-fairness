Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  86  68  46  90  95
1  77  15  74  94  79  35
2  12  73  39   3  95  44
3  43  94   4  95  63  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56 86 68 46 90 95]
 [77 15 74 94 79 35]
 [12 73 39  3 95 44]
 [43 94  4 95 63 92]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's consider the following approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Check if each agent has at least one item. If not, adjust by swapping items between agents to ensure fairness.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (77).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (94).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (68).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (95).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (95).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (95).

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 5
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 1, 3

### Verification:
- Total items allocated: 6
- Each agent has at least one item.
- Allocation is as fair as possible according to the valuations.

Therefore, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
