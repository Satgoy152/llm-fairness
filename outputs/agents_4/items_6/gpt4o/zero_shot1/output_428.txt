Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  67  30  31   7  48
1  59  43  57  21  41   0
2  86  69  15  52   5  65
3  89   5  95  56  40  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89  5 95 56 40 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share of value according to their preferences. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the sum of values for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated exactly once.

Let's analyze the valuations to determine a fair allocation:

### Valuations Table:
```
Agent/Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5
-----------------------------------
     0     | 86  67  30  31   7  48
     1     | 59  43  57  21  41   0
     2     | 86  69  15  52   5  65
     3     | 89   5  95  56  40  91
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (95) and item 5 (91). These should be allocated to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (86). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** values items 1 (67) and 3 (31) relatively well. Allocate these items to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** will receive item 4 (41), which is the highest remaining value for Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets items 2 and 5.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation should reasonably balance the value each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated.
