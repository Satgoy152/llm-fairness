Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  76  53  97  69  64
1  64  74  68  89  67  66
2  26  73  75  73  82  17
3  14  79  60  65  25   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 76 53 97 69 64]
 [64 74 68 89 67 66]
 [26 73 75 73 82 17]
 [14 79 60 65 25  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. We aim to maximize the total satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  76  53  97  69  64
1  64  74  68  89  67  66
2  26  73  75  73  82  17
3  14  79  60  65  25   3
```

- Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 has relatively even valuations but values item 4 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most.

Letâ€™s allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Best valued by Agent 0; give item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Best valued by Agent 3; give item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Best valued by Agent 2; give item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Best valued by Agent 0; give item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Best valued by Agent 2; give item 4 to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Best valued by Agent 1; give item 5 to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation, each agent will receive:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4
- Agent 3: Item 1

Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
