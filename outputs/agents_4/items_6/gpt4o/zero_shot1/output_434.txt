Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  82  58  38  31  96
1  82   1  51  19  49  45
2   9  17  65  15  45  97
3  38  35  60  89  29  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's take a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for item 0 (99) and item 5 (96).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for item 0 (82) and item 2 (51).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are for item 5 (97) and item 2 (65).
   - Agent 3: Highest values are for item 3 (89) and item 5 (93).

2. **Allocate Items with Highest Valuations:**
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the most at 99.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the most at 97.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 82.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 65, but it's already satisfied with item 5. Next, agent 3 values it at 60.
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 89.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 49.

4. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0, Item 1.
   - Agent 1: Item 4.
   - Agent 2: Item 5.
   - Agent 3: Item 2, Item 3.

5. **Verify That The Total Number of Items Allocated is 6:**
   - Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Based on this allocation, here is the final JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
