Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  50  48  21  72  19
1  87  96  64  31  16  41
2  98  35  73  41  68  52
3  18  10  35  89  45  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the satisfaction for all agents. We will aim for an allocation where each agent receives an item that they value highly, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (72).
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (96).
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (98).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (89).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

Now we have items 2 and 5 remaining. We will allocate these based on the next highest valuations:

5. **Agent 0** has already been allocated item 4, but let's consider other allocations:
   - Next highest available valuation for agent 0 is item 2 (48).

6. **Agent 1, 2, and 3** have already been allocated their highest-valued items. Let's allocate based on remaining preferences:
   - Agent 2 has a high value for item 5 (52), which is not yet allocated.

By allocating item 2 to agent 0 and item 5 to agent 2, we ensure all items are allocated while maximizing the satisfaction based on the given valuations.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
