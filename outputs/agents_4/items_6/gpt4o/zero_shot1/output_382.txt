Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  84   8  43  43  17
1  16  98  74  46  29  11
2  76  69  17  51  35  76
3  61  77   6  44  56  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16 98 74 46 29 11]
 [76 69 17 51 35 76]
 [61 77  6 44 56 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives by assigning items in a way that balances the total valuations.

Here's how we might approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 40, 84, 8, 43, 43, 17
   - Agent 1: 16, 98, 74, 46, 29, 11
   - Agent 2: 76, 69, 17, 51, 35, 76
   - Agent 3: 61, 77, 6, 44, 56, 52

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (76)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (98)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (74)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (51)
   - Item 4: Agent 3 (56)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (76)

Now let's check that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 6:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - No items assigned.

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Receives items 1 and 2.

- **Agent 2:** 
  - Receives items 0, 3, and 5.

- **Agent 3:** 
  - Receives item 4.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their highest valuations while ensuring that only 6 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```
