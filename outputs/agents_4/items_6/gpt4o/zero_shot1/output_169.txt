Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1   3  82  45  44  24
1  26  81  54   1  66  79
2  92  20  55  48  75  11
3  65  77  55  36  77  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1  3 82 45 44 24]
 [26 81 54  1 66 79]
 [92 20 55 48 75 11]
 [65 77 55 36 77 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items allocated to them. Given the valuations, we can proceed to distribute items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 82. Allocating item 2 to Agent 0 would maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 81. Allocating item 1 to Agent 1 would maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 92. Allocating item 0 to Agent 2 would maximize their satisfaction.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 77. Allocating item 4 to Agent 3 would maximize their satisfaction.

Now, we have items 3 and 5 remaining. We can distribute these items to further maximize the fairness among the agents:

5. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 the second highest at 79. Allocating item 5 to Agent 1 would complement their allocation.

6. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the second highest at 36. Allocating item 3 to Agent 3 would complement their allocation.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with a total of 6 items distributed fairly based on their valuations.
