Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  73  68  27  53  73
1  82  13  81  86  37  82
2  52  83  34  17  25  48
3  51  23  23  24  25  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total satisfaction of the agents. One approach is to allocate the item to the agent who values it the most. Here's the step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is 82 by agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is 83 by agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 81 by agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 86 by agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 53 by agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is 82 by agent 1.

Since agent 1 cannot be allocated all items, we need to adjust the allocations to ensure fairness. Let's distribute the items while respecting the highest valuations but ensuring no agent gets all or no items:

1. **Item 0**: Allocate to agent 1 (value 82).
2. **Item 1**: Allocate to agent 2 (value 83).
3. **Item 2**: Allocate to agent 1 (value 81).
4. **Item 3**: Allocate to agent 1 (value 86).
5. **Item 4**: Allocate to agent 0 (value 53).
6. **Item 5**: Allocate to agent 3 (value 81).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and it is distributed fairly:

- Agent 0: Items [4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [1]
- Agent 3: Items [5]

This allocation provides a fair distribution, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5]
}
```
