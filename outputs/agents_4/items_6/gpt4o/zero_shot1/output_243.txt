Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  77  38  68  74  20
1  33  18  54  35  12  74
2  56  71  11  24  70  49
3  83  74  14  72  64  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[69 77 38 68 74 20]
 [33 18 54 35 12 74]
 [56 71 11 24 70 49]
 [83 74 14 72 64 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a heuristic approach to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
3. Balance the allocation so that no agent receives too many more items than others.

Let's analyze the table and proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (83).
- Item 1: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (77).
- Item 2: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (54).
- Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (68).
- Item 4: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (74).
- Item 5: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (74).

Let's allocate these items to ensure fairness and balance:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 0

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize each agent's total valuation.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
