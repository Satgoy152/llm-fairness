Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  76  19  20  48  90
1  78   6  86  10  61  14
2  23  70  27  15  18  94
3  91  24  48   8  14  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to optimize the overall satisfaction by considering the values each agent has for the items. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's analyze the given table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  76  19  20  48  90
1  78   6  86  10  61  14
2  23  70  27  15  18  94
3  91  24  48   8  14  74
```

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Item 0:** The highest value is 92 by agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** The highest value is 76 by agent 0.
3. **Item 2:** The highest value is 86 by agent 1.
4. **Item 3:** The highest value is 20 by agent 0.
5. **Item 4:** The highest value is 61 by agent 1.
6. **Item 5:** The highest value is 94 by agent 2.

However, agent 0 would receive too many items in this distribution. Let's distribute evenly:

1. **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 5.
2. **Agent 1** gets items 2 and 4.
3. **Agent 2** gets item 1.
4. **Agent 3** gets item 3.

This allocation provides a fair distribution of items while considering agents' preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
