Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  62  55   6  25   9
1   5  12  45  64  81  61
2  15  68  30  21  36  52
3  29  24   7  23  48  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider distributing the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. We can employ a method that aims to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item as best as possible. However, given there are 4 agents and 6 items, some agents may receive more than others.

Let's proceed to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is for agent 0 (65).
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is for agent 2 (68).
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is for agent 1 (45).
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is for agent 1 (64).
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is for agent 1 (81).
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is for agent 1 (61).

Now we have an issue where agent 1 is getting too many items. Let's adjust to ensure a more balanced distribution:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to agent 3 (since agent 1 is overallocated, and agent 3 can take 7).
- Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (since agent 1 is overallocated, agent 0 values it reasonably well with 9).

With this distribution, we ensure that all items are allocated fairly, and each agent gets at least one item.

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2]
}
```
