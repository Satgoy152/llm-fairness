Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  61  30  67  26  50
1  59  31  59  37  13  27
2  43  12  36  41  23  20
3  65   2  82  22  82  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation, while ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent and each agent can have between 0 and 6 items in total. 

Let's consider different approaches to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Highest Valuation Allocation**: Each agent is assigned items for which they have the highest valuation compared to other agents.

2. **Maximizing Individual Satisfaction**: Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes total valuations or happiness.

In this scenario, let's try to maximize the sum of the valuations for each agent. Here's how we can allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 2 will get item 0, which is the next highest valuation for them considering the remaining items.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for items 4 and 5.

Therefore, a fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [1, 4, 5]

Given the constraints and maximizing the total valuation for each agent, here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
