Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  88  69  19  82  49
1  62  87  16   2  38  25
2  97  24  61  30   9  54
3   1  87  98  68  25  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and no item is allocated to more than one agent. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Allocate Based on Highest Valuations**: Allocate items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

3. **Adjust if Necessary**: If any agent ends up with no items after the initial allocation, adjust the allocations to ensure all agents have at least one item.

Let's apply these steps to the given valuations:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 2 (97)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (88)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 3 (98)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 3 (68)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (82)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 2 (54)

Now, allocate these items to the respective agents:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 1: No items allocated yet
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 3

Since Agent 1 does not have any items yet, we need to reallocate to ensure all agents receive at least one item. Let's adjust the allocation slightly:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 3

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
