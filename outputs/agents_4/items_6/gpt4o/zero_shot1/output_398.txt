Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  58  36   8  24  52
1  33   6  10  75  35  11
2  89  77  53  28  51  43
3  82  90  64  65  46  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided by each agent for each item. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm, assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze the data and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is by Agent 2 (89).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (90).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (64).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (75).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is by Agent 2 (51).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (52).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

After this allocation, each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0 receives Item 5.
- Agent 1 receives Item 3.
- Agent 2 receives Items 0 and 4.
- Agent 3 receives Items 1 and 2.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
