Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  85  95  17  32  90
1  18  21  88  94  14  62
2  34  48  24  40  96  73
3  69   3  99  51  46  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We have 4 agents and 6 items, and each item must be allocated to exactly one agent.

Here's a potential strategy to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values items 3 and 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values items 4 and 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values items 2 and 3.

Using a greedy approach, we can allocate items to maximize individual agent satisfaction while ensuring each item is only allocated once.

Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives item 0 (value 92).
- **Agent 1** receives item 3 (value 94).
- **Agent 2** receives item 4 (value 96).
- **Agent 3** receives item 2 (value 99).
- Allocate the remaining items (1 and 5) to maximize leftover value:
  - **Agent 0** receives item 5 (value 90).
  - **Agent 2** receives item 1 (value 48).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total valuation is maximized based on the given preferences.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation uses all 6 items while considering the agents' preferences.
