Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8   3  99  79  50  21
1   8  26   4  54  74   7
2  44   3  61  17  97  41
3  56   3  45  72  50  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44  3 61 17 97 41]

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (99) and item 3 (79). Assign item 2 to Agent 0 as it is the highest valued by any agent for any item.
   
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (74). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (97), but since item 4 is already allocated, consider the next highest value. Assign item 0 (44) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (75). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items out of the 6.

5. Consider the remaining items (1, 3) and assign them to agents with relatively higher valuations for them.

   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly (79), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - For item 1, Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation (26) among the unallocated items, so assign item 1 to Agent 1.

Now, all 6 items are allocated, and each agent has an integer number of items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5]
}
```
