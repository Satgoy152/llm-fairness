Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  94  12  47   8  69
1  78  50  26  81  95  45
2  34  61   4  60  80  79
3  25  29  87  78  21  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[23 94 12 47  8 69]
 [78 50 26 81 95 45]
 [34 61  4 60 80 79]
 [25 29 87 78 21 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance the total valuations:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 1. (Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 78.)
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 0. (Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 94.)
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 3. (Agent 3 values item 2 the most at 87.)
4. Allocate item 3 to agent 1. (Agent 1 values item 3 highly at 81.)
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 2. (Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 80.)
6. Allocate item 5 to agent 2. (Agent 2 also values item 5 highly at 79.)

Now, each agent has an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```
