Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  73   2  17  68  57
1  65  65  86   3  84  46
2  65  27  45   9  56  48
3  24  62  77  75  18  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's highest-valued items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Determine the highest value item for each agent, then check for potential conflicts where multiple agents highly value the same item.
2. Try to resolve conflicts by assigning items based on the second-highest preferences if necessary, ensuring each agent ends up with an item.
3. Allocate the remaining items to the agents based on their higher preferences from the remaining unallocated items.

Based on the table:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (tied with item 1, but item 0 is available after agent 0's choice).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:
- Item 3 and item 4 are left. Let's check who values them next:
  - Agent 0's next highest value is item 4 (68).
  - Agent 1's next highest value is item 4 (84), but since agent 1 already has item 2, let's consider fairness.
  - Agent 2's next highest value is item 4 (56).
  - Agent 3's next highest value is item 3 (75).

Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, and item 3 to Agent 3.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items have been distributed and each agent has at least one item, with an emphasis on their highest preferences.
