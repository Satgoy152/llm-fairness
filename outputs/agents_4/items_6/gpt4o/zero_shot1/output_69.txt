Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  68  25  71   1  72
1  90  33  54  87  53  66
2  51  26  71  77  71  15
3  52  38  13  72   9  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. We have four agents and six items, which means some agents may receive more than one item while others might receive fewer.

Let's proceed with the allocation by trying to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items: 5 (72), 3 (71), 1 (68)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items: 0 (90), 3 (87), 5 (66)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items: 2 (71), 4 (71), 3 (77)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations are for items: 3 (72), 0 (52), 5 (43)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

We have allocated four items so far (5, 0, 3, 1). We need to allocate the remaining two items (2 and 4).

5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it highly (71).
6. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it (53).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total allocations sum to six items.
