Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  12  85  16  65  99
1  30  57  41  10   3  66
2  21  46  79  12  14  27
3   3  95  88  43  68  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 45.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most at 95.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most at 43.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 65.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0 has 4 items ([0, 2, 4, 5]).
- Agent 1 and Agent 2 have no items yet.
- Agent 3 has 2 items ([1, 3]).

To balance the allocations a bit, we can reallocate items where possible:

- Reallocate Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it at 14, which is second to Agent 0's valuation.
- Now Agent 2 has 1 item ([4]).

This leaves Agent 1 without any items. We can adjust by reallocating:

- Item 3 or Item 1 to Agent 1, but since Agent 1 has a higher valuation for Item 2 (41, which is next highest after Agent 0's 85), we move Item 3 to Agent 1.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item based on the highest valuations, maintaining a fair distribution.
