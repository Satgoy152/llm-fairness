Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  41  54  94  96  92
1  92  16  56  75  46   2
2  71  60  19  93  15  51
3  22  28   5  45  64  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to consider the preferences and valuations each agent has for the items. We want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocations are balanced in terms of the total value each agent receives. Here's an approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Start by looking at the highest valuations for each agent and try to allocate the items accordingly to maximize the overall satisfaction.

2. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Make sure that each item is allocated to one agent only and that all items are distributed.

3. **Balance the Allocations**: Try to balance the total value received by each agent as much as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values items 3, 4, and 5. However, item 4 has a higher value for another agent. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0 since it has a high value (94) and there is no other agent with a higher preference for item 3.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (92), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1 (60) compared to others, so item 1 will go to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 can be allocated item 5, as it has a decent value for it (85) and is not highly valued by others.
- Agent 0 can take item 4 because it has a very high value (96) and is the highest among the agents.
- Finally, item 2 can be given to Agent 1 as they value it decently (56) and it helps to balance their allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items distributed is 6.
