Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  76  72  36  12  75
1  82  26  96  86  21  96
2  96  25  74  12  11  38
3  68  13  65  20  49  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 76 72 36 12 75]
 [82 26 96 86 21 96]
 [96 25 74 12 11 38]
 [68 13 65 20 49 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One method is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the table and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest with 96.
   
2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest with 76.
   
3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest with 96.
   
4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest with 86.
   
5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 3 values it the highest with 49.
   
6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest with 96.

Now let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0: Assign Item 1 (76)
- Agent 1: Assign Items 2, 3, and 5 (96, 86, 96)
- Agent 2: Assign Item 0 (96)
- Agent 3: Assign Item 4 (49)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```
