Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  20  84  12  24  47
1  86  84  91  99  49  29
2  55  65  32  59  14  14
3  19  52  71  65   0   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Sum the valuations of all items for each agent to understand their overall preference strength.
2. **Allocate Based on Highest Valuations:** Assign items to agents who value them the most until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this method:

### Step 1: Total Valuation for Each Agent
- Agent 0: 60 + 20 + 84 + 12 + 24 + 47 = 247
- Agent 1: 86 + 84 + 91 + 99 + 49 + 29 = 438
- Agent 2: 55 + 65 + 32 + 59 + 14 + 14 = 239
- Agent 3: 19 + 52 + 71 + 65 + 0 + 5 = 212

### Step 2: Allocate Items Based on Individual Item Valuation
- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (86)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (84)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (91)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (99)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (49)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (47), but Agent 1 is already getting 5 items

Agent 1 cannot take all items, so we distribute some items to other agents:

- Item 0: Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 0 (next highest value 20)
- Item 2: Agent 1
- Item 3: Agent 2 (next highest value 59)
- Item 4: Agent 1
- Item 5: Agent 0

Now, let's format these allocations in JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures every item is distributed while considering the highest valuations and spreading the allocation across agents as fairly as possible.
