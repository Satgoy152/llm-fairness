Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  18  23  58  79  46
1   9   4  79  76  55  89
2  64  25  12  76  19  85
3  89  86  97  93  30  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This can be done by examining each agent's preference for the items and distributing the items accordingly.

Given the valuations, let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values for items: [1, 18, 23, 58, 79, 46]
   - Highest valued item is 4 (79)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values for items: [9, 4, 79, 76, 55, 89]
   - Highest valued item is 5 (89)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values for items: [64, 25, 12, 76, 19, 85]
   - Highest valued item is 5 (85), but item 5 is already allocated to Agent 1.
   - Next highest valued item is 3 (76)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values for items: [89, 86, 97, 93, 30, 14]
   - Highest valued item is 2 (97)

Considering the distribution:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3

Now, for the remaining items (0 and 1):

- Agent 3 has a high value for item 0 (89), so assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Agent 3 also values item 1 highly (86), so assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Now all items are allocated. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items where they have high valuations, and all items are allocated.
