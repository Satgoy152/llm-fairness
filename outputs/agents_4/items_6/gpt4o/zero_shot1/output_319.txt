Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  34  34  39  16  80
1  44  87   5  95  88  99
2  64   8  57  24  65  86
3  98  92  15  53  62   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to consider each agent's preferences and the overall distribution of items. A fair allocation can mean that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly, so we can allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly, so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0, so we allocate item 0 to agent 3.
- We still need to allocate items 2 and 3.

Continuing with this method, let's allocate:

- Item 2 can be allocated to agent 0, who values it more than the others.
- Item 3 can be allocated to agent 1, who values it significantly.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0]
}
```
