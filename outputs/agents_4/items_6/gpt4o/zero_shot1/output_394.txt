Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  42  58  21  27  41
1  96   8  61  81  41  66
2  61  39  98  49  99  61
3  27  27  20  10  47  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 42 58 21 27 41]
 [96  8 61 81 41 66]
 [61 39 98 49 99 61]
 [27 27 20 10 47 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. One way to approach this is by assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuation for each item, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [42, 42, 58, 21, 27, 41]
Agent 1: [96, 8, 61, 81, 41, 66]
Agent 2: [61, 39, 98, 49, 99, 61]
Agent 3: [27, 27, 20, 10, 47, 81]
```

We will allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item by reallocating if necessary.

Let's go through the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
- **Item 1**: Both Agents 0 and 3 value it at 42 and 27 respectively. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 99.
- **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most at 81.

Now let's ensure each agent receives at least one item:

Currently:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [2, 4]
- Agent 3: [5]

Each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```
