Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  93  11  44  18  63
1  77  91  93  90  64   5
2  37  67  64  71  13  57
3  65   5  59  37  27  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 91 93 90 64  5]
 [37 67 64 71 13 57]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the table and allocate items:

1. For item 0, the valuations are: 
   - Agent 0: 67
   - Agent 1: 77
   - Agent 2: 37
   - Agent 3: 65
   The highest valuation is from Agent 1.

2. For item 1, the valuations are:
   - Agent 0: 93
   - Agent 1: 91
   - Agent 2: 67
   - Agent 3: 5
   The highest valuation is from Agent 0.

3. For item 2, the valuations are:
   - Agent 0: 11
   - Agent 1: 93
   - Agent 2: 64
   - Agent 3: 59
   The highest valuation is from Agent 1.

4. For item 3, the valuations are:
   - Agent 0: 44
   - Agent 1: 90
   - Agent 2: 71
   - Agent 3: 37
   The highest valuation is from Agent 1.

5. For item 4, the valuations are:
   - Agent 0: 18
   - Agent 1: 64
   - Agent 2: 13
   - Agent 3: 27
   The highest valuation is from Agent 1.

6. For item 5, the valuations are:
   - Agent 0: 63
   - Agent 1: 5
   - Agent 2: 57
   - Agent 3: 19
   The highest valuation is from Agent 0.

Now, we distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item if possible:

- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items 0, 2, 3, and 4. However, to ensure fair distribution, we assign:
  - Item 0 to Agent 1
  - Item 2 to Agent 1
  - Item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation after Agent 1)
  - Item 4 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation after Agent 1)

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 1 and 5, so we assign:
  - Item 1 to Agent 0
  - Item 5 to Agent 0

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly according to the valuations provided.
