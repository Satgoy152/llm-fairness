Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19   8  26  40  11  68
1  79  66  60  64  41  17
2  80  99  23  78  21  31
3   3  74  47  60  95  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. One common approach is to aim for a distribution that maximizes total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. However, since there are 4 agents and only 6 items, not every agent will receive an item.

Let's proceed with an allocation that aims to give each agent a fair chance based on their valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 2 and 5, with values of 26 and 68 respectively.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0 and 1, with values of 79 and 66 respectively.
3. **Agent 2** has exceptionally high valuations for items 1 and 3, with values of 99 and 78 respectively.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 4, with a value of 95.

Considering these observations, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2, but highest available after item 1 is assigned).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (since item 2 has a decent value for Agent 0, and Agent 0 would otherwise only receive one item).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and it attempts to respect the highest valuations of the agents based on the given table.
