Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  63  43   2  72  92
1  21   3  78  58  68   0
2  14  85  49  56  71  23
3  31  51  12  24  91  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. We'll look for a balanced approach that considers each agent's preferences.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [4, 63, 43, 2, 72, 92]
- Agent 1: [21, 3, 78, 58, 68, 0]
- Agent 2: [14, 85, 49, 56, 71, 23]
- Agent 3: [31, 51, 12, 24, 91, 66]

We'll proceed by attempting to allocate the items to maximize each agent's total value:

1. **Highest Valuation Strategy**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

   - Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most with 31.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most with 85.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most with 78.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most with 58.
   - Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most with 91.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with 92.

2. **Distribution**: Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items with a balanced distribution.

With the initial allocation based on the highest valuations, we have:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [2, 3]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [0, 4]

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and the total number of items equals 6.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
