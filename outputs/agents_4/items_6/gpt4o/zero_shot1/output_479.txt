Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  65  17  30  97  49
1  72  99  93  52  53  74
2  94  10  75  53  28  98
3   1  29  48  67  67   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 65 17 30 97 49]
 [72 99 93 52 53 74]
 [94 10 75 53 28 98]
 [ 1 29 48 67 67  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One possible approach is to assign items to the agents based on maximizing their individual satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest with a value of 97.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest with a value of 99.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest with a value of 98.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest with a value of 67.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Item 0 has the second highest value for Agent 2 at 94, so we assign it to Agent 2.
- Item 2 has the second highest value for Agent 1 at 93, so we assign it to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent is receiving items they value highly, and all items are assigned. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [3]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.
