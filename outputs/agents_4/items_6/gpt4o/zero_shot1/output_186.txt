Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  95  15   4  26  55
1  98  34  60  61  73  61
2  24  87  16  79   7  11
3  11  20   4  21  89  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We need to consider the different valuations agents have for each item and try to distribute the items such that the allocations are as equitable as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [99, 95, 15, 4, 26, 55]
Agent 1: [98, 34, 60, 61, 73, 61]
Agent 2: [24, 87, 16, 79, 7, 11]
Agent 3: [11, 20, 4, 21, 89, 13]
```

Now, let's proceed with allocating the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0 and 4.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 and 3 highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly.

Now, we will allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 for its highest value.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 as it values it highly, and Agent 0 already has a high-value item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as it is their highest value item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, due to high valuation and balance.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it leaves Agent 0 with a high-value item, while Agent 1 gets another item.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it balances Agent 0's allocation.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the values each agent receives based on their preferences.
