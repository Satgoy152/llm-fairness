Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  94  35  32  49  25
1  25  35  36  82  77  35
2  83  54   7  33  88  56
3   5  73  72  92  59  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 54  7 33 88 56]
 [ 5 73 72 92 59 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is for item 1 (94), but item 0 (70) is also valued well. 
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value is for item 3 (82).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value is for item 4 (88).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value is for item 3 (92), but it's already taken.
   - Next highest value is for item 2 (72).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items**: Items 0 and 5 are left.

6. **Re-evaluate Remaining Items**:
   - For item 0: 
     - Agent 2 has highest valuation (83). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
   - For item 5:
     - Agent 2 has highest valuation (56). Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 0, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while maximizing the overall valuations for each agent.
