Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  97  24  86  99  74
1  84  53  25  87  24  85
2  35  23  71  59  16  99
3  67   7  93  93   9  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 53 25 87 24 85]
 [35 23 71 59 16 99]
 [67  7 93 93  9 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, while also considering the valuations to maximize overall satisfaction. Given the requirement to allocate all 6 items, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (99), Item 1 (97), Item 3 (86)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (87), Item 0 (84), Item 5 (85)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (99), Item 2 (71), Item 3 (59)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (93), Item 3 (93), Item 0 (67)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and 2 items remain to be allocated. We should distribute the remaining items to maximize the utility for those with lower current allocations while ensuring no agent is left out if possible.

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Remaining highest value: Item 1 (97)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Remaining highest value: Item 0 (84)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

Now, all 6 items are allocated. Let's present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2]
}
```
