Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  95   2  84  61  74
1  27  88  10   4  70  39
2  13  11  61  83  39  67
3  92  15  58  62  46  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. One approach is to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their satisfaction or utility. A common method to achieve this is through a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest individual valuation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (95), so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Next highest unallocated item valuation is for item 4 (70), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Next highest unallocated item valuation is for item 2 (61), so allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Next highest unallocated item valuation is for item 0 (92), so allocate item 0 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 0** (again, since we have more items):
   - Next highest unallocated item valuation for agent 0 is item 3 (84), so allocate item 3 to agent 0.

6. **Agent 3** (again, since we have more items):
   - Next highest unallocated item valuation for agent 3 is item 5 (76), so allocate item 5 to agent 3.

Now, let's check that all items are allocated:

- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (all items are allocated)
- Total: 6 items allocated

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
