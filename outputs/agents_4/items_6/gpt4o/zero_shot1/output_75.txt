Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  33  75  51  37  42
1  41   3  88  45  88  77
2  70  53  10  16  34  44
3  79  40  51  16  63  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[80 33 75 51 37 42]
 [41  3 88 45 88 77]
 [70 53 10 16 34 44]
 [79 40 51 16 63 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, or if not possible, balance the allocations as evenly as possible.

Let's evaluate a fair allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 0 (80) and 2 (75). We can assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 2 (88) and 4 (88). Since item 2 is already assigned to Agent 0, we'll assign item 4 to Agent 1, and additionally, item 5 (77) as it's another high-value item for this agent.
3. **Agent 2** doesn't have any standout high valuations, so we can assign item 1 (53) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a relatively high valuation for item 0 (79), but since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can assign item 3 (16) to Agent 3.

Here's how the allocation could be structured:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 3

This respects the constraints of having each agent receive at least one item, or as evenly as possible, and all items being allocated.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
