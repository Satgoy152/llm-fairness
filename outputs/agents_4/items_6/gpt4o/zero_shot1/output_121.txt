Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  49   2  99  15  38
1  58  95  91   8   2   2
2  34  91  16   1  94  72
3  24  88  79   8  92   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Given there are 6 items and 4 agents, some agents will end up with more items than others.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items based on maximizing the valuation for each agent:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (99)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (95)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (94)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (88), but already taken by Agent 1
   - Next highest: Item 4 (92), but already taken by Agent 2
   - Next highest: Item 2 (79)

Now let's distribute the remaining items among the agents:

- Agent 0 has Item 3.
- Agent 1 has Item 1.
- Agent 2 has Item 4.
- Agent 3 has Item 2.

Remaining items are 0 and 5. Let's allocate these to the agents with fewer items:

- Agent 1: Item 0 (58), as Agent 1 has high valuation for this item compared to other agents.
- Agent 2: Item 5 (72), as Agent 2 has a good valuation for this item and it balances the distribution.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```
