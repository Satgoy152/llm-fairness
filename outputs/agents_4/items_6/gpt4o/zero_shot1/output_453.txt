Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  61  53   2  64  19
1  13  20  25   6  66  17
2  14  38  38  46  46  44
3  71  57  55  85   6  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or ensure fairness in distribution. One approach is to use a "max-min" fairness strategy where we try to maximize the minimum value received by any agent.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has fairly balanced valuations across items, with 46 being the highest for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5.

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest valuation of 71).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation of 61).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 53).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (highest valuation of 85).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 66).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (highest valuation of 93).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item (except Agent 2, who receives none, due to the nature of their valuations and others having higher bids). It also takes into account the highest valuations for each item to maximize individual satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
