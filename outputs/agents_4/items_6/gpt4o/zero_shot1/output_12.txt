Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  77   4   9  89  34
1  28  82  40  30  71  97
2  83  40  41  14  81   4
3  34   1  15  32  70   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A common approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring a balanced distribution. Here's one way to do it:

1. Identify the highest value each agent places on the items and assign those items first.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) to maintain fairness.

Following these steps, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (89).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (97).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (83).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (32).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 also values item 1 (77).
- Agent 1 also values item 2 (40).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated fairly according to the given valuations.
