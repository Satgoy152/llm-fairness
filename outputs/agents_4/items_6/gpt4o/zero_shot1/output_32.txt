Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  79  22  19   3  62
1  80  73  56  25  71  59
2  54  38  93  95   9  45
3  56  35  50  93  39  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 79 22 19  3 62]
 [80 73 56 25 71 59]
 [54 38 93 95  9 45]
 [56 35 50 93 39 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent can receive an integer number of items. Let's analyze the table and try to allocate the items accordingly:

The table is:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  79  22  19   3  62
1  80  73  56  25  71  59
2  54  38  93  95   9  45
3  56  35  50  93  39  13
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Identify the highest value for each item and allocate that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's allocate based on the highest valuations:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 96 by Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 79 by Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 93 by Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 71 by Agent 1.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 62 by Agent 0.

### Allocation:

Based on the above analysis, the allocation is:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 5
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 3**: No items (as all items are allocated)

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents maximizing their valuations.
