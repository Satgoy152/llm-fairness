Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86   4  33  76  76  69
1  90  25  90  27  77  50
2  66  52  71  76  72  42
3  34  49  78  84  80  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is one way to fairly distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0
   - Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 1, but we will assign it to Agent 0 because Agent 1 can still obtain high value from other items.
   
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 2 and 4
   - Agent 1 values item 2 and item 4 highly.

3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 3
   - Item 3 is valued equally by Agent 0 and Agent 2, but we will assign it to Agent 2 to balance the allocations.

4. **Agent 3**: Assign items 1 and 5
   - Agent 3 can take items 1 and 5, which are not as highly valued by other agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, all items are allocated, and the distribution is reasonably fair based on the given values.
