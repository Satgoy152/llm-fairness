Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  21  99  48  39  77
1  12  73  13  65  32  92
2  35   4   4  70  94  90
3  42  31  87  66  24  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents based on the table of valuations, we need to consider the total value each agent can get. A common approach is to ensure each agent receives a fair share or maximize the total value distributed. Given this, here is a potential allocation that tries to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (99), 0 (84)
   - Allocate items: 2, 0

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 5 (92), 3 (65)
   - Allocate items: 5, 3

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 4 (94), 3 (70)
   - Allocate items: 4 

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (87), 3 (66)
   - Allocate items: 1

To ensure that all items are allocated, let's re-evaluate given these constraints:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [5]
- Agent 2: Items [4]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 3]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the total valuation is distributed fairly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
