Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  36  81  32  95  26
1  15  51  48  78  46  22
2  27  23  13  79   9  35
3  99  52  16  37  46  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 36 81 32 95 26]
 [15 51 48 78 46 22]
 [27 23 13 79  9 35]
 [99 52 16 37 46 41]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Below is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 4 the highest, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 3 the highest, so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 3 the highest, but since item 3 is already taken, we allocate the next highest valued item, which is item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 the highest, so we allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Now we have to assign the remaining items (1 and 2) to the agents.** 
   - **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 1 who already has item 3, as they value item 1 the second highest after item 3.
   - **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 0 as they value item 2 the highest after item 4.

This allocation strategy might not be perfect, but it ensures all items are allocated and each agent gets some value. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
