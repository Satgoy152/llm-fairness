Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  83  98  40  12  54
1  93   3   4  62  50  72
2   4   6   4  53  18  13
3  89  74  61  81  44  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. One approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuations, considering the overall fairness and distribution.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued item to each agent to start with:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (98).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (93).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (53).
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (96).

2. With these assignments:
   - Items 2, 0, 3, and 5 are allocated, leaving items 1 and 4 unallocated.

3. Allocate the remaining items based on the next highest preference, ensuring no agent receives more than a fair share:
   - Item 1 can go to Agent 0 (as they have the next highest value of 83 for it).
   - Item 4 can go to Agent 1 (as they have the next highest value of 50 for it).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, with each agent receiving items in such a way that maximizes their total valuations while attempting to maintain fairness across the distribution.
