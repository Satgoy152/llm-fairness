Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  62  57  75  20  62
1  55  82  38  90  82  97
2  13  63  23   7  33  98
3   7  77  37  80  20  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 63 23  7 33 98]
 [ 7 77 37 80 20 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute them in a manner where each agent receives a fair share. Given the valuations, we can approach this by ensuring each agent gets at least one of their higher-valued items if possible.

Hereâ€™s a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 (75).
2. Agent 1: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 5 (97).
3. Agent 2: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 5, but since it's already taken by Agent 1, we consider the next highest, item 1 (63).
4. Agent 3: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 3, but since it's taken by Agent 0, we consider item 1 (77), but since it's taken, we consider item 4 (80).

After assigning the highest available valued items to each agent, we try to balance the remaining items:

5. Agent 2: Assign item 0 (13), as it is still available.
6. Agent 3: Assign item 2 (37), as it is still available.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and distributes the total of 6 items as fairly as possible based on their valuations.
