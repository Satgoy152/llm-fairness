Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  69   3  26  16  32
1  31  44  77  86  18  18
2  93  49  94  62  43  90
3  67  69  74  80  74  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. We will iterate through the agents and assign items based on the highest valuation first, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2 (94), item 5 (90), and item 0 (93). We'll assign these items to Agent 2 because they have the highest unique valuations for these items.

2. **Agent 1** values item 3 (86) highly. We'll assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 4 (74) and item 3 (80), but since item 3 is already assigned to Agent 1, we'll assign item 4 to Agent 3.

4. **Agent 0** will receive item 1 (69) since it is the highest remaining value for this agent.

To make sure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, the allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6, covering all available items.
