Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  11  56  78   4  41
1  28  11  82   9  41  34
2  87   4  83  58  26  15
3  47  47  81  20  90  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each item is assigned to an agent such that the overall allocation is balanced in terms of the agents' valuations. One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives and ensure all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and assign the items to agents:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0: 17
   - Agent 1: 28
   - Agent 2: 87
   - Agent 3: 47
   - Assign to Agent 2 (87)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0: 11
   - Agent 1: 11
   - Agent 2: 4
   - Agent 3: 47
   - Assign to Agent 3 (47)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0: 56
   - Agent 1: 82
   - Agent 2: 83
   - Agent 3: 81
   - Assign to Agent 2 (83)

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0: 78
   - Agent 1: 9
   - Agent 2: 58
   - Agent 3: 20
   - Assign to Agent 0 (78)

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0: 4
   - Agent 1: 41
   - Agent 2: 26
   - Agent 3: 90
   - Assign to Agent 3 (90)

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0: 41
   - Agent 1: 34
   - Agent 2: 15
   - Agent 3: 97
   - Assign to Agent 3 (97)

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2
- Agent 3: Items 1, 4, 5

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
