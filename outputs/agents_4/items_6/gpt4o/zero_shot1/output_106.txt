Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  95  54  29  61  66
1  75  69  92  95   0  86
2  47  89  43  24  15  45
3  25  71   7   8  30  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that maximizes each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive, based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 95. So, we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** The highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 with a value of 95. We allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 with a value of 89, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 5 with a value of 45. We allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** The highest value for Agent 3 is item 5 with a value of 95, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 1 with a value of 71, but it's also taken. The next highest is item 4 with a value of 30. We allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 2:

5. **Agent 0:** The next highest value items for Agent 0 that are available are item 0 (value 57) and item 2 (value 54). We allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all items are allocated based on the highest values available to each agent.
