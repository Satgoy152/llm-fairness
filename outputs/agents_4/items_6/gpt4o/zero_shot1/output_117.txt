Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  40  58  61  69  36
1  11  70  17  39  44  60
2  57  15  34  95  89  84
3  52  35  40  27  27  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the values each agent assigns to the items. In this scenario, one straightforward approach is to use a method that maximizes the total satisfaction of the agents. This can be done by assigning items based on the highest available valuation for each item while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Let's analyze the table:

| Agent | \ Item | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0     |        | 94| 40| 58| 61| 69| 36|
| 1     |        | 11| 70| 17| 39| 44| 60|
| 2     |        | 57| 15| 34| 95| 89| 84|
| 3     |        | 52| 35| 40| 27| 27| 77|

We will allocate the items as follows:

1. Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0 (94).
2. Item 1 is most valued by Agent 1 (70).
3. Item 2 is most valued by Agent 0 (58).
4. Item 3 is most valued by Agent 2 (95).
5. Item 4 is most valued by Agent 2 (89).
6. Item 5 is most valued by Agent 2 (84).

Agent 2 gets three items because they have the highest valuations for multiple items, and no other agent values those items as highly. Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item by adjusting if necessary:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 4, 5]
- Agent 3: No items as they have the lowest valuations for all items.

Now, the total allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4, 5],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share considering their valuations while satisfying the condition that only six items are allocated.
