Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  65  22  35  23  87
1  96  32  97  62  61  66
2  34  95  86  90   5  28
3  66  82   8  97  57  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll consider the valuations and attempt to maximize total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll use a method that considers each agent's highest-valued items, attempting to distribute them fairly.

Let's break down the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values are for items 0 (95) and 5 (87).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values are for items 2 (97) and 0 (96).
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values are for items 1 (95) and 3 (90).
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values are for items 3 (97) and 5 (86).

Based on these values, we should try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2 (97) and item 0 (96).  
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 1 (95).  
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 (97) and item 5 (86).  
- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 4 (23).

This allocation ensures that we maximize the total value based on the highest preferences while distributing all items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed with respect to the agents' highest valuations.
