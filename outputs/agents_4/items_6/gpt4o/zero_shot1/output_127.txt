Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  36  85   3  53  56
1  80  41  47  81  55  36
2  69   2  42  47  10   5
3  85  66   6  94  83  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy where we try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We'll consider each agent's preferences and attempt to distribute the items accordingly. Let's go through the process:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 2, and 5.
2. Agent 1 values items 0, 3, and 4 highly.
3. Agent 2 has a relatively high value for item 0.
4. Agent 3 highly values items 0, 3, and 4.

To ensure fairness, we can try to allocate items by considering the highest available value for each agent and ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0: 0 (value: 52)
- Agent 1: 3 (value: 81)
- Agent 2: 2 (value: 42)
- Agent 3: 1 (value: 66)
- Remaining items are 4 and 5. We distribute these to maximize overall satisfaction:
  - Agent 0 can also take item 5 (value: 56)
  - Agent 3 takes item 4 (value: 83)

Therefore, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, with the distribution considering the highest possible values for each agent.
