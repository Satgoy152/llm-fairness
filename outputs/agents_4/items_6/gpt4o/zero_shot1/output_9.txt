Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  17  48  20  56  46
1   0  57   7  58   6  26
2  53  21  92  46  68  14
3  62  64  76  28  48  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider different strategies such as maximizing total value, ensuring balanced distribution, or other fairness criteria. For simplicity, let's try to maximize the total value by assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

We will allocate the items by considering the highest value each agent places on the items, making sure that each agent receives at least one item if possible. After examining the valuations, we will assign the items as follows:

1. For Agent 0, we allocate the item with the highest valuation, which is item 0 (value = 99).
2. For Agent 1, the item with the highest valuation is item 3 (value = 58).
3. For Agent 2, we assign item 2 (value = 92).
4. For Agent 3, the highest valued item is item 2 (value = 76), but since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 2, we allocate item 1 (value = 64).

Now, allocate the remaining items to ensure each agent gets at least one item while considering their next highest valuations:

5. Agent 0 has item 4 as the next highest value (value = 56).
6. Agent 1 has item 5 as the next highest value (value = 26).

Agent 3 will receive item 3, as it has not been allocated yet, and this is their next highest value after item 1.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, taking into account the agents' highest valuations while giving each agent a fair share of items.
