Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  56   1  32  11  51
1  89   0   9  88  15  18
2  11  11  91  27  67  20
3  15  59  35  14  68  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed, we can aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives based on their valuations. Here is one possible allocation:

1. First, let's consider each agent's highest-valued items to prioritize their preferences. 
2. Then, we can assign the items to the agents while ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Based on the valuations given, here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 97. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 89, but it's already taken by Agent 0. The next highest value is item 3 with a valuation of 88. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 91. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most with a valuation of 68. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

For the remaining items (1 and 5), let's allocate them to maximize remaining value:

- Item 1: Agent 3 values item 1 at 59, which is the highest remaining value. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values item 5 at 51, which is the highest remaining value. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on the valuations provided, and all items are distributed among the agents.
