Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  35  94  74  66  33
1  22   0  92  30  74  36
2  32  50  19  81  72  58
3  46   8  84  33  41   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This involves solving a type of assignment problem. Let's go through the process:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent:** We need to find a way to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (value) is maximized for each agent.

2. **Assign items based on preference and availability:** We'll look at the highest values and assign items one by one, ensuring that each item goes to the agent who values it the most but also ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated:** We need to make sure that exactly 6 items are allocated in total.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest values: Item 0 (96), Item 2 (94)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest values: Item 2 (92), Item 4 (74)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest values: Item 3 (81), Item 4 (72)

- **Agent 3:**
  - Highest values: Item 2 (84), Item 0 (46)

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Give **Agent 0** item 0, as they have the highest value for it.
2. Give **Agent 1** item 4, as they value it highly and item 2 is already considered for others.
3. Give **Agent 2** item 3, which is their highest value item.
4. Give **Agent 3** item 2, as it is their highest remaining valued item.

Now, re-evaluate the remaining items:

- **Remaining items:** 1, 5
- **Agents without items yet:** None, but we can assign leftover items to maximize remaining values.

5. **Agent 0** gets item 1 (value 35), as they have no other allocations and it's a reasonable choice.
6. **Agent 2** gets item 5 (value 58), maximizing their remaining value options.

The allocation should ensure each agent gets their fair share based on their valuations. Thus, the JSON allocation representation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent gets a fair share based on the highest values they placed on the items.
