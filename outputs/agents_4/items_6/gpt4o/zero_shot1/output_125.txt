Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  59  91  19  31  62
1  32   8  33  36  56  22
2  87  11  64  34  41  77
3  93  75   9  47  81  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can use a method that aims to balance these values across all agents. 

Let's try to allocate items in a way that each agent receives a fair share based on the values provided:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 5. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for item 4. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0 and 5. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0 and 3. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

5. **Item 1**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation, so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
6. **Item 3**: Agent 1 has a relatively higher valuation for this item compared to other unallocated items, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, each agent has received a fair allocation considering their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, based on their preferences.
