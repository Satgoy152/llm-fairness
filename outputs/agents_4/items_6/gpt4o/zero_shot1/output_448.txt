Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  54  79  18  86  55
1  59  68  36  89  90  97
2  78  31  71  34  63  56
3  87  13  67  84  85  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 4 agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that ensures each agent is as satisfied as possible with the items they receive. One way to achieve this is by using a "maximum sum" approach, where items are allocated to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than necessary.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (61), Agent 1 (59), Agent 2 (78), Agent 3 (87)
   - Allocate to Agent 3 (highest valuation).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (54), Agent 1 (68), Agent 2 (31), Agent 3 (13)
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (79), Agent 1 (36), Agent 2 (71), Agent 3 (67)
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (18), Agent 1 (89), Agent 2 (34), Agent 3 (84)
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (86), Agent 1 (90), Agent 2 (63), Agent 3 (85)
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (55), Agent 1 (97), Agent 2 (56), Agent 3 (66)
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

Now, let's ensure a fair distribution of items. Currently, Agent 1 has four items, which exceeds what is fair given there are only 6 items and 4 agents. We'll reallocate to improve fairness:

- Reallocate Item 4 to Agent 3 (second highest valuation).
- Reallocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 1, Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 0, Item 4

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
