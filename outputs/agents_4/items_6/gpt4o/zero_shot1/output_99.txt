Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  72  16  20  20  96
1  88  87  47  98  37  33
2  61  67  80   1  64  65
3  65  33  41  79   2  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 87 47 98 37 33]
 [61 67 80  1 64 65]
 [65 33 41 79  2 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent. One common approach is to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation by considering their highest valuations.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations**: 
   - Item 5 (96)
   - Item 1 (72)

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations**:
   - Item 3 (98)
   - Item 0 (88)

3. **Agent 2's highest valuations**:
   - Item 2 (80)

4. **Agent 3's highest valuations**:
   - Item 3 (79)

Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and only 6 items are to be allocated, we'll distribute the items in a way that attempts to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent, while ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

Here is a fair allocation based on the valuations:

- Agent 0: Gets items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1: Gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2: Gets item 2.
- Agent 3: Gets item 4.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 6.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
