Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  77  35  96  31  52
1  34  38  15  32  14   2
2  41  92  51  55  94  97
3  39  42  38  21  18  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 3 (value 96).
  
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 0 (value 34).
  
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 5 (value 97).
  
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item for Agent 3 is item 1 (value 42).
  
Now, let's allocate the remaining items in a way that continues to maximize satisfaction:

- Remaining unallocated items: 2 and 4.

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 1 (value 77), but it's already allocated. 
   - Next available highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 35).

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Next available highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 4 (value 14).

Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total allocation of items equals the number of items available (6 items in total).
