Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  84  65  22  82  11
1  61  62  71  60  27   9
2  39  18  17  98   9  12
3   1  80  87  41  64  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for each item. A common approach is to try and maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent. Here's one possible allocation based on maximizing individual valuations while ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 1 (value 84) is the highest value for Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 (value 71) is the highest value for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 3 (value 98) is the highest value for Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 0 (value 68) is the second-highest value for Agent 3, after item 1 which is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Item 4 (value 64) is the second-highest value for Agent 3, after item 2 which is already taken by Agent 1.

Assigning the remaining item (Item 5):

- Agent 1 has a low value for Item 5, but it balances the distribution of items across agents better than other allocations.

Therefore, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to respect their highest preferences based on the given valuations.
