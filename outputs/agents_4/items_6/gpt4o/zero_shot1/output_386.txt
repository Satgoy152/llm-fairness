Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  51  54  57  68  57
1  59  18  38  88  95  77
2  43   6  21  96  79  89
3  63  86  75  76  90  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[39 51 54 57 68 57]
 [59 18 38 88 95 77]
 [43  6 21 96 79 89]
 [63 86 75 76 90 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the valuations each agent gets while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  51  54  57  68  57
1  59  18  38  88  95  77
2  43   6  21  96  79  89
3  63  86  75  76  90  12
```

We can try to assign items in a way that each agent receives the items that have the highest value to them, ensuring fairness. Let's analyze the valuations and assign items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 4 (68) and 3 (57).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values are for items 4 (95) and 3 (88).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values are for items 3 (96), 5 (89), and 4 (79).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest values are for items 1 (86), 4 (90), and 3 (76).

To allocate fairly, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and items are distributed according to the highest preference:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (95), as it has the highest value.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (96), as it has the highest value.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (86), as it has the highest value.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (39), as it has the highest value among remaining items.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (89), next highest value for Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (54), remaining item for Agent 0.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation based on the constraints.
