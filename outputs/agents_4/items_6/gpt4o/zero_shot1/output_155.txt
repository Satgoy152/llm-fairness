Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  20  57  48   9  35
1  84  47  67  48  66  71
2  85  22   4  34  48   0
3  38  32  48  15  39  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [85 22  4 34 48  0]
 [38 32 48 15 39 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 should be assigned items where they have relatively higher valuations compared to others.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for item 0 and item 5.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0, so it should be prioritized for agent 2.
- Agent 3 has higher valuations for items that are less valued by others.

Let's allocate based on these considerations:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (85).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (20), but Agent 1 has a higher overall total valuation, so it can be given to Agent 1 (47).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (67).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is shared by Agents 0 and 1 (48). We'll assign it to Agent 0, who has fewer items so far.
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (66).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (71).

Based on these allocations, here is the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation considers both the highest valuations and the need to distribute items fairly among the agents while ensuring all items are allocated.
