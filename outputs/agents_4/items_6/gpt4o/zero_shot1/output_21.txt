Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  87  22  76  50  54
1  38  69  57  37  83  57
2  59  26  58  65  66   8
3  89  36  80  17  49  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 6 items are allocated. One common method is to use a "greedy" algorithm, where each item is given to the agent who values it most, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

Let's analyze the given table and allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0: 78
   - Agent 1: 38
   - Agent 2: 59
   - Agent 3: 89 -> Allocate to Agent 3

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0: 87 -> Allocate to Agent 0
   - Agent 1: 69
   - Agent 2: 26
   - Agent 3: 36

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0: 22
   - Agent 1: 57 -> Allocate to Agent 1
   - Agent 2: 58
   - Agent 3: 80

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0: 76
   - Agent 1: 37
   - Agent 2: 65
   - Agent 3: 17 -> Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0: 50
   - Agent 1: 83 -> Allocate to Agent 1
   - Agent 2: 66
   - Agent 3: 49

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0: 54
   - Agent 1: 57
   - Agent 2: 8
   - Agent 3: 75 -> Allocate to Agent 3

After allocation, we have:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 0, 5

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
