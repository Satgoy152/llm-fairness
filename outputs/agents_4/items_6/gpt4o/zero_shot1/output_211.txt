Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  92  41  63  67  32
1  80  89  71  55  27  17
2  80  88  99  27  84  81
3  96  63  25  78  53  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 92 41 63 67 32]
 [80 89 71 55 27 17]
 [80 88 99 27 84 81]
 [96 63 25 78 53 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (92).
   - Next highest is item 0 (70).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (80) - already allocated to agent 0.
   - Next highest is item 1 (89) - already allocated to agent 0.
   - Next highest is item 2 (71).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (99) - already allocated to agent 1.
   - Next highest is item 5 (81).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (96) - already allocated to agent 0.
   - Next highest is item 5 (92) - already allocated to agent 2.
   - Next highest is item 3 (78).

5. After assigning these high-value items, we have items 4 remaining.
   - Item 4 is assigned to Agent 2 since it has a relatively high valuation (84) for Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and attempts to maximize the satisfaction of agents based on their valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
