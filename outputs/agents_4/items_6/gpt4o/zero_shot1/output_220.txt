Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94   8  12  79   8  44
1   6  61  91  56   3  48
2  81  31  54  80  67  12
3   9  12  47  20  59  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94  8 12 79  8 44]
 [ 6 61 91 56  3 48]
 [81 31 54 80 67 12]
 [ 9 12 47 20 59 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's assign item 0 to agent 0 since it has the highest valuation of 94 among all agents for that item.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 2 to agent 1, as it has the highest valuation of 91.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 to agent 2, with a high value of 80.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 to agent 3, as it has a significant valuation of 59.

Now, we have allocated four items, and two are left to be allocated. Let's evaluate the remaining items:

5. **Agent 2**: Let's assign item 1 to agent 2, as it has the second highest valuation of 31 among the remaining items.
6. **Agent 0**: Finally, assign item 5 to agent 0, given it still has a considerable valuation of 44.

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item. Let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
