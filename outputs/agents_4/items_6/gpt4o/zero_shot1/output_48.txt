Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  29  91   6  50  66
1  82  49  45  13  67   3
2  32  72  67  56  73  95
3  96  28  29  94  16  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[17 29 91  6 50 66]
 [82 49 45 13 67  3]
 [32 72 67 56 73 95]
 [96 28 29 94 16 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent has an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [17, 29, 91, 6, 50, 66]
Agent 1: [82, 49, 45, 13, 67, 3]
Agent 2: [32, 72, 67, 56, 73, 95]
Agent 3: [96, 28, 29, 94, 16, 62]
```

To maximize fairness, we can try to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuations, while ensuring all 6 items are given out. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 2 (value 91) and item 5 (value 66).
2. Agent 1 receives item 0 (value 82).
3. Agent 2 receives item 4 (value 73).
4. Agent 3 receives item 3 (value 94) and item 1 (value 28).

This allocation considers each agent's highest valuations while distributing all 6 items. Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```
