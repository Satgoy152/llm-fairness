Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  40  95  14  94  29
1  31  29  89  75  82  19
2  71  34  94  48  96  32
3  59  56  56  82  13   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 34 94 48 96 32]
 [59 56 56 82 13  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider some potential allocation strategies:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuations on items: 2 (95), 4 (94)
   - Allocating items [2, 4] to Agent 0 gives a total valuation of 189.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations on items: 2 (89), 3 (75)
   - However, item 2 is better allocated to Agent 0.
   - Allocating item [3] to Agent 1 gives a total valuation of 75.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations on items: 4 (96), 2 (94)
   - However, both items are better allocated to Agent 0.
   - Allocating item [0] to Agent 2 gives a total valuation of 71.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations on items: 3 (82), 0 (59)
   - Allocating items [1, 5] to Agent 3 gives a total valuation of 64.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair chance at high-value items relative to their preferences while maximizing the total valuation each agent can achieve given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation provides a balance between fairness and maximizing agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.
