Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  65  35  66  52  96
1  79  40  33  26  27  41
2  94  89  14  44  45  88
3  29  29   1  84  61  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 65 35 66 52 96]
 [79 40 33 26 27 41]
 [94 89 14 44 45 88]
 [29 29  1 84 61 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. Identify the highest value for each item across all agents and consider assigning the item to that agent.
2. Ensure each agent has an integer number of items, and adjust if necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 94.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 89.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 35.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 84.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it highly at 52.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 96.

After initial allocation based on highest value, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 5
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: Item 3

This allocation is fair in terms of maximizing the value each agent gets based on their preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3]
}
```
