Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  31  49  66  51  79
1  85  82  50  40   2  56
2  41  37  97   9  47  74
3  24  62  55  48  70  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that the total allocation is fair and all items are distributed.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (93), Item 5 (79), Item 3 (66)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (85), Item 1 (82), Item 5 (56)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (97), Item 5 (74), Item 0 (41)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (70), Item 1 (62), Item 5 (63)

Given these preferences, let's attempt a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets Item 0 because it has the highest value for them.
- **Agent 1** gets Item 1 because it has a high value for them, and no other agent values it as highly.
- **Agent 2** gets Item 2 because it is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 3** gets Item 4 because it is their highest valued remaining item.
- We need to allocate two more items: 
  - **Agent 0** can get Item 3, as it is one of their higher valued items.
  - **Agent 1** can get Item 5, as it still has a relatively high value for them.

Thus, the allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and ensures all items are distributed.
