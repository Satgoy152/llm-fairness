Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  41  38  47  97  87
1  88  58  23  52  85  96
2  77  69  15  36  54  88
3  29  24  94  78  71  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's review the valuations to determine the best allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value is 88 (Agent 1)
- Item 1: Highest value is 69 (Agent 2)
- Item 2: Highest value is 94 (Agent 3)
- Item 3: Highest value is 78 (Agent 3)
- Item 4: Highest value is 97 (Agent 0)
- Item 5: Highest value is 96 (Agent 1)

Here's one possible allocation based on these values, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 2, 3

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and the items are distributed according to high valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
