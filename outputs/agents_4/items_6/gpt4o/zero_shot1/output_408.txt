Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  72  19  20   1  90
1  37  21   3   4  11  68
2  41  27  49   1  65  43
3  97  59  84  28   0  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 72 19 20  1 90]
 [37 21  3  4 11 68]
 [41 27 49  1 65 43]
 [97 59 84 28  0 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. We'll consider the highest value each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items accordingly, trying to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (90), followed by item 1 (72).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (68).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (65), followed by item 2 (49).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (97), followed by item 2 (84).

Considering the above preferences, we can make the following allocations:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest value of 90).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value of 97).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (second highest value of 84).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value of 65).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest value of 72).
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (as it is the least valued item and agent 1 needs an item).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets items based on their highest valuations, providing a fair allocation based on the available data.
