Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  90  86  47  21  62
1   9  31  61  65  80  12
2  57  89  71  64  81  32
3  17  60   9  28  23  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value perceived by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum up the values each agent assigns to all items.

   - Agent 0: 27 + 90 + 86 + 47 + 21 + 62 = 333
   - Agent 1: 9 + 31 + 61 + 65 + 80 + 12 = 258
   - Agent 2: 57 + 89 + 71 + 64 + 81 + 32 = 394
   - Agent 3: 17 + 60 + 9 + 28 + 23 + 41 = 178

2. **Allocate Items Based on Preferences**: Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent one by one in a round-robin fashion, ensuring every agent gets at least one item.

3. **Assignment Process**:
   - Agent 0: Highest value for items - 1 (90), 2 (86)
   - Agent 1: Highest value for items - 4 (80)
   - Agent 2: Highest value for items - 4 (81), 1 (89)
   - Agent 3: Highest value for items - 1 (60), 5 (41)

4. **Adjust Assignments to Ensure Fair Distribution**:
   - Since each agent must have at least one item, adjust the allocations appropriately to balance the number of items each agent receives.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Allocate items 1 and 2
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 3
   - Agent 2: Allocate item 4
   - Agent 3: Allocate item 5
   - Reallocating item 0 to Agent 2 to ensure all items are allocated

Given these allocations, the final JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items is six.
