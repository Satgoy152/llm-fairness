Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54   2  76  30  19  26
1  98  33  95  23  63  99
2  63  60  56  15  25  41
3  49  60  72  95  33  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall value for each agent. We will attempt to allocate items to agents that value them the most while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Value for item 2 is 76 (highest remaining unallocated value for Agent 0). 
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Value for item 5 is 99 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Value for item 0 is 63 (highest remaining unallocated value for Agent 2). 
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Value for item 3 is 95 (highest value for Agent 3).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

This leaves items 1 and 4 unallocated.

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Value for item 4 is 63 (highest remaining unallocated value for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 0**:
   - Value for item 1 is 2 (the only remaining unallocated item). 
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, all items are allocated. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3]
}
```
