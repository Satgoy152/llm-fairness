Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  26  48  40  37  36
1   4  87  38   4  70  36
2  58  42  58  81  98  72
3  29  43  85  14  77  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing the value each agent receives based on their preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest value each agent assigns to an item**:  
   - Agent 0: Highest value is 48 for item 2.
   - Agent 1: Highest value is 87 for item 1.
   - Agent 2: Highest value is 98 for item 4.
   - Agent 3: Highest value is 85 for item 2.

2. **Allocate items based on the highest value preference**:
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 87).
   - Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 98).
   - Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 48).

3. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Items 0, 3, 5 remain.

4. **Consider remaining agents and items**:
   - Agent 3 has not received any item yet.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 since they also value it (value 72).
   - Agent 3 can take item 3 (value 14).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 12).

5. **Check the allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 2
   - Agent 1: Item 1
   - Agent 2: Items 4, 5
   - Agent 3: Item 3

6. **Ensure all items are allocated and each agent is considered**.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents fairly based on their preferences, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
