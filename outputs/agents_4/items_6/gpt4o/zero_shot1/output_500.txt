Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  32  45  76  39  63
1  50  88  83  55  41  92
2  26  25  74  69  63  55
3   3  65  35  60  17   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 32 45 76 39 63]
 [50 88 83 55 41 92]
 [26 25 74 69 63 55]
 [ 3 65 35 60 17  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Let's consider the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 1 at 50, Agent 2 at 26, and Agent 3 at 3.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 at 88, Agent 2 at 25, and Agent 3 at 65.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 at 83, Agent 2 at 74, and Agent 3 at 35.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 55, Agent 2 at 69, and Agent 3 at 60.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 at 41, Agent 2 at 63, and Agent 3 at 17.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 at 92, Agent 2 at 55, and Agent 3 at 9.

To maximize total satisfaction, we assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0 is assigned to Agent 0 (value 94).
- Item 1 is assigned to Agent 1 (value 88).
- Item 2 is assigned to Agent 1 (value 83).
- Item 3 is assigned to Agent 0 (value 76).
- Item 4 is assigned to Agent 2 (value 63).
- Item 5 is assigned to Agent 1 (value 92).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": []
}
```
