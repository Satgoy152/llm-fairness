Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  25  62  93  59  39
1  93  68  30   8  10  54
2   9  50  85  91  91  24
3  33  21  77  95  77  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 25 62 93 59 39]
 [93 68 30  8 10 54]
 [ 9 50 85 91 91 24]
 [33 21 77 95 77 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. We will use a greedy approach to achieve this.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most.

We will select items based on the highest valuations first and ensure that each agent gets at least one item.

Allocation steps:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Assign item 0 (value 98 for Agent 0)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign item 1 (value 68 for Agent 1)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign item 2 (value 85 for Agent 2)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Assign item 3 (value 95 for Agent 3)

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We will now allocate the remaining 2 items, trying to balance the overall satisfaction:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign item 4 (value 59 for Agent 0)

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign item 5 (value 54 for Agent 1)

This ensures all items are allocated and that each agent receives at least one item. 

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3]
}
```
