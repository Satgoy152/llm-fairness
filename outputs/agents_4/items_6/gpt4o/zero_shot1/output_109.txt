Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  60  88  23  12  91
1  54  69  74  65  38   4
2  43   9   3  82  80  21
3  32  84  73   2  66  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[20 60 88 23 12 91]
 [54 69 74 65 38  4]
 [43  9  3 82 80 21]
 [32 84 73  2 66 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations for the items. Given that there are 4 agents and 6 items, each agent should receive at least one item. One approach is to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 with a value of 91.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 with a value of 74.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 with a value of 82.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 with a value of 84.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, one to each agent. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items.

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 0 and 4 are still available.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation of 54).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation of 80).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 0
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 1

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1]
}
```
