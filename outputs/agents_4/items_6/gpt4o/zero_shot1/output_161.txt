Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  99  99  81  61  54
1  21  96  60  29  37  63
2  78   8  41  70  57  19
3  77  76  93  43  72  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use a method that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values items 1 and 2 the highest (both 99). We can allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Since item 1 is already allocated, the next highest value for Agent 1 is item 0 (21), followed by item 5 (63). We can allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest remaining value for Agent 2 is item 0 (78). We allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest remaining value for Agent 3 is item 2 (93). We allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 3 and 4:

5. **Allocate item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 81
   - Agent 1 values it at 29
   - Agent 2 values it at 70
   - Agent 3 values it at 43
   
   Item 3 is best allocated to Agent 0 (81).

6. **Allocate item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 61
   - Agent 1 values it at 37
   - Agent 2 values it at 57
   - Agent 3 values it at 72
   
   Item 4 is best allocated to Agent 3 (72).

The allocation is complete. Each agent has received at least one item, and all items have been allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
