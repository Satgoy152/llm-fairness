Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  35  25  10  62  43
1  28  65  88  86   2  97
2  78  45  67  80  76  24
3  77  70  58  68  38  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least a reasonable share. There are several approaches to achieve this, such as maximizing total valuation, ensuring each agent gets their most valued item, or balancing allocations by distributing items to achieve a relatively fair total valuation for each agent.

Here's one possible allocation that could be considered fair based on maximizing each agent's valuation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (62).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (97).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (80).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (77).

After assigning these items, we still have two items left: item 1 and item 2. Let's allocate these based on remaining potential satisfaction:

- Agent 2 also values item 2 quite highly (67), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 next after item 0 and item 3 (70), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

This way, each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction based on the given preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations.
