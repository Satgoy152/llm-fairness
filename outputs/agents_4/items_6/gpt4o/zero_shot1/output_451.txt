Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  16  12  24  50  55
1  20  49  33  96  11  86
2  21  36  99  36  17  23
3  95  46  82  18  64  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 16 12 24 50 55]
 [20 49 33 96 11 86]
 [21 36 99 36 17 23]
 [95 46 82 18 64 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider both the valuations and the number of items each agent receives. We need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Let's begin by analyzing the table of valuations to make an allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - High valuation items: Item 0 (63), Item 5 (55), Item 4 (50)
   - Let's allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - High valuation items: Item 3 (96), Item 5 (86)
   - Let's allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - High valuation items: Item 2 (99)
   - Let's allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - High valuation items: Item 0 (95), Item 2 (82), Item 4 (64)
   - Let's allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. Two more items need to be allocated.

5. **Remaining Items:** 
   - Items remaining: Item 1, Item 5

- For Item 1:
  - The highest remaining valuation is for Agent 1 at 49.
  - Let's allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

- For Item 5:
  - The highest remaining valuation is for Agent 1 at 86.
  - Let's allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.

Let's confirm the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 3, 1, 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 4

Now, we have allocated all 6 items fairly based on the valuations.

Here are the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4]
}
```
