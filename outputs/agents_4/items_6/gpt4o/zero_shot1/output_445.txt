Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  62  38  98  56  97
1  18  69  69  47  91  54
2  83  76  46  83  74  71
3  51  18  64  83   0   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 69 69 47 91 54]
 [83 76 46 83 74 71]
 [51 18 64 83  0  8]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can look at each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as equitable as possible. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 52 + 62 + 38 + 98 + 56 + 97 = 403
- Agent 1: 18 + 69 + 69 + 47 + 91 + 54 = 348
- Agent 2: 83 + 76 + 46 + 83 + 74 + 71 = 433
- Agent 3: 51 + 18 + 64 + 83 + 0 + 8 = 224

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 2 values item 0 highly (83) and should get it.
2. Agent 0 values item 3 highly (98) and should get it.
3. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (91) and should get it.
4. Agent 0 also values item 5 highly (97) and should get it.
5. Agent 3 values item 2 highly (64) and should get it.
6. Finally, Agent 1 values item 1 highly (69) and should get it.

This allocation ensures that all agents receive at least one item and tries to balance their total received valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2]
}
```
