Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55   9  57  15   7  25
1  19   5  31   8   4  14
2   5  45  75  97  83  93
3  11  87  52  68  74  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 55
   - Agent 1 values it at 19
   - Agent 2 values it at 5
   - Agent 3 values it at 11
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 5
   - Agent 2 values it at 45
   - Agent 3 values it at 87
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (highest value)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 57
   - Agent 1 values it at 31
   - Agent 2 values it at 75
   - Agent 3 values it at 52
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 15
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   - Agent 3 values it at 68
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 7
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Agent 2 values it at 83
   - Agent 3 values it at 74
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 25
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 93
   - Agent 3 values it at 75
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 5],
    "3": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets a number of items based on their highest valuations, ensuring fairness by maximizing the total value for each agent.
