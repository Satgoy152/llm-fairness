Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  27  67  78  51  77
1  51  42  44  18  84  28
2  23  56  15  93  84  95
3  55  38  38  56  46  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 5 27 67 78 51 77]
 [51 42 44 18 84 28]
 [23 56 15 93 84 95]
 [55 38 38 56 46 12]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to use a strategy where each agent receives the items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would have if they received each item individually.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

Let's look at the table again and allocate items to agents based on their valuations:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 5
  - Agent 1 values it at 51
  - Agent 2 values it at 23
  - Agent 3 values it at 55
  - Best value: Agent 3

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 27
  - Agent 1 values it at 42
  - Agent 2 values it at 56
  - Agent 3 values it at 38
  - Best value: Agent 2

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 67
  - Agent 1 values it at 44
  - Agent 2 values it at 15
  - Agent 3 values it at 38
  - Best value: Agent 0

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 78
  - Agent 1 values it at 18
  - Agent 2 values it at 93
  - Agent 3 values it at 56
  - Best value: Agent 2

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 51
  - Agent 1 values it at 84
  - Agent 2 values it at 84
  - Agent 3 values it at 46
  - Best value: Agent 1

- Item 5:
  - Agent 0 values it at 77
  - Agent 1 values it at 28
  - Agent 2 values it at 95
  - Agent 3 values it at 12
  - Best value: Agent 2

Allocating the items based on the highest valuations we get:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 4.
- Agent 2 receives Items 1, 3, and 5.
- Agent 3 receives Item 0.

Hence, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3, 5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
