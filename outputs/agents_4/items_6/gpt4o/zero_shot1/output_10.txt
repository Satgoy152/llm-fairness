Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  53  55  67  38  41
1  19  55  55  39  73  29
2   7  27  89  44  28  56
3  78  80  27  69  87  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item and the total valuation (or happiness) is maximized across all agents.

Let's first summarize the highest valuations each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0: Highest valuations are for items 3 (67), 2 (55), and 1 (53).
- Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 4 (73), 1 (55), and 2 (55).
- Agent 2: Highest valuations are for items 2 (89), 5 (56), and 3 (44).
- Agent 3: Highest valuations are for items 4 (87), 1 (80), and 0 (78).

Based on these valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (67) as it has the highest value for Agent 0 compared to other items.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 (73) as it has the highest value for Agent 1 compared to other items.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (89) as it has the highest value for Agent 2 compared to other items.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 1 (80) as it has the highest value for Agent 3 compared to other items.

Now we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items considering the next highest valuations:

5. **Agent 3**: Assign item 0 (78) as it is the next highest value for Agent 3.
6. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (56) as it is the next highest value for Agent 2.

Now all 6 items have been allocated.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```
