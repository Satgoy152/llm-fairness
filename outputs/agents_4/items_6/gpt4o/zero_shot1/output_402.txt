Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  43  82  76  53  18
1   3  50  69  85  53  76
2  36  11  29  54  94   4
3  52  12  86  50  10  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 43 82 76 53 18]
 [ 3 50 69 85 53 76]
 [36 11 29 54 94  4]
 [52 12 86 50 10 55]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method such as maximizing the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations, we can try to distribute the items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and make reasonable allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3: 71, 82, and 76 respectively.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 3: 85.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 highly: 94.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 highly: 86.

Based on this analysis, a possible allocation that tries to balance the total value for each agent could be:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
