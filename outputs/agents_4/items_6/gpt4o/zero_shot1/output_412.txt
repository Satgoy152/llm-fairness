Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  16  33  55  19  69
1   1  75  73  17  97  70
2  90  58  66  78  27  49
3  66  30  66   9  99  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation approach:

1. First, let's list each agent's highest valued items to prioritize allocations:
   - Agent 0: 84 (item 0), 69 (item 5), 55 (item 3)
   - Agent 1: 97 (item 4), 75 (item 1), 73 (item 2)
   - Agent 2: 90 (item 0), 78 (item 3), 66 (item 2)
   - Agent 3: 99 (item 4), 66 (item 2 and 0)

2. Allocate items starting with the highest value for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated to multiple agents.

3. Based on the table, here is a potential allocation:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 90), as it's their highest value and slightly higher than Agent 0's valuation.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 99), which provides the maximum value for any agent.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 75), their second-highest item, ensuring Agent 1 gets a high-value item.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 69), the next highest value for Agent 0 after item 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 73), as it's a high value for Agent 1 and less prioritized by others.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 78), their second-highest value item.

4. Now, each agent should have some items, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed based on the given valuations.
