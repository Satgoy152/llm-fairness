Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  58  97  86  42  55
1  65   3   0  26   4  71
2  74  81  10   3  29  94
3  19  46  17   4  89  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Given there are 6 items and 4 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 2, 0, and 3.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 5, 0, and 3.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 5, 1, and 0.
   - Since item 5 is taken, allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 4, 5, and 1.
   - Since items 5 and 1 are taken, allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, we have two items left (0 and 3) and each agent has received one item. Let's allocate the remaining items:

5. **Remaining items 0 and 3**:
   - Item 0 has high value for Agent 0 (90) and Agent 1 (65). Since Agent 0 has the highest value for it, allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Item 3 has high value for Agent 0 (86) and Agent 1 (26). Since Agent 0 has the highest value for it and has received two items, we could consider Agent 1 for this allocation. However, Agent 0's valuation is significantly higher, so let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the maximum total value is distributed fairly among the agents given their individual preferences.
