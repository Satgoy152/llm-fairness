Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  37   2  79  35   2
1   8  16  95   0  56  51
2  10  68  40  88  61   9
3  86  42  97  45  22   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 68 40 88 61  9]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their assigned items, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent and every agent gets at least one item where possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: 3 (79), 0 (51)
   - Assign items 3 and 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: 2 (95)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: 3 (88) already taken, next highest 4 (61)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 2 (97) already taken, next highest 0 (86)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (as it's the next best available).

5. Remaining items: 1

Now, let's check if all items are allocated and confirm the assignments:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Remaining item: 1

**Final allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```

All 6 items are allocated, and each agent has received items based on their highest valuations.
