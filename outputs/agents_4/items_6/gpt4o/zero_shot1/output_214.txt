Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  53  90  68  85  51
1  30   6  83  30  94  44
2  10  60  95  73  43  14
3  95  74  46  36  74  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A common approach is to use a method such as the "maximum sum of valuations" or "maximum happiness" to determine the allocation.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items with values: [28, 53, 90, 68, 85, 51]
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (value 90)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items with values: [30, 6, 83, 30, 94, 44]
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (value 94)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items with values: [10, 60, 95, 73, 43, 14]
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (value 95), but already taken by Agent 0
   - Next highest valuation: Item 3 (value 73)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items with values: [95, 74, 46, 36, 74, 17]
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value 95)

After ensuring each agent receives at least one item based on their highest available valuation:

- Allocate remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction:
  - Agent 0 can get item 5 (value 51)
  - Agent 1 can get item 1 (value 6)
  - Agent 2 can get item 4 (value 43)

Thus, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
