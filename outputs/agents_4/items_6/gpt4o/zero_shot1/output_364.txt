Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  82  18  53  87  95
1  59   1  63  53   9  42
2  55  19  92  59  50  62
3  31  87  46   9  94  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[47 82 18 53 87 95]
 [59  1 63 53  9 42]
 [55 19 92 59 50 62]
 [31 87 46  9 94 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 4 agents and 6 items, not every agent will receive an item, and some agents might receive more than one.

Let's analyze the valuation table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 with value 95.
   - Second highest valuation: Item 4 with value 87.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 with value 63.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 with value 92 (already allocated to Agent 1).
   - Next highest valuation: Item 5 with value 62 (already allocated to Agent 0).
   - Next highest valuation: Item 3 with value 59.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 with value 94 (already allocated to Agent 0).
   - Next highest valuation: Item 1 with value 87.

Given these valuations, we can formulate a fair allocation strategy:

- Allocate highly valued items to agents who value them most, while ensuring each item is only allocated once.

### Allocation Plan:
- **Agent 0:** Items 4, 5
- **Agent 1:** Item 2
- **Agent 2:** Item 3
- **Agent 3:** Item 1
- Item 0 is unallocated, so we need to allocate it as well. Since Agent 0 values item 0 the most among agents, it makes sense to assign it to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1]
}
```
