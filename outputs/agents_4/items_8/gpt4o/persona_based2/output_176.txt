Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  30  84  55  40   1  76   1
1  64  38  56  65   3  98  68  12
2  21  82  17  82  74  13  25  61
3  82  75  60  72  37  84  39  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that they perceive to be at least as valuable as the bundles received by other agents. This may not always result in a perfectly envy-free solution, but we will try to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (84).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (98).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (82).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (82), but also values item 5 highly (84).

A potential allocation strategy could involve assigning the most valued items to each agent, then distributing the remaining items to minimize overall envy. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item:
   - Agent 0: Item 2
   - Agent 1: Item 5
   - Agent 2: Item 1
   - Agent 3: Item 0

2. Allocate the remaining items:
   - Agent 0 can also receive item 6 (76), since it would increase their perceived value significantly without impacting others as much.
   - Agent 1 can receive item 3 (65), which they value second highest.
   - Agent 2 can receive item 7 (61), which they value higher than others.
   - Agent 3 can receive item 4 (37) to balance their total valuation.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives at least one of their most valued items and distributing the remaining items to balance the perceived total value each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one highly valued item and attempts to balance the total value across agents as evenly as possible.
