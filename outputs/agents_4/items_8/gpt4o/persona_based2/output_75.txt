Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  94  41  44  78  99  29  11
1  34   7  90  73   7  14  26  10
2  84  82  32  96   7  23  32   6
3  33  51  93  40   4  29  60  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible, ideally achieving an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a potential approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - There are 4 agents and 8 items, so ideally, each agent should receive 2 items.
   - We aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Begin by assigning the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item they highly value.
   - Consider the second highest valued items for each agent, ensuring no agent is envious of another's allocation.

3. **Allocate items:**
   - For agent 0, the highest valued items are 0 and 5 (valuations 99).
   - For agent 1, the highest valued item is 2 (valuation 90).
   - For agent 2, the highest valued item is 3 (valuation 96).
   - For agent 3, the highest valued item is 2 and 7 (valuations 93 and 86).

Based on this strategy, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 5 (valuations 99, 99).
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 3 (valuations 90, 73).
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 6 (valuations 82, 32).
- **Agent 3**: Items 4 and 7 (valuations 4, 86).

Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute items based on each agent's valuation, subject to the constraint that each agent receives two items.
