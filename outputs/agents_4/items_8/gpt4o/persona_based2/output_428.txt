Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  19  79  37  49  61  83  49
1  87  86  82  91  51  90  52  56
2   4  46  14   7  89  45  81   4
3  86  59  14  32  36  14  35  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to find an allocation that minimizes envy and distributes the items in a balanced manner. Given the valuations matrix, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value while trying to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

The valuations matrix is as follows:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  19  79  37  49  61  83  49
1  87  86  82  91  51  90  52  56
2   4  46  14   7  89  45  81   4
3  86  59  14  32  36  14  35  67
```

We will use a heuristic approach to allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 6, 2, and 5 (valuations 83, 79, 61)
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 3, 5, and 0 (valuations 91, 90, 87)
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 4, 6, and 5 (valuations 89, 81, 45)
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 0, 7, and 1 (valuations 86, 67, 59)

Using these preferences, we allocate items as follows:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 3 is with Agent 1).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for item 6 is with Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for item 4 is with Agent 2).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation for item 5 is with Agent 1).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation for item 2 is with Agent 0).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation for item 0 is with Agent 3).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation for item 1 is with Agent 3).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation for item 7 is with Agent 2).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to minimize envy based on the valuations provided.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
