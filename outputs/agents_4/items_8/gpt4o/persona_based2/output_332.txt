Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  60  80  53  68  26  35  16
1  49  93  21  63  65  80  55  98
2  78  52  81  40  26  14  28  57
3  69  17  24  78  25  97  94  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [69 17 24 78 25 97 94 31]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items so that no agent envies another. Given the valuations, we will try to allocate items so that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 2 (80), 4 (68), and 1 (60).
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 1 (93), 7 (98), and 5 (80).
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 2 (81), 0 (78), and 7 (57).
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 5 (97), 6 (94), and 3 (78).

We'll try to allocate high-value items first to each agent to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (value 80) and item 4 (value 68).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (value 93) and item 7 (value 98).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (value 78) and item 6 (value 28).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 5 (value 97) and item 3 (value 78).

This allocation ensures that:
- Each agent receives at least two items.
- The allocations consider each agent's highest valued items, minimizing potential envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```
