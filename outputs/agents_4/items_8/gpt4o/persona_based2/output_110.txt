Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  27  94  42   8  78  82  73
1   8  63  14  81  67   6  46  79
2  27  49  18  39  18  56  27  60
3  57  34  42  32  48  90   3  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

One potential approach is to use a method like the "adjusted winner" procedure or a modified version of the "divide and choose" method. However, given the integer constraint and the need to allocate all items, we can use a simpler heuristic approach to attempt a fair allocation.

First, we'll sum up each agent's total valuation to get an idea of how much they value all the items combined:

- Agent 0: \(22 + 27 + 94 + 42 + 8 + 78 + 82 + 73 = 426\)
- Agent 1: \(8 + 63 + 14 + 81 + 67 + 6 + 46 + 79 = 364\)
- Agent 2: \(27 + 49 + 18 + 39 + 18 + 56 + 27 + 60 = 294\)
- Agent 3: \(57 + 34 + 42 + 32 + 48 + 90 + 3 + 76 = 382\)

Next, let's allocate items aiming to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Agent 0**: Given their high valuation, they should likely receive items they value highly.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a moderate valuation, so they should receive items that they value more compared to others.
3. **Agent 2**: They have the lowest total valuation, so we should ensure they get a fair share.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent is similar to Agent 1 in terms of total valuation.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items they value highly are 2 and 6.
- Agent 1: Items they value highly are 3 and 7.
- Agent 2: Items they value moderately are 5 and 1.
- Agent 3: Items they value highly are 0 and 4.

Here's an allocation that attempts to consider these valuations:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 7]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 5]
- **Agent 3**: [0, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they value relatively more compared to other agents, aiming for a fair distribution based on their preferences.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
