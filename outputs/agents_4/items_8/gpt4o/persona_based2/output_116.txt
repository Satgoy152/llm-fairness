Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90   4  81  54  25  64  92  45
1  32  78  54  18  32  48  39  34
2   6  83  55  53  83  72  53  13
3  68  66  43  79  25  54  57  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we aim for a solution that minimizes envy among agents. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - There are 4 agents and 8 items, so each agent should receive 2 items.
   - The total valuations for each agent can guide us in distributing the items.

2. **Total Valuations**:
   - Agent 0: 90 + 4 + 81 + 54 + 25 + 64 + 92 + 45 = 455
   - Agent 1: 32 + 78 + 54 + 18 + 32 + 48 + 39 + 34 = 335
   - Agent 2: 6 + 83 + 55 + 53 + 83 + 72 + 53 + 13 = 418
   - Agent 3: 68 + 66 + 43 + 79 + 25 + 54 + 57 + 49 = 441

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by assigning the highest valued items for each agent to reduce envy.
   - Ensure that each agent gets 2 items.

4. **Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most with 92, followed by item 0 with 90.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most with 78, followed by item 2 with 54.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most with 83, followed by item 1 with 83 (already taken, next is item 5 with 72).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most with 79, followed by item 0 (already taken, next is item 1 which is taken, then item 5 is taken, so item 7 with 49).

5. **Final Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 2]
   - Agent 2: Items [4, 5]
   - Agent 3: Items [3, 7]

6. **Check**:
   - Each agent has 2 items.
   - Total items allocated: 8 (which is correct).

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
