Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  69  58  70  41  75  48  57
1  73  52   9  38   8  60  13  51
2  80   9   8  61  32  26  31  81
3  43  68  62  59  27  13  42  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should prefer their own bundle of items over any other agent's bundle. However, since each agent has different valuations for each item, it's challenging to achieve complete envy-freeness. Instead, we can attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Let's analyze and allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- **Agent 0**: This agent values items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 highly, especially item 5 with a valuation of 75.
- **Agent 1**: This agent values items 0, 5, 1, and 7 highly, especially item 0 with a valuation of 73.
- **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 7, and 3, especially item 7 with a valuation of 81.
- **Agent 3**: This agent values items 7, 1, and 2 highly, especially item 7 with a valuation of 84.

Given these preferences, we can try to allocate the items as follows:

1. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0, who values it the most.
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, who values it highly.
3. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3, who values it the most.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, who has a reasonably high valuation for it.
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3, who also values it highly.
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0, as it balances their allocation.
7. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, who values it more than others.
8. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, who has the space for an additional item.

This allocation attempts to balance the valuation each agent receives and minimizes envy to the extent possible.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 8 items are distributed.
