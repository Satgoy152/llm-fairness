Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  45  24  37  61  15  84  73
1  25  18  42  95  66  60  78  53
2  60  37   6  75  60  36  79  68
3  74  69  65  23  93  14   3  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents and ensure envy-freeness to the extent possible. One approach is to use a variant of the "Round Robin" or "Greedy" allocation method, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued item that hasn't been allocated yet.

Let's follow this method:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 6 (value 84).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 3 (value 95).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 6, but it's taken, so picks item 4 (value 60).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 4, but it's taken, so picks item 0 (value 74).

Now, let's continue with the remaining items and repeat the process:

5. **Agent 0** picks item 7 (value 73).
6. **Agent 1** picks item 4, but it's taken, so picks item 6, but it's taken, so picks item 2 (value 42).
7. **Agent 2** picks item 7, but it's taken, so picks item 3, but it's taken, so picks item 0, but it's taken, so picks item 1 (value 37).
8. **Agent 3** picks item 1, but it's taken, so picks item 2, but it's taken, so picks item 5 (value 14).

The allocations can be optimized further by considering trade-offs or exchanges among agents to improve envy-freeness, but a simple round-robin approach gives a reasonable initial allocation.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent 2 items and utilizes all 8 items, aiming to balance the valuations as fairly as possible.
