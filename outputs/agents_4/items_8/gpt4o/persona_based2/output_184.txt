Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33   6  16  65  12  23  84  39
1  70  93  41  22  13  49  21  36
2   6  27  18  26  32  80  26  38
3  66  53   8  15  53   7  22  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their valuation while attempting to achieve an envy-free distribution. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 33 + 6 + 16 + 65 + 12 + 23 + 84 + 39 = 278
- Agent 1: 70 + 93 + 41 + 22 + 13 + 49 + 21 + 36 = 345
- Agent 2: 6 + 27 + 18 + 26 + 32 + 80 + 26 + 38 = 253
- Agent 3: 66 + 53 + 8 + 15 + 53 + 7 + 22 + 92 = 316

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent's allocation is as valuable as possible based on their own valuation. Given that there are eight items and four agents, each agent should receive two items if possible.

Let's allocate the items one by one, trying to maximize each agent's total valuation while keeping the process fair:

1. **Maximizing Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most at 84, then item 3 at 65.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 93, then item 0 at 70.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most at 80, then item 4 at 32.
   - Agent 3 values item 7 the most at 92, then item 0 at 66.

2. **Allocating the Highest Valued Items:**
   - Agent 0: Allocate items 6 and 3.
   - Agent 1: Allocate items 1 and 0.
   - Agent 2: Allocate items 5 and 4.
   - Agent 3: Allocate items 7 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that maximize their utility within the constraints provided, and each agent receives two items.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation seeks to provide a fair and balanced distribution based on the agents' valuations, with each agent receiving items they highly value, minimizing potential envy.
