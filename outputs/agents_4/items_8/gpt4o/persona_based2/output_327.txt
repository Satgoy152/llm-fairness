Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  42  38  26  93  29  13  98
1  84  93  72  88  80   1  66   1
2  28  37  31   5  63  33  86  55
3  35  16  58  96  51  14  64  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method called the "Round-Robin" procedure, which is often used in fair division problems. This method involves each agent taking turns to choose the most valuable available item until all items are allocated. 

Firstly, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 384
- Agent 1: 485
- Agent 2: 338
- Agent 3: 430

Now, let's execute the round-robin selection process:

1. **Round 1**:
   - Agent 1 selects item 1 (value 93).
   - Agent 0 selects item 7 (value 98).
   - Agent 3 selects item 3 (value 96).
   - Agent 2 selects item 6 (value 86).

2. **Round 2**:
   - Agent 1 selects item 0 (value 84).
   - Agent 0 selects item 4 (value 93).
   - Agent 3 selects item 2 (value 58).
   - Agent 2 selects item 5 (value 33).

3. **Round 3**:
   - Agent 1 selects item 6 (value 66) - not available, chooses next highest, which is item 4 (value 80).
   - Agent 0 selects item 3 (value 26) - not available, chooses next highest, which is item 2 (value 38).
   - Agent 3 selects item 1 (value 16) - not available, chooses next highest, which is item 0 (value 35).
   - Agent 2 selects item 7 (value 55).

After this allocation, all 8 items are assigned. Hereâ€™s the final allocation of items:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [6, 5, 7],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated items based on their preferences, with an emphasis on maximizing their total value, ensuring a fair division of the items.
