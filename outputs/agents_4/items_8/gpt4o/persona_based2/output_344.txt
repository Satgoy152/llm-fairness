Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  76  71  36  11  34  31  78
1  52  46  57  44  30  66  33  67
2  26  72  70  93  22  15  32   3
3  72  20  83  53  83  87  27  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we must consider the agents' valuations for each item. Our goal is to allocate items such that envy among agents is minimized, and each agent receives an integer number of items. The solution should aim for envy-freeness as much as possible, though it might not be entirely achievable with integer allocations and discrete items.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify items with high unique value:** Some items are significantly more valuable to one agent compared to others. Allocating these items to the agent who values them most can reduce the overall envy.

2. **Balance the total value each agent receives:** Try to distribute the total value of items as evenly as possible among the agents.

Let's analyze the table and make allocations based on these principles:

- Agent 0 values item 7 highly at 78, more than any other agent values any item. This suggests item 7 should go to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high value for item 5 at 66.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly at 93, much more than others value it.
- Agent 3 has a high unique value for item 5 at 87.

Following this strategy, the allocation might be:

- **Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 7**  
  (Values: 76, 76, 78 = Total 230)

- **Agent 1: Items 5, 6**  
  (Values: 66, 33 = Total 99)

- **Agent 2: Items 2, 3**  
  (Values: 70, 93 = Total 163)

- **Agent 3: Items 4**  
  (Values: 83 = Total 83)

Each agent receives a fair share based on their values, and all items are allocated. The allocation is not perfectly envy-free due to the discrete nature of the items, but it aims to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4]
}
```
