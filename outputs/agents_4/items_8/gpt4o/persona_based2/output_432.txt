Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  35  27  38  59  26  23  25
1  21  12  39  35  69  79  28   0
2   0  15  73  28  12  31  79  13
3  99  16  64  78  55  33  33  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not always be possible, so we will strive for an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Let's examine the valuations to come up with a reasonable allocation. One approach is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's happiness relative to the others while ensuring each agent gets approximately an equal number of items.

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are highest for items 0 and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are highest for item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are highest for items 2 and 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are highest for items 0, 3, and 7.

Given these preferences, let's try the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 4. (Values: 62, 59)
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 and 3. (Values: 79, 35)
- **Agent 2**: Items 2 and 6. (Values: 73, 79)
- **Agent 3**: Items 1 and 7. (Values: 16, 91)

This allocation strategy is designed to optimize each agent's total valuation while distributing items as evenly as possible. 

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each of the 8 items is assigned, and each agent receives exactly 2 items, which can help in achieving a fair distribution, given the constraints.
