Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  75  53  16   2  91  78  81
1  65  85   9  60  94  35  91  62
2  35  19  81  42  89  26  81  67
3  56  74  60  54  25  28  42  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute items such that no agent envies another's allocation. This is a challenging problem, and finding an envy-free allocation isn't always possible, but we can aim for a division that is as fair as possible.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** We can start by identifying items that are highly valued by each agent and try to allocate those items to them.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets a Fair Share:** Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

3. **Balance Total Valuation Across Agents:** We should aim for each agent's total valuation for their allocated items to be as balanced as possible.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0:** Highly values items 1 and 5.
- **Agent 1:** Highly values items 4 and 1.
- **Agent 2:** Highly values items 2 and 4.
- **Agent 3:** Highly values items 7 and 1.

With these observations, we attempt a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0 (11) and 5 (91) - Total value: 102.
- **Agent 1:** Items 1 (85) and 6 (91) - Total value: 176.
- **Agent 2:** Items 2 (81) and 4 (89) - Total value: 170.
- **Agent 3:** Items 3 (54) and 7 (88) - Total value: 142.

While this allocation might not be perfectly envy-free, it attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
