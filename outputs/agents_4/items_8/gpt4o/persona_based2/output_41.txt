Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  41  37  70  21  51  11  60
1  94  39  86  26  33  64  16  87
2  31  28  31  10  43  10  66  73
3  13  27  65   3  10  98   0  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we want to allocate the items to the agents in a way that reflects their valuations and aims for fairness. A common approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we'll aim for an allocation that seeks to balance the total value perceived by each agent. 

Let's compute the optimal allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (70) and item 7 (60).  
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (94) and item 7 (87).  
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 6 (66) and item 7 (73).  
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (98).

Considering these preferences and aiming for a fair distribution, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0** can receive items 3 and 7, which they value highly.
- **Agent 1** can receive items 0 and 2, balancing high value items.
- **Agent 2** can receive items 6 and 4, covered by their high valuation on item 6.
- **Agent 3** can receive items 5 and 1, with item 5 being the most valuable for them.

Let's ensure all items are allocated and each agent has a fair share:

- Agent 0: [3, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [6, 4]
- Agent 3: [5, 1]

Each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated. This distribution tries to ensure that each agent gets a satisfactory amount from their perspective, considering their highest-value items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```
