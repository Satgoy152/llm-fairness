Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  63   2   7  91  85  22  62
1  85  53  80  64  69  13  39  51
2  61  80  31  38  99   6  61  92
3  44  95  38  27  22  33  75  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, or at least reduce envy as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations, we will attempt to create a fair distribution based on the given valuations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 45 + 63 + 2 + 7 + 91 + 85 + 22 + 62 = 377
   - Agent 1: 85 + 53 + 80 + 64 + 69 + 13 + 39 + 51 = 454
   - Agent 2: 61 + 80 + 31 + 38 + 99 + 6 + 61 + 92 = 468
   - Agent 3: 44 + 95 + 38 + 27 + 22 + 33 + 75 + 47 = 381

2. **Allocate Items to Agents:**
   - Start by assigning the highest valued items for each agent.
   - Ensure that each agent gets about two items initially, considering their highest valuations.

3. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Choose items 4 (91) and 5 (85).
   - Agent 1: Choose items 0 (85) and 2 (80).
   - Agent 2: Choose items 4 (99) and 7 (92).
   - Agent 3: Choose items 1 (95) and 6 (75).

4. **Adjust for Fair Allocation:**
   - Re-evaluate if any agent can get a better value by swapping items without increasing envy.
   - Ensure there are no duplicate allocations of items.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 4 (91) and 5 (85)
   - Agent 1: Items 0 (85) and 2 (80)
   - Agent 2: Items 7 (92) and 3 (38)
   - Agent 3: Items 1 (95) and 6 (75)

This allocation attempts to give each agent some of their most valued items while distributing the total value as evenly as possible. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

Please note that achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible with integer allocations and given the constraints, but this attempt balances the allocation based on agents' valuations.
