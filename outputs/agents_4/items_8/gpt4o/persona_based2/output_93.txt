Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  94   6  74  67  69  94  24
1  72  27  61  33  88   1  71   3
2  44  78  75  54  27  11   6  45
3  58  11  46  40  92  65  50  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences. One common approach to achieve this is the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued available item until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with a round-robin allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (94), so they will pick item 1.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (88), so they will pick item 4.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (75), so they will pick item 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the highest, but it's taken, so they go for item 0 (58).

At this point, each agent has received one item.

5. **Agent 0**'s next highest value is item 6 (94), so they will pick item 6.
6. **Agent 1**'s next highest value is item 0 (72), but it's taken. The next available is item 3 (33).
7. **Agent 2**'s next highest value is item 1 (78), but it's taken. The next available is item 3 (54), which is taken. The next is item 7 (45).
8. **Agent 3**'s next highest value is item 5 (65), so they will pick item 5.

Now each agent has two items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items based on their preferences in a sequential manner.
