Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  39  17  77  69  22   8  85
1   4  90  26  47  36  43  71  56
2  78  68  53  80  63  96  58  58
3  67  96  88  62   1  24   4  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly. We'll consider each agent's preferences and try to achieve an allocation that minimizes potential envy.

Here is a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 7 the highest (85). We will allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the highest (90). We will allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the highest (96). We will allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the highest (96), but it is already allocated. Next highest is item 2 (88). We will allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and 4 items are left: 0, 3, 4, and 6.

5. **Agent 0**: Next highest-valued item is 0 (83). We will allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 2**: Next highest-valued item is 3 (80). We will allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 3**: Next highest-valued item is 7 (88), already allocated to Agent 0. Next is item 4 (62). We will allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
8. **Agent 1**: Remaining item is 6 (71), which is also highly valued by Agent 1. We will allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and the total number of items allocated equals 8. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
