Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  78  14  20  13  56  53   8
1  49   3  96  63   4  17  26  33
2  74  89   2   8  76   6  55  46
3  45  74  22  16  71   0  53  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can utilize the concept of maximizing each agent's satisfaction while balancing the allocations such that no agent envies another. 

Let's start by examining each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items based on maximizing their total valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (78)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (96)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (89) (already allocated), next highest is Item 4 (76)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (74) (already allocated), next highest is Item 4 (71) (already allocated)
   - Allocate Item 0 (45) to Agent 3

5. **Distribute remaining items**:
   - Remaining items: 3, 5, 6, 7

6. **Agent 0**:
   - Remaining highest value: Item 5 (56)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0

7. **Agent 1**:
   - Remaining highest value: Item 3 (63)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1

8. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining highest value: Item 6 (55)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2

9. **Agent 3**:
   - Remaining highest value: Item 7 (18)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 3

### Final Allocations

The final allocations based on maximizing value while attempting to maintain fairness are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with items they value highly while distributing the remaining items in a way that maintains balanced satisfaction among agents.
