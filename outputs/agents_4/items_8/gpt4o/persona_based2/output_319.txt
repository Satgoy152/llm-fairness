Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  67  10  27  72  84  91   6
1  16  72  92  85  23  95   2  24
2  33  90  31  79  44  74  79  86
3  23  75  98  83  85  16  51  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuation and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives. Given that each agent must receive an integer number of items and only 8 items are available, we'll use a strategy to distribute the items in a way that aims to minimize envy among the agents.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items that agent 0 values highly. Items 0 and 6 have high values for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Choose items that are valued highly by agent 1. Items 2 and 5 are highly valued by agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that agent 2 values highly. Items 1 and 7 are good choices for this agent.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items that have high values for agent 3. Items 3 and 4 fit this criteria.

Now, let's verify the allocations and ensure all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4]

This allocation distributes all 8 items across the 4 agents while trying to respect their individual valuations and minimizing potential envy.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
