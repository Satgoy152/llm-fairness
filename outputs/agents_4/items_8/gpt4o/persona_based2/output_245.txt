Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  64  55  28  19  95  76  72
1  41  86  51  37  82  18  54  62
2  16  99   2  79  77  59  88  64
3  70  58  10  44  83  64   6  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations. A common approach is to ensure the allocation is envy-free, where no agent prefers the bundle of items given to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values items highly at indices 1 and 5.
- Agent 1: Values items highly at indices 1 and 4.
- Agent 2: Values items highly at indices 1 and 6.
- Agent 3: Values items highly at indices 0 and 4.

A possible allocation strategy is to give each agent a share of items that maximizes their individual happiness while minimizing envy. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 since it is valued highest by them (99).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 since it is valued highest by them (95).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 since it is valued highest by them (83).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 since it is valued second-highest by them (70).
5. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 since it is valued second-highest by them (88).
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since it is valued second-highest by them (55).
7. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 since it is valued highest by them after item 1 (62).
8. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since it is valued second-highest by them (37).

This allocation gives each agent a bundle of items that should minimize envy given their valuations. 

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
