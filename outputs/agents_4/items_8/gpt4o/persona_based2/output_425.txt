Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  59  52  29  64  42  71  79
1  33  46  62  79  69  72  81   6
2  37  33  42  38  31  92  59  52
3  70  83  78  47   2  64  54  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly and ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach to achieve this is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of the utilities of all agents. This method often results in allocations that are both efficient and fair.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair division:

1. Create a matrix of the valuations.
2. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
3. Attempt to distribute the items such that the product of the utilities of each agent is maximized.

Let's determine an allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 values items 5 and 3 highly.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 3 highly values items 1 and 3.

We'll try to distribute the items based on the highest preferences to achieve the most balanced and fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 7]

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items among the agents while considering their preferences. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every item is distributed, and each agent receives items aligned with their highest valuations as much as possible.
