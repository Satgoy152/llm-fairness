Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  72  49  47   2  59  46  67
1  96  16  18  86   7  64  30  96
2  40  72   1  73  14  73  56  35
3  32  24  66  18  11  39  96  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received an equitable share based on their valuations. The goal is to make sure each agent receives a fair portion of items such that no agent envies another's allocation given the valuations.

We'll use the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum satisfaction, also known as the "maximin" approach, to allocate items. This involves distributing items to boost the minimum happiness among agents, ensuring fairness.

Here's a suggested allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 0 (79) highly, so we will prioritize giving them item 0. They also value items 1 (72) and 7 (67) significantly.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values items 0 (96) and 7 (96) the most, but since item 0 is allocated to Agent 0, item 7 will be allocated to them. They also value item 3 (86) highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 (73) and item 3 (73) highly. Since item 3 is allocated to Agent 1, we will allocate item 5 to them. They will also receive item 1 (72).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 (96) highly, and it is not yet allocated, so they will receive this item. They also value item 7 (74), but since it is allocated to Agent 1, we will allocate item 2 (66) to them.

Considering this approach, here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 7.
- Agent 2 receives item 5.
- Agent 3 receives items 6, 2, and 4.

Each agent is allocated items based on their highest valuations, aiming to maximize each agent's satisfaction and minimize envy among agents. The allocation considers all items, ensuring a total of 8 items are allocated.
