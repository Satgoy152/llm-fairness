Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  49  81  14  83  60  13  97
1  61  18  52  97  96  17  98  42
2  90  39  83  70  31  10   4  90
3  62  51  56  89  68  20   0  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy among agents, we need to allocate items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value approximately equally or that maximizes their individual utility while considering the utilities of the other agents. This is a complex problem, but I will provide a solution that aims to allocate items fairly based on the given valuations.

Let's first consider the total value of each item for all agents:

- Item 0: 17 + 61 + 90 + 62 = 230
- Item 1: 49 + 18 + 39 + 51 = 157
- Item 2: 81 + 52 + 83 + 56 = 272
- Item 3: 14 + 97 + 70 + 89 = 270
- Item 4: 83 + 96 + 31 + 68 = 278
- Item 5: 60 + 17 + 10 + 20 = 107
- Item 6: 13 + 98 + 4 + 0 = 115
- Item 7: 97 + 42 + 90 + 11 = 240

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents in a way that attempts to balance their total valuations:

1. Assign the highest valued item of each agent first:
   - Agent 0 values item 7 the most (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the most (98).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most (90).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (89).

2. Allocate remaining items to balance total utility:
   - Agent 0: After item 7, add item 5 to balance values without causing much envy (60).
   - Agent 1: After item 6, add item 4 to provide a high value (96).
   - Agent 2: After item 0, add item 2 to balance values (83).
   - Agent 3: After item 3, add item 1 to balance values (51).

Based on this allocation strategy, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```

Each agent receives two items, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy and maximize individual satisfaction based on the given valuations.
