Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  40  56  74  47   8  30  52
1  86  28  77  83  98  31  73  64
2  42  58  71   1   8  66  56  52
3  58  57  53   6  95  66  84  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we'll look for a way to distribute items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share based on their valuations. Given the valuations matrix, we'll aim for a distribution where no agent envies another agent's bundle of items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initialize**: Start by examining each agent's highest-valued items and attempt to allocate them with a focus on creating a balanced distribution.

2. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 0 (84), 3 (74)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (98), 0 (86)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

4. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (71), 5 (66)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

5. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 7 (87), 6 (84)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

6. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Reassess remaining unallocated items: 1, 3, 5, 6.
   - Items remaining: 1, 3, 5, 6.

7. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 next preference: 3 (74)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 next preference: 6 (73)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 next preference: 5 (66)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 next preference: 1 (57)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

By following this allocation strategy, each agent receives items that are relatively valuable to them, maintaining the notion of fairness as much as possible given the constraints.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [7, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives a set of items that attempts to balance their personal valuations.
