Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  29  77   7  85  26  52  58
1  68   7  85  63  98  81  43  46
2  18  22  46  26  25  11  64  82
3  85   6  20  13  25  37  29  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, let's use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy by attempting to balance the value each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Items and their Valuations:**

   | Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
   |------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
   | 0          | 78 | 29 | 77 | 7  | 85 | 26 | 52 | 58 |
   | 1          | 68 | 7  | 85 | 63 | 98 | 81 | 43 | 46 |
   | 2          | 18 | 22 | 46 | 26 | 25 | 11 | 64 | 82 |
   | 3          | 85 | 6  | 20 | 13 | 25 | 37 | 29 | 28 |

2. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item:**

   Let's sum the valuations for each item to understand overall demand:

   - Item 0: 78 + 68 + 18 + 85 = 249
   - Item 1: 29 + 7 + 22 + 6 = 64
   - Item 2: 77 + 85 + 46 + 20 = 228
   - Item 3: 7 + 63 + 26 + 13 = 109
   - Item 4: 85 + 98 + 25 + 25 = 233
   - Item 5: 26 + 81 + 11 + 37 = 155
   - Item 6: 52 + 43 + 64 + 29 = 188
   - Item 7: 58 + 46 + 82 + 28 = 214

3. **Allocate Items to Agents:**

   We aim to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share of their highest-valued items while balancing the overall value distribution.

   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 0 (78) and 4 (85).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for items 4 (98) and 2 (85).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are for items 7 (82) and 6 (64).
   - Agent 3: Highest values are for items 0 (85) and 5 (37).

   Let's allocate based on these preferences while ensuring balance:

   - **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2] (values: 78, 77)
   - **Agent 1**: Items [4, 3] (values: 98, 63)
   - **Agent 2**: Items [7, 6] (values: 82, 64)
   - **Agent 3**: Items [5, 1] (values: 37, 6)

4. **Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the agents' preferences and distribute items in a manner that each agent receives items they highly value, thus aiming for a fair and envy-free distribution.
