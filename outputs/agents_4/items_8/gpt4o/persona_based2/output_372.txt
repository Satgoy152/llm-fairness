Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  80  83  19  32  11   9  17
1   5  19   6  76  59  83   7  48
2  55  67  93  35  96  16  51  83
3  41   8  11  86   9  93  32  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the principle of envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent, based on their personal valuations. This means each agent should ideally be at least as happy with their bundle as they would be with any other agent's bundle.

1. **Identify High-Value Items Per Agent:**  
   - Agent 0: Values items 0, 1, and 2 highly.
   - Agent 1: Values item 5 the highest, followed by 3 and 4.
   - Agent 2: Values items 2, 4, and 7 highly.
   - Agent 3: Values items 3 and 5 highly.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High Valuation:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Items left: 1, 2, 6, 7.

4. **Allocate the Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0: Already has item 0, next high-value item is 1. Allocate item 1.
   - Agent 1: Has item 5, next high-value is 3, which is taken, so allocate item 7 (next highest not allocated).
   - Agent 2: Has item 4, next high-value is 2. Allocate item 2.
   - Agent 3: Has item 3, next high-value is 5, which is taken, so allocate item 6.

5. **Re-evaluate and Adjust if Necessary:**
   - Check if any agent would prefer another agent's allocation and adjust if needed to maintain envy-freeness. Here, each agent has some of their high-value items and is not strictly envious of others.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives two items, and the distribution attempts to balance the envy-freeness by allocating items that are of high relative value to each agent.
