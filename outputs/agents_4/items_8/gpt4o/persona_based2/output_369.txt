Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  78  95   2  69  57  59  36
1  67  19  72   7  65   2  48  61
2  61  90  26  69  50  10   7  57
3   3  52  91  64  97   5  67  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation with a focus on envy-freeness, we need to assign items to agents such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We'll use a strategy that attempts to maximize the minimum satisfaction among all agents while ensuring all items are allocated.

Given the valuations, a simple approach is to use the method of "maximin share" which aims to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items they perceive as at least as valuable as their fair share if they were to divide items themselves. However, with integer constraints and the need to allocate exactly 8 items, we'll aim to balance the allocation such that each agent's total valuation is as high as possible without any agent feeling significantly worse off.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items:  
   - Agent 0: 54 + 78 + 95 + 2 + 69 + 57 + 59 + 36 = 450
   - Agent 1: 67 + 19 + 72 + 7 + 65 + 2 + 48 + 61 = 341
   - Agent 2: 61 + 90 + 26 + 69 + 50 + 10 + 7 + 57 = 370
   - Agent 3: 3 + 52 + 91 + 64 + 97 + 5 + 67 + 97 = 476

2. Assign high-value items to agents that value them the most, while ensuring no agent is left with significantly fewer items.

3. Ensure each agent receives at least one item to avoid complete envy.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items they value highly, but also ensuring others get high-valued items they prefer.
- Agent 1 receives items that they value relatively more compared to others.
- Agent 2 and 3 receive items based on their high valuations and remaining items.

**Proposed Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, valued at 54 and 95 respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 6, valued at 19 and 48 respectively.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 5, valued at 69 and 10 respectively.
- Agent 3 receives items 4 and 7, valued at 97 and 97 respectively.

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences while distributing all items.
