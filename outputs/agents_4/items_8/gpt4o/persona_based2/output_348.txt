Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  99  31  36  37  24  38  10
1  43   8  24  35  13  12  28  80
2  42  32  62  68  87  10  14   1
3  45  87  67  26  56  21  19  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy and tries to give each agent a reasonable share based on their valuations. We will attempt to allocate the items so that each agent gets an approximately equal share of their perceived value.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuation is for item 1 (99), followed by item 0 (79).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 7 (80), followed by item 0 (43).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 4 (87), followed by item 3 (68).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuation is for item 1 (87), followed by item 2 (67).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** We allocate items 0 and 1, which are their highest valued items.
  
- **Agent 1:** We allocate item 7, their highest valued item.
  
- **Agent 2:** We allocate items 4 and 3, which are their highest valued items.
  
- **Agent 3:** We allocate items 2, 5, and 6, because item 1 is already taken by agents with higher valuations.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value, given the constraints. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that they value relatively highly.
