Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  74  59   0   0  71  72  43
1  86  25   4  78  21  94  83  47
2  51  39  73  32  72  91  24  88
3  99  75  52  30  42  98  66  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of maximizing the total utility for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. One approach is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" where agents pick their most valued item in turns. Given the table, we will assign items to agents by looking at their valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest (99), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest (94), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (74), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 2** values item 7 the highest (88), so we allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

Now, we continue with the next highest unallocated item for each agent.

5. **Agent 3** values item 6 next highest (66), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 1** values item 3 next highest (78), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 0** values item 5 next highest (71), but it's taken, so we choose the next highest which is item 6 (72), but it's also taken, so item 2 (59) is allocated to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 2** values item 4 next highest (72), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

This way, all items are allocated. The allocation minimizes envy to the extent possible given the input valuations.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. This allocation considers the highest preferences sequentially to attempt to minimize envy.
