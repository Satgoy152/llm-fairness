Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  91   4  23  10  30  53  27
1  91  21  52  97  93  59  91  48
2  50  83  75  80  96   3  57  18
3  20  41  40  93  96  85  94  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to consider an allocation that minimizes envy and respects each agent's preferences as much as possible. Given the valuations provided, we'll look for an allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, focusing on maximizing total satisfaction and reducing potential envy.

Here is one possible allocation that attempts to balance these considerations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly compared to others.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most, followed by items 0, 6, and 4.
- Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 4, followed by items 3 and 2.
- Agent 3 values items 4, 5, 6, and 7 significantly.

We'll aim to allocate items such that each agent receives items they highly value, while also ensuring all items are allocated.

### Allocation:
1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (high value for Agent 0).
2. Assign items 3 and 0 to Agent 1 (high values for Agent 1).
3. Assign items 4 and 2 to Agent 2 (high values for Agent 2).
4. Assign items 5, 6, and 7 to Agent 3 (high values for Agent 3).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value relatively highly, striving for fairness and minimal envy. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints, ensuring that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents.
