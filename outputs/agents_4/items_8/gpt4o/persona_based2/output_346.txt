Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  86  81  95   5  12  34  97
1  89  44  68  17  60  25  28  26
2  25  48  88  19  74   3  49  53
3  81   0  48  57  24  98   0  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

First, let's examine the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 68 + 86 + 81 + 95 + 5 + 12 + 34 + 97 = 478
- Agent 1: 89 + 44 + 68 + 17 + 60 + 25 + 28 + 26 = 357
- Agent 2: 25 + 48 + 88 + 19 + 74 + 3 + 49 + 53 = 359
- Agent 3: 81 + 0 + 48 + 57 + 24 + 98 + 0 + 19 = 327

To achieve a fair allocation, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a set of items that they value highly, without creating significant envy among other agents.

Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 and 7 the most.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 and 4 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 and 6 highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 highly, and can also take item 1.

Based on this analysis, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [3, 7] (Values 95, 97)
- Agent 1: [0, 4] (Values 89, 60)
- Agent 2: [2, 6] (Values 88, 49)
- Agent 3: [1, 5] (Values 0, 98)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, thus aiming for a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
