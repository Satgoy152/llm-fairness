Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  64  75  71  31  83  67  89
1   1  66  44  99  92   6  49  29
2  95   4  66  93  50  79  45  72
3  79  14  27  92   6  61  55  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent envies another's allocation, if possible. Here's one approach to achieve that:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences**: Prioritize allocations where agents have high valuations for specific items.

2. **Balance Allocations**: Ensure that each agent receives a fair share of total value based on their valuations.

3. **Iterate and Adjust**: If an agent feels envy, try adjusting allocations to minimize it while keeping the total value balanced.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: Agent 0 highly values item 0 (98), item 7 (89), and item 5 (83).

2. **Agent 1's Preferences**: Agent 1 highly values item 3 (99), item 4 (92), and item 1 (66).

3. **Agent 2's Preferences**: Agent 2 highly values item 0 (95), item 3 (93), and item 5 (79).

4. **Agent 3's Preferences**: Agent 3 highly values item 3 (92), item 0 (79), and item 7 (68).

Let's allocate based on these preferences while ensuring that every agent gets at least some high-value items.

- **Allocate Items**:
  - Agent 0: [0, 5]
  - Agent 1: [3]
  - Agent 2: [6, 7]
  - Agent 3: [1, 2, 4]

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations, trying to minimize envy. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 8, as required.
