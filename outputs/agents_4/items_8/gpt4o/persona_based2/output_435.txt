Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  57  99  69  55  99  73  57
1  53  71  26  43   6   2  13  10
2  72  82  58  25  57  40  50  57
3  54   5  60  55  70  91   4  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim for an allocation where each agent perceives their share as at least as good as the shares received by others, according to their own valuations. Given the matrix of valuations, we can try to implement a strategy that balances the total perceived value for each agent.

Let's compute an allocation by considering each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 2 and 5 (value 99 each).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 1 (value 71).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 1 (value 82) and item 0 (value 72).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 5 (value 91) and item 4 (value 70).

One possible allocation strategy is to ensure each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction while keeping balances in perceived total values:

- **Agent 0** receives items 2 and 6 (total value = 99 + 73 = 172).
- **Agent 1** receives items 1 and 3 (total value = 71 + 43 = 114).
- **Agent 2** receives items 0 and 7 (total value = 72 + 57 = 129).
- **Agent 3** receives items 4 and 5 (total value = 70 + 91 = 161).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while keeping the distribution relatively balanced in terms of perceived total values. Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
