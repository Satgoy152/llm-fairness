Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  59  93  67  22  36  81  91
1  74  56  34  94  20  31  87  18
2   3  95  46  62   0  93  49  80
3  38  19  26  51  10  70  60  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocated set of items as much as possible. The challenge is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their bundle as at least as valuable as the bundles of the others, or they are indifferent.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify Preferences**: First, look at the valuations to understand which items are most valuable to each agent. This will help in minimizing envy.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate items starting with those that have a significantly higher value for a particular agent compared to others. This reduces the chance of envy.

3. **Iterative Adjustments**: After the initial allocation, make adjustments to ensure that each agent's allocation is as close to their preference as possible, while maintaining a balance.

Let's perform an allocation based on these principles:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 2 and item 7. 
- **Agent 1** highly values item 3.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 1 and item 5.
- **Agent 3** moderately values items.

### Allocation Steps:
1. Give item 2 to Agent 0 because they value it the most (93).
2. Give item 7 to Agent 0 as they value it highly (91).
3. Give item 3 to Agent 1 since they value it the most (94).
4. Give item 1 to Agent 2 because it's their highest valued item (95).
5. Give item 5 to Agent 2 since they value it highly (93).
6. Give item 6 to Agent 1, as they value it highly (87).
7. Give item 0 to Agent 1, as a balanced choice.
8. Finally, give item 4 to Agent 3, as it's not highly valued by others.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, reducing potential envy and trying to maintain fairness. Note that Agent 3 receives one item, which is the least valued item, but this helps balance the distribution.
