Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  49   9  20  50  36  98  45
1  87  49  45  14  61   6  21  22
2  29  60  85  79   2  55   2  84
3   7  22  14  30  16  30  22  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

The valuations of the agents for the items are as follows:

- Agent 0: [66, 49, 9, 20, 50, 36, 98, 45]
- Agent 1: [87, 49, 45, 14, 61, 6, 21, 22]
- Agent 2: [29, 60, 85, 79, 2, 55, 2, 84]
- Agent 3: [7, 22, 14, 30, 16, 30, 22, 93]

A common approach to achieving fair allocation is to use the envy-free criterion, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's proceed to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest valuation is for item 6 (value 98).
2. **Agent 1:** The highest valuation is for item 0 (value 87).
3. **Agent 2:** The highest valuation is for item 2 (value 85).
4. **Agent 3:** The highest valuation is for item 7 (value 93).

Now, we continue allocating remaining items based on maximizing the remaining unallocated items' utility:

- Agent 0's next highest preferences are for items 4 (value 50) and 1 (value 49).
- Agent 1's next highest preferences are for items 4 (value 61) and 1 (value 49).
- Agent 2's next highest preferences are for items 3 (value 79) and 1 (value 60).
- Agent 3's next highest preferences are for items 5 (value 30) and 3 (value 30).

Continuing in this manner, we allocate items to ensure all are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: [6]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 4]
- **Agent 2**: [2, 3]
- **Agent 3**: [7, 5, 1]

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their highest preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [7, 5, 1]
}
```
