Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88   5  70  57   6   5  14  11
1   4  87  33  11  95  56  93  76
2  26  47  22  56  48  80  56  55
3  88  32  68  84  10  59  33  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents using the concept of envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation. Given there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: They highly value item 0 (88) and item 2 (70). Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their valuation.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 4 (95) and item 6 (93). Assigning these items to Agent 1 provides them with a high valuation.

3. **Agent 2**: They have a high valuation for item 5 (80) and item 3 (56). Assigning these items to Agent 2 gives them a good value.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 7 (60) and item 1 (32) fairly well. Allocating these items to Agent 3 provides a reasonable valuation.

Now, let's check to see if this allocation is envy-free. Each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agents' allocation from their perspective. Given each agent's highest-valued items are prioritized for them, they should not envy another's allocation.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [7, 1]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, contributing to the fairness and potential envy-freeness of the allocation.
