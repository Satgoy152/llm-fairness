Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  48  22  56  20  73  77  70
1  12  51  34  70  95  14  44  37
2   9  32  10  41  66  99  64  34
3  24  34  47  53  52  95  69  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness, ensuring that each agent gets a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own. Given 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. However, since the goal is to minimize envy, we may need to adjust the allocations slightly to achieve a more balanced distribution.

Let's first evaluate the total value each agent has for all items to get an initial sense of their preferences:

- Agent 0: 58 + 48 + 22 + 56 + 20 + 73 + 77 + 70 = 424
- Agent 1: 12 + 51 + 34 + 70 + 95 + 14 + 44 + 37 = 357
- Agent 2: 9 + 32 + 10 + 41 + 66 + 99 + 64 + 34 = 355
- Agent 3: 24 + 34 + 47 + 53 + 52 + 95 + 69 + 95 = 469

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items step-by-step by selecting items that maximize individual agent values while attempting to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: The items with the highest values for agent 0 are 6 (77) and 5 (73).
2. **Agent 1**: The items with the highest values for agent 1 are 4 (95) and 3 (70).
3. **Agent 2**: The items with the highest values for agent 2 are 5 (99) and 6 (64). However, these items are already taken, so the next best are 4 (66) and 3 (41).
4. **Agent 3**: The items with the highest values for agent 3 are 5 (95), 7 (95), and 6 (69). Items 5 and 6 are already taken, so agent 3 gets 7 (95) and 2 (47).

Let's finalize the allocations ensuring each agent gets approximately two items while considering their preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Items 5 and 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 3 and 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 and 1
- **Agent 3**: Items 7 and 2

These allocations aim to balance the agents' preferences as closely as possible, given their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [7, 2]
}
```
