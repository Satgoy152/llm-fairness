Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  13   6   8  51  35  70  87
1  52  48  96  59  68  36  44  86
2   5   7  86  72  70  77  87  83
3  17  87  61  45  35  65   3  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy among the agents. This is a complex problem, often requiring iterative processes or heuristic methods to approach a solution.

Given the valuations provided for each agent on the items, a possible approach is to use a method similar to the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where each agent picks their most valued remaining item in turns.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 7 (value 87).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 2 (value 96).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 6 (value 87).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 1 (value 87).

After the first round, items 1, 2, 6, and 7 are allocated. Now consider the remaining items and repeat the process:

5. **Agent 0**: Next highest value is item 6, but it's taken. Next is item 5 (value 35).
6. **Agent 1**: Next highest value is item 7, but it's taken. Next is item 4 (value 68).
7. **Agent 2**: Next highest value is item 5, but it's taken. Next is item 3 (value 72).
8. **Agent 3**: Next highest value is item 7, but it's taken. Next is item 3, but it's taken. Next is item 0 (value 17).

This distribution ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and we've allocated all 8 items. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation minimizes envy by allowing each agent to receive some of their most valued items available at each step.
