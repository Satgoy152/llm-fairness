Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  63  77  12  23   5  53  64
1  79  65  31  69  88  54  94  10
2  60  93  53  24  61  58  21  60
3  39  46  43  10  40  52  25  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that considers each agent's valuation of the items, trying to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels satisfied with their allocation. One approach is to use an envy-free allocation method such as the "adjusted winner procedure" or "maximum Nash welfare" approach, but given the discrete nature of this problem (integer allocations), this can be simplified through direct calculation and observation.

Let's proceed by considering each agent's high valuation items and allocate them while ensuring no agent feels significantly disadvantaged compared to others. We can try to balance the distribution by focusing on maximizing the total perceived value for each agent.

Here is one way to allocate items:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (77) and item 0 (72), so they should receive those.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (94) and item 4 (88), so they should receive those.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (93) and item 5 (58), so they should receive those.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the highest (85) and item 3 (10), so they should receive those.

This allocation considers high-value items for each agent and attempts to balance the perceived utility. Let's summarize this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items and that their highest-valued items are prioritized to reduce envy.
