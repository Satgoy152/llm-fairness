Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  38  41  84  14  90  38  61
1  85  17  91  21  41  85  87  52
2  78  68  89  63  35  88  15  80
3  12  53  70   8  41  51  86  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of any other agent to their own. One way to approach this problem is to allocate items in such a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while maintaining balance in the number of items allocated.

Let's approach this using a simple heuristic: allocate items one by one, each time giving the item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent eventually receives two items (since we have 8 items and 4 agents).

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most (85), so allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most (68), so allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most (91), so allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (84), so allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agents 1 and 3 both value it equally (41), but Agent 3 has no items yet; allocate to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most (90), so allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most (87), but Agent 1 already has two items. Agent 3 values it second most (86), so allocate to Agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most (80), so allocate to Agent 2.

The allocations ensure each agent receives precisely two items. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint that each agent receives exactly two items, and it attempts to maximize individual agent satisfaction based on item valuations.
