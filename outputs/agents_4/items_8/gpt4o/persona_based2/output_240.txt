Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  63  60   3  10  37  74  95
1  16  66  44  11  22  55  95  25
2  93  40  38  34  38  82  60  36
3  40  71  26  93  94  48  25  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we will strive for an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 (68), 1 (63), 2 (60), 6 (74), 7 (95) highly.
- Agent 1 values items: 6 (95), 1 (66), 2 (44), 5 (55) highly.
- Agent 2 values items: 0 (93), 5 (82), 6 (60), 3 (34) highly.
- Agent 3 values items: 3 (93), 4 (94), 1 (71), 7 (86) highly.

To achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items that Agent 0 values highly, such as item 7 and item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 which is valued fairly well and not highly valued by others.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 0, since it is very highly valued by Agent 2 and less so by others.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 and item 4, as these are highly valued by Agent 3.

Considering these priorities and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items while all 8 items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Items 7, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 6, 5
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 1
- **Agent 3**: Items 3, 4

This allocation attempts to respect the highest valuations of each agent as much as possible:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives items that are among their most preferred, aiming to minimize envy and maximize fair division based on the given valuations.
