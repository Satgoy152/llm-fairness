Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  75  84  70  66  43  50  99
1  34  17  94  38  87  51   3  36
2  20  45  90  40  39  62  50  86
3  72  48  45   8  40  53  91  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One way to achieve this is by optimizing the allocation based on the agents' valuation of the items.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that aims to distribute the items as evenly and fairly as possible among the agents, considering their valuations:

1. **Assign high-value items to agents who value them the most**: This initial allocation strategy helps reduce potential envy.
2. **Balance the number of items**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and distribute them equally.
3. **Check for envy-freeness**: Adjust if needed to ensure no agent prefers another's allocation.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 and item 7 the most, so we assign these to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most, so we assign this to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most, so we assign this to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most, so we assign this to agent 3.
- Distribute the remaining items (1, 3, 4) to balance the allocation.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 7]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [1, 6]
- Agent 3: [3, 5]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's valuation based on their preferences while maintaining a fair distribution of items.
