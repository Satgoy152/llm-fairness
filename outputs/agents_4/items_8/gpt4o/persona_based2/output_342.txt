Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  19   0  81  83  76   4  64
1  69  30   7  32  29  10  69  98
2  39  34  64  47  96  14  11  30
3  23  98  54  86  15  31  30  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where each agent gets an integer number of items, we aim for a distribution that minimizes envy among agents. This is a complex problem, but we can try to achieve a reasonable solution by considering the valuations each agent has for the items.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the item with the highest valuation to the agent who values it the most.
2. Continue assigning items, while ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share and the total number of items assigned remains correct.

Let's calculate the allocation step-by-step:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (98). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (98). Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (64). Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (86). Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (96). Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (76). Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (69). Assign Item 6 to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (98). Assign Item 7 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, which should help minimize envy. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items.
