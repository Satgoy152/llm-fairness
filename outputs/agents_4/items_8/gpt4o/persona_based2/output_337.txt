Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  41  82  98  72  43  92  99
1  10  79  82   5  36  61  66  17
2  16  44   5  33  57  54  40   8
3   2  26   3  87   8  66  99   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for a solution that minimizes envy among the agents. This involves ensuring that each agent perceives their allocated set of items as at least as valuable as the allocation to any other agent. One common approach is to use the Max-Min fairness or Envy-Free (EF1) criterion, which ensures that no agent envies another once one item is removed from the more valuable bundle.

Given the valuations, let's analyze and allocate the items in a way that aims to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 (98), 7 (99), and 6 (92).
2. **Agent 1** values items 2 (82), 1 (79), and 5 (61) highly.
3. **Agent 2** has moderate valuations across items, but item 4 (57) is the highest.
4. **Agent 3** values items 6 (99), 3 (87), and 5 (66) highly.

Based on these valuations, we attempt to allocate items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 (45) and 7 (99) – Allocating item 7 gives agent 0 a highly valued item, and item 0 adds to their total value.
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 (79), 2 (82) – These are the highest valued items for agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Items 4 (57), 5 (54) – Item 4 is the highest valued for agent 2, and item 5 adds to their total.
- **Agent 3**: Items 3 (87), 6 (99) – These are high-value items for agent 3.

This allocation attempts to distribute items in a way that considers each agent's preferences while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
