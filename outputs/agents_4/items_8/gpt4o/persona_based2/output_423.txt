Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  80  67  92  60  72  27  14
1  34  13  36  34   9  18  50  63
2  73  51  67  56  19  38  64  95
3  87  89  39  34  22  86  19  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. One common approach is to use the Envy-Free up to One Good (EF1) criterion, where an allocation is considered fair if no agent envies another agent more than one item.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair division:

1. **Initial Considerations**: 
   - Each agent should get 2 items as there are 8 items and 4 agents. 
   - Aim for each agent to have a total valuation that is as close to equal as possible.

2. **Sorting by Valuation**:
   - For each item, identify the agent who values it the most.
   - Allocate items to agents based on their highest preference, ensuring no agent receives more than 2 items initially.

3. **Balancing**:
   - Adjust the allocation to ensure that the total value received by each agent is balanced.
   - Swap items between agents if it helps in achieving a more balanced valuation.

Now, following these steps, here's one possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Prefers items 1 and 3 highly.
- **Agent 1**: Prefers items 6 and 7.
- **Agent 2**: Prefers items 0 and 2.
- **Agent 3**: Prefers items 4 and 5.

Considering the above preferences and balancing total valuations, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on their preferences and ensures each agent receives items they value highly, while maintaining a balance in total valuations.
