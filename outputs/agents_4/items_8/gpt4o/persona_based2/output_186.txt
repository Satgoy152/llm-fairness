Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  51  42  10  50  94  73  94
1  61  44  14  25  63  17  42  70
2  83  99  95  75   4  29  80  78
3  74  55  23  25  62  78  35  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a method that balances the total value each agent receives. Here, I'll attempt to distribute the items so that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 37 + 51 + 42 + 10 + 50 + 94 + 73 + 94 = 451
- Agent 1: 61 + 44 + 14 + 25 + 63 + 17 + 42 + 70 = 336
- Agent 2: 83 + 99 + 95 + 75 + 4 + 29 + 80 + 78 = 543
- Agent 3: 74 + 55 + 23 + 25 + 62 + 78 + 35 + 72 = 424

Now, let's allocate the items such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as similar as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives items that they value highly compared to others.
   - Items: 5, 7
   - Total value: 94 + 94 = 188

2. **Agent 1**: Receives items that they value more than others.
   - Items: 0, 4
   - Total value: 61 + 63 = 124

3. **Agent 2**: Receives items they value significantly.
   - Items: 1, 2
   - Total value: 99 + 95 = 194

4. **Agent 3**: Receives the remaining items.
   - Items: 3, 6
   - Total value: 25 + 35 = 60

This distribution attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives, based on their own valuations. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

Note that this allocation might not be perfectly envy-free, but it aims to minimize envy by maximizing the perceived value each agent receives.
