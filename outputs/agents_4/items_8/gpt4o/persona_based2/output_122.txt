Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  40  84  90  65  26  48  16
1  80  77  46  10  71  13  11  49
2  22  41  93  89  10  87  62  33
3   9   2  18  85  20  63  17  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that we aim for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

A common approach is to use a method known as "sequential allocation," where agents take turns picking their most preferred available item based on their valuations until all items are allocated. However, given the limited number of agents and items, we can attempt to manually allocate items to achieve a balanced distribution of total valuations.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 0. We can allocate items 2 and 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4. Since item 0 is already allocated, we can allocate items 1 and 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2 and 5. Item 2 is already allocated, so we can allocate items 5 and 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for item 3. We can allocate items 3 and 7 to Agent 3 to balance the allocation.

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on agents' preferences while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share in terms of total valuation.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

Each agent receives two items, and all eight items are allocated. This allocation considers the individual preferences and attempts to ensure that each agent perceives the allocation as fair based on their valuations.
