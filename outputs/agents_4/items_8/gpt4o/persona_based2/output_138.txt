Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12   9  61  60  81  76  18  98
1  34   3  58  51  75  59  75  65
2  62  34  89  23  13  18  54  54
3  38   9  68  59  36  39  98  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we will aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items. The goal of an envy-free allocation is to ensure that no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 7 highest at 98, so we can start by allocating item 7 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values items 4 and 6 equally at 75, but since allocating item 6 to agent 1 will allow us to balance the allocations among all agents better, we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 highest at 89, so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 highest at 98, but since item 6 is already allocated, we allocate item 0 to agent 3, which is the second-highest valued item for them at 38.

Now we have four items allocated, and we need to distribute the remaining four items:

5. **Agent 0** can be allocated item 5, which they value at 76.
6. **Agent 1** can be allocated item 3, which they value at 51.
7. **Agent 2** can be allocated item 1, which they value at 34.
8. **Agent 3** can be allocated item 4, which they value at 36.

This allocation tries to balance the value each agent receives considering their preferences, achieving a distribution that minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and all items are assigned exactly once.
