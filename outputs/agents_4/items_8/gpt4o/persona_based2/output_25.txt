Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  24  74  16  40  41  40  54
1  31  86  29  82  97  44  83  33
2  75  78  67  46  89   8  27  56
3  55  46  97  71  90  34  30  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to achieve a fair distribution that minimizes envy, although perfect envy-freeness isn't always possible with indivisible items.

One reasonable approach is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent, which can help in reducing envy. Let's analyze the valuations and attempt an allocation:

### Valuations Table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 6      | 24     | 74     | 16     | 40     | 41     | 40     | 54     |
| 1     | 31     | 86     | 29     | 82     | 97     | 44     | 83     | 33     |
| 2     | 75     | 78     | 67     | 46     | 89     | 8      | 27     | 56     |
| 3     | 55     | 46     | 97     | 71     | 90     | 34     | 30     | 91     |

### Strategy:

1. **Identify High Valuation Items:** Assign items where agents have significantly higher valuations than others.
2. **Balance the Number of Items:** Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, considering their highest valuations.
3. **Iterate and Adjust:** Fine-tune the allocation to balance the total value each agent receives.

### Allocation Plan:

- **Agent 0:** Prefers item 2. 
- **Agent 1:** Prefers item 4.
- **Agent 2:** Prefers item 0.
- **Agent 3:** Prefers item 7.

Allocate these items first and then distribute remaining items.

### Allocation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3.

Now, distribute the remaining items (1, 3, 5, 6):

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (2nd highest valuation for Agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items and maximize the valuation for each agent, given the constraints.
