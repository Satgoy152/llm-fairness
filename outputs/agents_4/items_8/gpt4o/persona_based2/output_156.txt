Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  84  34  62  16  99   1  16
1  20  40  93  27  45  75  48  42
2  85  49  87  55  98  67  34  19
3  77  59  74  13  83  90  19  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. An allocation is envy-free if every agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. However, given the discrete nature of items and the fact that valuations are not necessarily uniform or additive, achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations may not always be possible. Instead, we aim to minimize envy and ensure a fair distribution by considering the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's first analyze the given valuations:

- **Agent 0's Valuations:** [61, 84, 34, 62, 16, 99, 1, 16]
- **Agent 1's Valuations:** [20, 40, 93, 27, 45, 75, 48, 42]
- **Agent 2's Valuations:** [85, 49, 87, 55, 98, 67, 34, 19]
- **Agent 3's Valuations:** [77, 59, 74, 13, 83, 90, 19, 64]

Next, we will allocate the items considering the highest valuations for each agent and trying to ensure each agent gets a valuable allocation.

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 the most (99).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (93).
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (98).
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 second most (90), but item 0 is their next highest unique item (77).

Now, let's allocate items:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (highest value) and item 1 (next highest value not already taken).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (highest value).
- Agent 2 gets item 4 (highest value) and item 6 (next highest value not already taken).
- Agent 3 gets item 0 (highest unique value) and item 3 (next highest value not already taken).

This allocation gives each agent a set of items they value highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible, given the constraints, by focusing on each agent's highest valuations and ensuring all items are distributed.
