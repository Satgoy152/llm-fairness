Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  15  54  96  73  78  45  53
1  74  82  49  54  35  51  91  98
2  35  46  67  43   6  62  66  40
3  52  66  17   8  66  67  31  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
The goal is to allocate the items to the agents in a way that is as fair as possible, ideally achieving an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel that their bundle of items is at least as good as any other agent's bundle based on their valuation. 

To approach this problem, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives and ensure that all agents receive items, given there are 8 items and 4 agents. Each agent should ideally receive 2 items to ensure a balanced distribution.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's highest values are for items 3 (96) and 5 (78).
- Agent 1's highest values are for items 7 (98) and 1 (82).
- Agent 2's highest values are for items 2 (67) and 6 (66).
- Agent 3's highest values are for items 5 (67) and 1 (66).

A potential allocation could be:

1. Allocate item 3 and item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 1 and item 7 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 2 and item 6 to Agent 2.
4. Allocate item 0 and item 4 to Agent 3.

This allocation tries to respect the preferences of each agent by giving them items they value highly. Let's verify:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 5, which they value at 96 and 78.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 7, which they value at 82 and 98.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 6, which they value at 67 and 66.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 4, which they value at 52 and 66.

Now, let's format this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed across the 4 agents.
