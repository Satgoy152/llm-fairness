Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  33  23  86  62  99  83  17
1  70  76  55   8  63  98  44  38
2  38  57  85  51   3  13  99  29
3  14  73  10  73  49  75  52  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation where possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraint of integer allocations and the need to allocate all items, we will proceed with the following strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** We'll first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their overall preference strength.

2. **Assign Items Based on Valuation:** We aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a set of items maximizing their total value while considering envy-freeness. 

3. **Iterative Allocation:** We'll iterate through the items, assigning them to the agent who values them the most if it doesn't create an envy situation.

Here's the detailed step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 5 highly (99) and item 3 (86). We'll allocate these two items to agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 1 highly (76) and item 0 (70). We'll allocate these two items to agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 6 highly (99) and also has high value for item 2 (85). We'll allocate these two items to agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Left with items 4 and 7, which they value reasonably (49 and 45). We'll allocate these two items to agent 3.

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, with a balanced distribution of items among them.
