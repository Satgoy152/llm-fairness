Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  51  38  83  10  99   8  23
1  74  72  35  81  83  25  44  21
2  81  25  88  99  40  50  38  22
3  88  38  44  52  92   9   3  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy, although achieving complete envy-freeness is very challenging in practice with discrete items. A reasonable approach is to use a round-robin or balanced method to distribute the items based on the agents' preferences. Here's one way we could allocate the items:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent will receive 2 items since there are 8 items and 4 agents.

2. **Prioritize High Value Items:**
   - Start by allocating the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most.

3. **Assign Items:**
   - **Item 3**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (99) -> Allocate to Agent 2.
   - **Item 5**: Valued highest by Agent 0 (99) -> Allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 4**: Valued highest by Agent 3 (92) -> Allocate to Agent 3.
   - **Item 0**: Valued highest by Agent 3 (88) -> Allocate to Agent 3.
   - **Item 7**: Valued highest by Agent 3 (95) -> Already 2 items allocated to Agent 3, choose next high value for others.
   - **Item 7**: Next highest valuation by Agent 1 (21) -> Allocate to Agent 1.
   - **Item 1**: Valued highest by Agent 0 (51) -> Allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 2**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (88) -> Allocate to Agent 2.
   - **Item 6**: Remaining item valued highest by Agent 1 (44) -> Allocate to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [4, 0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 7 and 6.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 2.
- Agent 3 receives items 4 and 0.

This distribution attempts to fairly allocate items based on each agent's highest preferences while ensuring every agent receives exactly 2 items.
