Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  63  68  21  86  55  44  17
1  76  62  83   8  23  82  49  32
2  11  61  57  81  78  82  79  99
3  80  58  36  96   1  15  33  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among agents. Envy-freeness implies that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Total Value per Agent**: Sum the values each agent assigns to all items to understand their total perceived value:
   - Agent 0: 60 + 63 + 68 + 21 + 86 + 55 + 44 + 17 = 414
   - Agent 1: 76 + 62 + 83 + 8 + 23 + 82 + 49 + 32 = 415
   - Agent 2: 11 + 61 + 57 + 81 + 78 + 82 + 79 + 99 = 548
   - Agent 3: 80 + 58 + 36 + 96 + 1 + 15 + 33 + 80 = 399

2. **Allocate Items**: Distribute items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value, aiming to balance the total value among them as much as possible:
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 (96), so assign item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 2 values item 7 the most (99), so assign item 7 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (86), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (83), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Now allocate remaining items by checking the next highest valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Final Allocation**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated:
   - Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
   - Agent 1: Items 1 and 2
   - Agent 2: Items 5 and 7
   - Agent 3: Items 3 and 6

Final allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
