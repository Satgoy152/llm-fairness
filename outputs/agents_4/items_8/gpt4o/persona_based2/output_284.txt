Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20   3  94  74  99  28  58  58
1  60   9  40  95  34  48  81  78
2  79  82  35  57  24  95   7  92
3  71  57  56  37   0  44  67  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a fair manner, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a roughly equal share of total value from their perspective while also ensuring that all items are allocated. We can use the method of "Envy-Free Rounding" or "Max-Min Fair Share" as a guideline, but due to the discrete nature of the problem and integer constraints, a perfect envy-free allocation might not be possible. Instead, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible under the circumstances.

Let's start by considering potential allocations based on maximizing each agentâ€™s value received, and then adjust to ensure fairness and completeness.

### Initial Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (99), followed by item 2 (94).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (95), followed by item 6 (81).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (95), followed by item 7 (92).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (71), followed by item 2 (56).

### Proposed Fair Allocation

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items 2 and 4. Total value = 193.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items 3 and 6. Total value = 176.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items 5 and 7. Total value = 187.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items 0 and 1. Total value = 128.

### Allocation Check

- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 4] - Values (94, 99)
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 6] - Values (95, 81)
- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 7] - Values (95, 92)
- **Agent 3**: Items [0, 1] - Values (71, 57)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items, and the total number of items allocated is 8. Each agent receives two items, aiming for a balance in individual perceived value.

### Final JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the values across agents as evenly as possible given the constraints, ensuring that no agent is entirely without high-value items relative to their preferences.
