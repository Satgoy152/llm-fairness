Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  94  84  59   8  92  79  29
1  80  52   9  13  17  29  17   4
2  19  31   6  91  41  53  66  38
3  44  49  45  95   1  58  79  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction in a way that minimizes envy among agents. An envy-free allocation would mean that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Given the complexity of achieving true envy-freeness, especially in small discrete allocations, we can aim for a fair division that seeks to balance the total value each agent receives according to their valuations. One approach could be to attempt to maximize the minimum satisfaction across agents, often referred to as a "maximin" strategy.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations on items 0, 1, and 5. Allocating these items to Agent 0 ensures they receive a high total value.

2. **Agent 1** has fairly low valuations across the board, but item 0 and 1 are valued relatively higher for them compared to other items. However, we have given these to Agent 0. Therefore, allocate less competitive items to them, such as items 2 and 6, which have the next highest valuations for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 3 highly. Allocating item 3 to Agent 2 gives them a significant portion of their utility.

4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest, but since it's already given to Agent 2, we assign items 6 and 7, which are among the highest remaining values for them.

Using this reasoning, let's form the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 6, 7

This allocation attempts to balance out the valuations each agent receives.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```
