Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  71  55  48   6  91  56  93
1  46  93   3  72  80  98  31  84
2  75  71  38  34  11  60  86  95
3  20  89  76  96  18  55  47  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize their satisfaction. A common approach to fair division is to use algorithms like the "round robin" or "maximum Nash welfare," but given the constraints and the request for a simple allocation, I'll provide a manual allocation that seeks to balance the valuations across agents.

Here's the allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 7 the highest at 93, and item 5 at 91. Assigning these high-value items to agent 0 will maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 the highest at 98, and item 1 at 93. Assigning these high-value items to agent 1 will maximize their satisfaction. However, since item 5 was assigned to agent 0, we will allocate item 1 and another high-value item to this agent. Item 3 is valued at 72, which is a good option.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 7 the highest at 95, and item 6 at 86. Assigning these high-value items to agent 2 will maximize their satisfaction. But since item 7 was assigned to agent 0, we will allocate item 6 and another high-value item, such as item 0 valued at 75, to this agent.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 the highest at 96. Since item 3 was assigned to agent 1, we will allocate another high-value item, such as item 2 valued at 76, and another item like item 4 valued at 18, to this agent.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. We have allocated items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 6, 0
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4

All 8 items are now allocated, and each agent receives two items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
