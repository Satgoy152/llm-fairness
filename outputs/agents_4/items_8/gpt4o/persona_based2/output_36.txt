Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  49  49  84  83  34   5  32
1  12   3  14  38  19  61  95   0
2  73  42   5  52  27  18  11  56
3  25  79  75  42  59  97  28  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents according to their valuations, we aim to minimize envy among the agents. This means each agent should feel that they are at least as well off with their allocation as with any other agent's allocation. A common strategy for achieving this is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility, or in simpler terms, ensuring that the least happy agent is as happy as possible.

Given the valuations matrix, we will use a heuristic method to allocate items:

1. Start by analyzing each agent's highest valued items.
2. Try to give each agent some of their highest valued items while ensuring that all items are distributed.
3. Balance the allocation by ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and adjust to promote fairness.

Here's the allocation process:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest, significantly more than other items. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the highest. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest, but it is already taken. Their next highest is item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign the remaining items in a way that balances the allocations for fairness:
  - Agent 0: Assign items 1 and 2.
  - Agent 1: Assign item 4.
  - Agent 3: Assign items 7.

Now, each agent has been assigned items, and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives some of their higher-valued items while distributing all items fairly.
