Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3   2  50  12  70  97  59  21
1  91  96  36  29  61  74  63  74
2  35   6  78  90  10   7  27  99
3  25  34  94  60  83  51  47  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. Envy-freeness means that every agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent, based on their own valuations.

We'll use the following approach:

1. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation for the items they receive.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
3. Try to minimize envy by comparing the total valuation of items received by each agent.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (97)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (70)
   - We assign Items 5 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (96)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (91)
   - We assign Items 1 and 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 7 (99)
   - We assign Item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (94)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (83) - but already allocated
   - Third highest: Item 3 (60)
   - We assign Items 2 and 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining items**: 
   - Item 6 remains unallocated.

Upon reconsideration, it is better to reallocate to ensure all items are allocated. Let's adjust:

- Reallocate Item 6 to Agent 2, who values it more than Agent 0.

Now, each agent has the following items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 4, 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1
- **Agent 2**: Items 6, 7
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 3

This allocation respects integer division and attempts to align with the highest individual valuations, thus reducing envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
