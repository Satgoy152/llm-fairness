Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  73  83  18  88  10  46  63
1  53  73  73  95  11  45  25  95
2  59  27  88  79  32  34  49  96
3   2   8  78  91  92  47  18  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share of items based on their valuations. This can be challenging, but we'll try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value, minimizing envy.

First, let's look at the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 96 + 73 + 83 + 18 + 88 + 10 + 46 + 63 = 477
- Agent 1: 53 + 73 + 73 + 95 + 11 + 45 + 25 + 95 = 470
- Agent 2: 59 + 27 + 88 + 79 + 32 + 34 + 49 + 96 = 464
- Agent 3: 2 + 8 + 78 + 91 + 92 + 47 + 18 + 74 = 410

Next, let's try to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. We can start by assigning items where the valuation is highest for each agent, ensuring that no two agents get the same item.

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Item 0 (value 96)
   - Item 4 (value 88)

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Item 3 (value 95)
   - Item 7 (value 95)

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Item 2 (value 88)
   - Item 6 (value 49)

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Item 5 (value 47)
   - Item 1 (value 8)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly relative to others. Let's verify that all items are allocated:

- Items allocated: 0, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6, 5, 1 (All 8 items are allocated)

Finally, here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible based on the given valuations, keeping envy to a minimum.
