Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  48   8  43  81  80  86  84
1  70  17  51   5  51   9   0  22
2  42  75  21   9  32  84   8  53
3  50  86  66  59  39  36  39  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to aim for envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations, we should try to distribute the items in a way that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** Highest values are for items 4 (81), 5 (80), 6 (86), and 7 (84).
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** Highest values are for items 0 (70), 2 (51), and 4 (51).
3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** Highest values are for items 1 (75), 5 (84), and 7 (53).
4. **Agent 3's Valuations:** Highest values are for items 1 (86), 2 (66), and 3 (59).

Given these preferences, let's aim to allocate the items to minimize envy:

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3, as it has the highest value for them.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for them.
  
Now, let's allocate the remaining items while considering the remaining preferences:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (second-highest value).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 (second-highest value).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (next highest value).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to respect the highest preferences of the agents while distributing the items evenly. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is made considering the highest values each agent has for the items.
