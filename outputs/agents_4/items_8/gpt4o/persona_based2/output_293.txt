Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  38  87  27   8  23  13  41
1  71   6  99  17  77  52  64  18
2  29  70  73  83  20  87  13  56
3  55   0  17  47  76  30  37  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [55  0 17 47 76 30 37 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution that is as envy-free as possible. In an envy-free allocation, each agent should feel that their share is at least as good as any other agent's share, given their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (87).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (99).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (87).
- Agent 3 values item 7 the most (90).

Given these preferences and the need for fairness, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations. Below is a possible envy-free allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 since it is their highest valued item and is highly valued by others as well.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 as it is their highest valued item.
3. Assign item 7 to Agent 3 as it is their highest valued item.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since it's one of their higher valued items not yet assigned.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 since it is the second highest valued item for them.
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as a complement to item 0.
7. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 as it helps balance their allocation.
8. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 as it complements their allocation.

This allocation is designed to balance the distribution of value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
