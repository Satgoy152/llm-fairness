Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  95  85  53  32  38  78  71
1  52  99  88  37  64  90  78  88
2  25  29  91  46  42  64  23  27
3  58  84  53  95  34  77  12  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. We aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

```
Valuations:
Agent 0: [55, 95, 85, 53, 32, 38, 78, 71]
Agent 1: [52, 99, 88, 37, 64, 90, 78, 88]
Agent 2: [25, 29, 91, 46, 42, 64, 23, 27]
Agent 3: [58, 84, 53, 95, 34, 77, 12, 74]
```

To ensure a fair division, we could use a strategy that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives. This requires examining which items are most valued by each agent and distributing them accordingly.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly (95), so we assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 highly (90), so we assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 highly (91), so we assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly (95), so we assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we allocate the remaining items while maintaining balance:

5. **Agent 0** can take item 0, which is valued at 55, adding to their total valuation.
6. **Agent 1** can take item 4, which is valued at 64, adding to their total valuation.
7. **Agent 2** can take item 7, which is valued at 27, adding to their total valuation.
8. **Agent 3** can take item 6, which is valued at 12, adding to their total valuation.

This allocation aims to give each agent a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.
