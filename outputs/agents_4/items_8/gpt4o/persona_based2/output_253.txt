Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92   4  88  47  43  29  26  25
1  20  41  75  88   9  37  52  71
2  99  59  42  24  43  26  60  41
3  43  20  23  64  90  82  11  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. We will aim to allocate the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value 92).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (value 88).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most, but it's already taken.
   - Next highest valued item is item 6 (value 60).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 4 the most (value 90).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution as much as possible:

5. **Agent 0** (continued):
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 88).

6. **Agent 1** (continued):
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (value 71).

7. **Agent 2** (continued):
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 59).

8. **Agent 3** (continued):
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 (value 82).

Now, each agent has been allocated items, and the total number of items allocated is 8, which meets the requirement.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
