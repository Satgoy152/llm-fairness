Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  16  23  80  90  22  59  99
1  71  15  88   5  74  47  34  78
2  97  67  84   0  71  15  31  76
3  30   3  80   5  59  74   2  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the complexity of the problem and the integer constraint on the number of items each agent can receive, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible, but we will strive for the fairest distribution.

Let's start by analyzing the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(45 + 16 + 23 + 80 + 90 + 22 + 59 + 99 = 434\)
- Agent 1: \(71 + 15 + 88 + 5 + 74 + 47 + 34 + 78 = 412\)
- Agent 2: \(97 + 67 + 84 + 0 + 71 + 15 + 31 + 76 = 441\)
- Agent 3: \(30 + 3 + 80 + 5 + 59 + 74 + 2 + 87 = 340\)

Next, we identify the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to distribute them accordingly while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share based on their total valuation.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valued items - 7 (99), 4 (90), 3 (80)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valued items - 2 (88), 0 (71), 4 (74)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valued items - 0 (97), 2 (84), 7 (76)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valued items - 7 (87), 5 (74), 2 (80)

Given these preferences, let's try to allocate items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items [3, 4] - Total value = 170
- **Agent 1**: Assign items [0, 2] - Total value = 159
- **Agent 2**: Assign items [1, 7] - Total value = 143
- **Agent 3**: Assign items [5, 6] - Total value = 76

Checking the allocation, each agent has at least two items, and the distribution attempts to respect their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and while not perfectly envy-free due to the integer constraint, it aims to minimize dissatisfaction.
