Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  58  36  34  85  57  87  91
1   6  27  61  96  70  45  98  96
2  87   6  54  47  46  84  24  21
3   9  35  22  31  78  34  42  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the four agents, we aim to use principles of fair division, such as maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, minimizing envy among agents, and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this context, it is important to consider both the individual valuations of items by each agent and the overall distribution of value.

Given the provided valuations, a potential approach is to use the "round-robin" method or "envy-free" allocation strategies. However, since we are not specifically bound by strict envy-freeness or proportionality in this problem, we can focus on a balanced allocation that attempts to maximize the minimum value received by each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item when possible.

Let's explore a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values items 0, 1, 5, and 6 highly.
2. **Agent 1** places high value on items 2, 3, 6, and 7.
3. **Agent 2** values items 0, 5, and 2 highly.
4. **Agent 3** places high value on items 4, 7, and 5.

By considering these preferences, we can attempt to allocate items as follows:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, who values it highly.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, who has a high valuation for it.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, also highly valued.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3, who values it highly.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2, as they have a significant valuation for it.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0, who values it highly.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 3, who values it highly.

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of high-value items among the agents, taking into account their individual valuations. Each agent receives a fair number of items relative to their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
