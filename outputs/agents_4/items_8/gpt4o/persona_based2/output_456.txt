Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  37  49  97  47  82  97  40
1  41  71  19  73  57  45  40  79
2  85  91  54  37  37   3  93  66
3  15  85  48  45  89  24  95  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's begin by examining the valuations to identify potential allocations that minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 and item 6 highly (both valued at 97).
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (valued at 71).
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 and item 6 the most (valued at 91 and 93, respectively).
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 and item 7 the most (valued at 95 each).

Considering these preferences, we can try to allocate items in such a way to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Given their strong preference for high-value items, allocate items 3 and 6.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1, which is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 and item 2, accommodating their high valuation for these items.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 4, 5, and 7, aligning with their preference for item 7 and providing a fair distribution given the other allocations.

Let's verify this allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 6, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 gets item 1, which is their top choice.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 2, both of which have favorable valuations for them.
- Agent 3 receives items 4, 5, and 7, ensuring they get highly valued items.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4, 5, 7]
}
```

Please note that these allocations do not guarantee absolute envy-freeness due to the complexity of individual preferences and the constraint of integer allocations, but they aim to balance the relative satisfaction of each agent given their valuations.
