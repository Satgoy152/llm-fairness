Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  53  71  61  24   4  72  49
1   9  60  64  33  52  85  93  81
2  48  18  73  66  64  45  30   1
3  64  88  81  28  89  51  39  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the preferences of each agent for the items based on their valuations. One common approach is to apply a method similar to the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or use a "Greedy Allocation" focusing on maximizing the minimum value received by each agent.

Let's analyze the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  53  71  61  24   4  72  49
1   9  60  64  33  52  85  93  81
2  48  18  73  66  64  45  30   1
3  64  88  81  28  89  51  39  57
```

An effective strategy is to assign items iteratively, considering each agent's highest-valued items and avoiding situations where an agent would envy another's allocation. We can try to balance out the total valuation received by each agent.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 1 (88). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 6 (93). Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 2 (71). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (66). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 3**: Next highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 4 (89). Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 0**: Next highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 7 (49). Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1**: Next highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 5 (85). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
8. **Agent 2**: Only item left is item 0 (48). Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and aims for an envy-free distribution. Each agent's allocation includes items they highly value, reducing the likelihood of envy.
