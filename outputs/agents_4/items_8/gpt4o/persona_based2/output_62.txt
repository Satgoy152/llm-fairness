Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  31  38  64   0  44  86  17
1  38  45   2  48  12  74  77  91
2  96  48  23  88   3  58  79  26
3  22  37  25  95  83   9  31  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

One approach to achieve a fair division is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) method, which maximizes the product of utilities. This approach tends to balance efficiency and fairness, making it a strong candidate for achieving envy-freeness or minimizing envy.

Given the valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 0, 3, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 7 the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest, but since Agent 0 also highly values it, we look for other high-value items for Agent 2, like item 3 and 6.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest, but since it conflicts with Agent 0 and 2, we look for other significant values, such as item 4 and 7.

Letâ€™s try to allocate the items based on these insights:

- **Agent 0:** Allocate items 0 and 6.
- **Agent 1:** Allocate items 5 and 7.
- **Agent 2:** Allocate items 2 and 3.
- **Agent 3:** Allocate items 1 and 4.

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring every item is allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, aiming to minimize envy.
