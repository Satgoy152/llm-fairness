Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  54  58  16  65  27  28  34
1  89  90  61   5  33  69   5   9
2  67  74  38  36  95  69  50  56
3  54  34   4  47  75  55  59  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the distribution is as equitable as possible. A common principle used in fair division is envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We'll aim to satisfy this principle as best as possible given the constraints.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 4 and 2 the highest (65 and 58, respectively).
- Agent 1 values items 1 and 0 the highest (90 and 89, respectively).
- Agent 2 values items 4 and 1 the highest (95 and 74, respectively).
- Agent 3 values items 4 and 6 the highest (75 and 59, respectively).

A direct envy-free allocation might be challenging due to overlapping high valuations, but we can try to minimize potential envy by ensuring each agent gets items they value highly.

Allocation strategy:
1. Assign each agent their highest valued item first, if possible.
2. Consider secondary items for each agent that do not significantly disadvantage others.

Here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 0
  - Values: 58 (item 2), 46 (item 0)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 3
  - Values: 90 (item 1), 5 (item 3)
- **Agent 2**: Items 4, 5
  - Values: 95 (item 4), 69 (item 5)
- **Agent 3**: Items 6, 7
  - Values: 59 (item 6), 55 (item 7)

This allocation attempts to balance the interests of each agent, giving them high-value items while ensuring that each agent receives a plausible share of the total value. Agent 1 gets item 1, which they value the highest, and a lower-valued item 3, which helps keep balance. Similarly, agent 3 doesn't get item 4, their highest, but gets two reasonable items (6 and 7).

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```
