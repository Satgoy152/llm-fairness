Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  20  37  11  68  93  34  89
1  72  10  37  19  83  41  77   5
2  32  57   2  92  99   0  40  16
3  97  84  22  33  13  62  20  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and distributes items equitably based on the given valuations. Let's consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to balance the allocations.

We have the following valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [96, 20, 37, 11, 68, 93, 34, 89]
- Agent 1: [72, 10, 37, 19, 83, 41, 77, 5]
- Agent 2: [32, 57, 2, 92, 99, 0, 40, 16]
- Agent 3: [97, 84, 22, 33, 13, 62, 20, 76]

To allocate the items, I'll try to assign each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. 

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (96), 5 (93)
   - Allocate items: 0, 5

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 4 (83), 6 (77)
   - Allocate items: 4, 6

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 4 (99), 3 (92)
   - Allocate items: 3, 7 (since item 4 is taken, next high value is for item 7)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (97), 1 (84)
   - Allocate items: 1, 2 (since item 0 is taken, next high value is for item 2)

Let's ensure all items are allocated:

- Items allocated to Agent 0: [0, 5]
- Items allocated to Agent 1: [4, 6]
- Items allocated to Agent 2: [3, 7]
- Items allocated to Agent 3: [1, 2]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and that the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
