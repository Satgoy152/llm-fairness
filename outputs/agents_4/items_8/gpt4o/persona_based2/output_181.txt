Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  99  72  34  72  32   4  57
1  93  60  94  48  11  34  67  28
2  36  25  73  35  36  74  17  97
3  56  44  58  71  71  87   3  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations. 

We start by examining the table of valuations:

```
Agent 0: [52, 99, 72, 34, 72, 32, 4, 57]
Agent 1: [93, 60, 94, 48, 11, 34, 67, 28]
Agent 2: [36, 25, 73, 35, 36, 74, 17, 97]
Agent 3: [56, 44, 58, 71, 71, 87, 3, 53]
```

A potential approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to use a method such as the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that is still available. However, given the complexity and need for computational fairness, we can also consider other strategies, like maximizing the minimum satisfaction or using optimization methods.

Let's try to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations:

1. **Identify Highest Valued Items**: 
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (99)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (94)
   - Agent 2: Item 7 (97)
   - Agent 3: Item 5 (87)

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Item 1
   - Agent 1: Item 2
   - Agent 2: Item 7
   - Agent 3: Item 5

Remaining items: 0, 3, 4, 6

3. **Second Round Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (52)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (67)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (36)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 (71)

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 0
- Agent 1: Items 2, 6
- Agent 2: Items 7, 4
- Agent 3: Items 5, 3

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items and attempts to balance the allocation based on their highest preferred items.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```
