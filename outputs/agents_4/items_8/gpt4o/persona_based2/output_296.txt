Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  44  80  79  64   4  80  69
1  14  13   7  97  85  93  81  37
2  53   1  59  12   4  96  22   7
3  30  25  82  60  21  58  49  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we aim to maximize fairness based on the given valuations, potentially using concepts like envy-freeness. We will attempt to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation, if possible, or at least minimize such envy. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items being allocated.

First, let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** seems to highly value items 0, 2, 3, and 6.
- **Agent 1** highly values items 3, 4, and 5.
- **Agent 2** highly values items 5 and 2.
- **Agent 3** highly values items 2 and 7.

Given these preferences, we can try to allocate items to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and every item is allocated.

A proposed allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 6] (Values: 77, 80)
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 5] (Values: 97, 93)
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 1] (Values: 59, 1)
- **Agent 3**: Items [4, 7] (Values: 21, 97)

This allocation considers high-value items for each agent and distributes them to minimize envy. Let's ensure all items are accounted for and the allocation is balanced:

- Agent 0: Total value = 77 + 80 = 157
- Agent 1: Total value = 97 + 93 = 190
- Agent 2: Total value = 59 + 1 = 60
- Agent 3: Total value = 21 + 97 = 118

With this allocation, each agent gets two items, and we've distributed all eight items. 

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while considering their preferences.
