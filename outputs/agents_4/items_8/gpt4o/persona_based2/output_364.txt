Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  70  20  14  78   1  47  71
1  36  15  33  29  57  53  73  75
2  55  41  44  99  48  72  98  85
3  70  73  94  13  34  20  61  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while attempting to minimize envy, we can use an approach that considers each agent's valuations for the items. One method to achieve fairness is to utilize the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of utilities across all agents. However, given the constraints of integer allocations, we will aim to allocate items in a way that attempts to balance the valuations each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations**:
    - There are 4 agents and 8 items, meaning on average each agent should receive 2 items.
    - We will aim to maximize the sum of the valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an approximately fair share.

2. **Allocating Items**:
    - Start by allocating items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring each agent receives an approximately equal number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

3. **Fairness Considerations**:
    - Try to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation by balancing the total valuation of items each agent receives.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valued items are 0 (83) and 4 (78).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valued items are 7 (75) and 6 (73).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valued items are 3 (99) and 6 (98). However, item 6 is already taken by agent 1, so allocate item 5 (72) instead.
- **Agent 3**: Highest valued items are 2 (94) and 1 (73). However, item 1 is already taken by agent 0, so allocate item 1 (73) instead.

Based on this, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations while respecting the integer constraint and ensuring that all 8 items are allocated.
