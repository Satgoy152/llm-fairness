Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  99  66  55  27  13  26   6
1  96  58  54   5   0  77  69  33
2  11  72  42  22  15  75  89  56
3  11  20  85  95  51  73  95  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels satisfied with their share based on their individual valuations. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness with discrete items and integer allocations, we'll strive for a solution that minimizes envy.

Let's evaluate a reasonable allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent has different preferences and values for each item.
   - We have 4 agents and 8 items, so each agent should ideally receive 2 items.
   
2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items such that the total value for each agent is maximized based on their preferences, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

3. **Allocations:**
   - **Agent 0:** Prefers item 1 (99) and item 2 (66) most.
   - **Agent 1:** Prefers item 0 (96) and item 5 (77) most.
   - **Agent 2:** Prefers item 6 (89) and item 5 (75) most.
   - **Agent 3:** Prefers item 6 (95) and item 3 (95) most.

4. **Potential Conflicts:**
   - Item 5 is valued highly by both Agent 1 and Agent 2.
   - Item 6 is valued highly by both Agent 2 and Agent 3.
   
5. **Resolution:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 as they have a unique high value for it.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3 as they have a very high value for it and an additional unique preference for item 3.
   - Adjust remaining allocations to balance the items fairly.

**Final Allocations:**
- **Agent 0:** Items 1 and 2
- **Agent 1:** Items 0 and 4
- **Agent 2:** Items 5 and 7
- **Agent 3:** Items 3 and 6

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items they highly value, striving for a fair and envy-minimized allocation.
