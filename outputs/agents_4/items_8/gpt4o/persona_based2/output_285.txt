Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  87  25   6  89  81  60  44
1  61  81  76  66  62  29  10  98
2  26  29  13   3  16  59   1  65
3  65  26  63  74  35  26   3  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a basic approach that aims to balance the total value each agent receives. One way to achieve a relatively envy-free allocation is through the "round-robin" method or other similar heuristic methods, but given the need for a computational approach, we can employ a strategy that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual preferences.

Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum up the values the agents assign to all items to understand their overall valuation tendency.

2. **Assign Items Based on Individual Value**: Allocate items one by one based on the highest value an agent assigns to an unallocated item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If necessary, adjust the allocation to ensure each agent is as satisfied as possible according to their total potential valuation.

Below is the step-by-step allocation based on this concept:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Preferences**:
   - Agent 0: [79, 87, 25, 6, 89, 81, 60, 44]
   - Agent 1: [61, 81, 76, 66, 62, 29, 10, 98]
   - Agent 2: [26, 29, 13, 3, 16, 59, 1, 65]
   - Agent 3: [65, 26, 63, 74, 35, 26, 3, 35]

2. **Allocation Process**:
   - **Round 1**: Assign the highest value item to each agent one by one.
     - Agent 0: Takes item 4 (value 89)
     - Agent 1: Takes item 7 (value 98)
     - Agent 2: Takes item 5 (value 59)
     - Agent 3: Takes item 3 (value 74)

   - **Round 2**: Remaining items [0, 1, 2, 6].
     - Agent 0: Takes item 1 (value 87)
     - Agent 1: Takes item 2 (value 76)
     - Agent 2: Takes item 6 (value 1)
     - Agent 3: Takes item 0 (value 65)

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - After rounding and adjustments, the items are allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the overall valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
