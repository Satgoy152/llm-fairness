Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  94  39  32   9  73  37  67
1  77  79  19  19  50  26  21  45
2  46   7  11  61  98  84  39   9
3  25  58  17  60  26   6  93  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item and try to distribute the items such that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Letâ€™s consider a method to allocate these items:
1. Calculate the total value for each agent by summing their valuations for all items.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that attempts to balance these total values and minimize envy.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: 416
- Agent 1: 336
- Agent 2: 355
- Agent 3: 299

We will allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is roughly balanced:

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0:** Given its high total valuation, allocate items with higher values for this agent.
2. **Agent 1:** Balance between medium and high value items.
3. **Agent 2:** Mix of high and low value items.
4. **Agent 3:** Allocate items with somewhat balanced values considering their lower total valuation.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** [0, 1] (65, 94) - Total = 159
- **Agent 1:** [4, 7] (50, 45) - Total = 95
- **Agent 2:** [3, 5] (61, 84) - Total = 145
- **Agent 3:** [2, 6] (17, 93) - Total = 110

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation tries to minimize envy by distributing items such that the total valuation each agent has of their received items is somewhat balanced given their initial valuation preferences.
