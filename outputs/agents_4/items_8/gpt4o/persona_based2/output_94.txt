Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  77  41  43  58   4  19  36
1  46  78   3  67  62  32  80  11
2  41   9  26  53  64  15  76  52
3  60  69  83  43  88  90  69  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations. Given the matrix of valuations, we can analyze the preferences and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value relatively more compared to others.

First, we will analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (73) and 1 (77).
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 (78) and 6 (80).
- **Agent 2** values item 6 (76) the most, followed by item 4 (64).
- **Agent 3** values item 5 (90) the highest, followed by item 4 (88) and item 7 (89).

Now let's make allocations trying to respect these preferences and aiming for envy-freeness.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that they value highly and are less valued by others compared to their top preferences. Item 0 (73) is a strong candidate.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6 (80) to Agent 1 as it's their highest preference.
3. **Agent 2**: As Agent 1 takes item 6, allocate item 4 (64) to Agent 2, which is their next highest preference.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 5 (90) to Agent 3, which is their highest preference.

After the initial allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [5]

Remaining items: 1, 2, 3, 7

5. **Agent 0**: Since item 1 is still available and highly valued by Agent 0 (77), allocate it.
6. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 (26) to Agent 2 as it is not highly valued by the others.
7. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 7 (89) to Agent 3 as it is highly valued by them.
8. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3 (67) to Agent 1, completing the allocation.

Now, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [6, 3]
- Agent 2: [4, 2]
- Agent 3: [5, 7]

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
