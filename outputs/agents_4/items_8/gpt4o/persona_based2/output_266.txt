Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  33  57  40  51   6  63  44
1  99  37  93  94  49  80   6   1
2  78  44  68  37  26  22  82  32
3  60  41   1  58  59  10  77  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share, based on their personal valuations. One approach to achieve this is to use the "round-robin" method or the "maximin share" method. Let's apply a simplified approach here:

1. **Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items**:
   - Agent 0: 84 + 33 + 57 + 40 + 51 + 6 + 63 + 44 = 378
   - Agent 1: 99 + 37 + 93 + 94 + 49 + 80 + 6 + 1 = 459
   - Agent 2: 78 + 44 + 68 + 37 + 26 + 22 + 82 + 32 = 389
   - Agent 3: 60 + 41 + 1 + 58 + 59 + 10 + 77 + 59 = 365

2. **Determine the order of picking based on total valuation**:
   - The agent with the highest total valuation picks first, and so on. The order is: Agent 1, Agent 2, Agent 0, Agent 3.

3. **Allocate items using a round-robin method**:
   - Each agent picks the highest valued remaining item in their order, one at a time.

4. **Allocate items**:
   - **Agent 1**: Picks item 3 (value 94)
   - **Agent 2**: Picks item 6 (value 82)
   - **Agent 0**: Picks item 0 (value 84)
   - **Agent 3**: Picks item 6 (value 77) (Note: item 6 has already been taken by Agent 2, so pick next highest available, which is item 4 value 59)
   - **Agent 1**: Picks item 2 (value 93)
   - **Agent 2**: Picks item 0 (value 78) (Note: item 0 has already been taken by Agent 0, so pick next highest available, which is item 7 value 32)
   - **Agent 0**: Picks item 1 (value 33)
   - **Agent 3**: Picks item 5 (value 10)

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 1]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 2]
- **Agent 2**: [6, 7]
- **Agent 3**: [4, 5]

5. **Final allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a fair manner based on their valuations and preferences.
