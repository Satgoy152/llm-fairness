Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  61  45  49  27   6  14  82
1  11  85  45  28  78  58  67  53
2  17  63  40  79  42  60  72  76
3  34  12  29  97  77  70  87  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a division that respects the principle of envy-freeness as much as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation from their own perspective.

Given the valuations provided, we can use a combination of algorithms like the adjusted winner procedure or other heuristic methods to find a fair division. Since there are only 8 items and 4 agents, one potential approach is to ensure that each agent gets roughly 2 items. We will attempt to balance the total value of items each agent receives according to their valuations.

Let's start by analyzing the values and attempting to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with highest value: 7 (82), 1 (61), 3 (49)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items with highest value: 1 (85), 4 (78), 6 (67)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items with highest value: 3 (79), 7 (76), 6 (72)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items with highest value: 3 (97), 6 (87), 4 (77)

Now, let's allocate based on these preferences while trying to ensure no envy:

- **Agent 0**: Selects item 7 (82) and item 1 (61)
- **Agent 1**: Selects item 4 (78) and item 6 (67)
- **Agent 2**: Selects item 3 (79) and item 2 (40)
- **Agent 3**: Selects item 5 (70) and item 0 (34)

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent receives according to their preferences and minimizes envy across agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [5, 0]
}
```
