Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  70  23  39  63   9  44  42
1  55  70  14  11  44  93  54  60
2  20  49  69  97  52  26  21  38
3  71   4  15  29  68  75  66  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 70 23 39 63  9 44 42]
 [55 70 14 11 44 93 54 60]
 [20 49 69 97 52 26 21 38]
 [71  4 15 29 68 75 66 40]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [50, 70, 23, 39, 63, 9, 44, 42]
Agent 1: [55, 70, 14, 11, 44, 93, 54, 60]
Agent 2: [20, 49, 69, 97, 52, 26, 21, 38]
Agent 3: [71, 4, 15, 29, 68, 75, 66, 40]
```

We can employ a method that assigns items one by one to the agent who values them the most but ensures that the overall allocation remains balanced and fair. We will proceed with assigning items based on the highest value to each agent, ensuring every agent gets approximately two items, as there are 8 items and 4 agents.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Agent 3 (71)
   - Assign item 0 to agent 3.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (70) and Agent 1 (70)
   - Assign item 1 to agent 0 for balance purposes as Agent 0 has no items.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Agent 2 (69)
   - Assign item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Highest valuation: Agent 2 (97)
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Highest valuation: Agent 3 (68)
   - Assign item 4 to agent 3.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Highest valuation: Agent 1 (93)
   - Assign item 5 to agent 1.

7. **Item 6:**
   - Highest valuation: Agent 3 (66)
   - Agent 3 already has 2 items, consider next highest which is Agent 1 (54)
   - Assign item 6 to agent 1.

8. **Item 7:**
   - Highest valuation: Agent 1 (60)
   - Agent 1 already has 2 items, consider next highest which is Agent 0 (42)
   - Assign item 7 to agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly while considering each agent's highest valuations and balancing the total number of items each agent receives.
