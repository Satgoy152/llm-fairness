Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  59  75  13   4  53  23  81
1  86  63  26  89  81  22  34  24
2  11  24  19   4  62  36   8  70
3  16  55  58  25  67  38  33  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach to achieving a fair allocation is to ensure that no agent feels envy towards another agent's allocation, a concept known as envy-freeness.

In this scenario, I will use a heuristic approach to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. Given that we have 4 agents and 8 items, ideally, each agent should receive 2 items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step 1: Initial Observations
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 7.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4.

### Step 2: Allocation Process
1. **Assign most valued items:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets item 3.
   - Agent 2 gets item 7.
   - Agent 3 gets item 4.

2. **Assign remaining items based on next highest valuations:**
   - Remaining items are 1, 2, 5, 6.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 2, so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 has a fair valuation for item 5, so allocate item 5 to agent 2.
   - Agent 3 has a fair valuation for item 6, so allocate item 6 to agent 3.

### Final Allocation
After the allocation, each agent gets 2 items, and the allocation aims to reduce envy by giving each agent a high-value item based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with items that they value highly, reducing the chances of envy and providing a fair division of items.
