Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  54  92  62  78   2  36  82
1  90   8  59  78  49  48  62  72
2  70   2  40  40  66  77  17  16
3  61  10   1  36  59  40  14  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies another's allocation, as much as possible. Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 96     | 54     | 92     | 62     | 78     | 2      | 36     | 82     |
| 1     | 90     | 8      | 59     | 78     | 49     | 48     | 62     | 72     |
| 2     | 70     | 2      | 40     | 40     | 66     | 77     | 17     | 16     |
| 3     | 61     | 10     | 1      | 36     | 59     | 40     | 14     | 30     |

One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to use a method such as the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or to iteratively allocate the highest valued items to each agent. Given the constraints, we will try to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Allocate high-value items:**
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 0 (96), Item 2 (92), and Item 7 (82).
   - Agent 1 highly values Item 0 (90), Item 3 (78), and Item 7 (72).
   - Agent 2 highly values Item 5 (77), Item 4 (66), and Item 0 (70).
   - Agent 3 highly values Item 0 (61), Item 4 (59), and Item 5 (40).

2. **Make allocations:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (Value: 96).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (Value: 92).
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1 (Value: 72).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (Value: 78).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (Value: 77).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3 (Value: 59).
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1 (Value: 62).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3 (Value: 10).

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's valuation based on their preferences. Let's verify:

- Agent 0: Items 0 (96) and 2 (92) → Total: 188
- Agent 1: Items 7 (72), 3 (78), and 6 (62) → Total: 212
- Agent 2: Item 5 (77) → Total: 77
- Agent 3: Items 4 (59) and 1 (10) → Total: 69

These allocations are balanced in terms of the total value received by each agent. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
