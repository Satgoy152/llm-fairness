Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66   5  76  53  21  22   7  31
1  34  50  25  81  80   1  97  29
2  84  68  64   9  95  56  15  37
3  56  45   0  29  16   1  25  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To tackle the problem of fairly allocating items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that maintains envy-freeness to the extent possible given the constraints while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We must allocate exactly 8 items in total. 

One approach to achieving this is to use a method similar to the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division algorithms, although given the structure, a straightforward allocation that considers each agent's highest valuations might suffice.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: Highest valuations are for items 2 (76), 0 (66), and 3 (53).
- Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 6 (97), 3 (81), and 4 (80).
- Agent 2: Highest valuations are for items 4 (95), 0 (84), and 1 (68).
- Agent 3: Highest valuations are for items 7 (68), 0 (56), and 1 (45).

Considering these preferences and aiming to balance the distribution across agents, a reasonable allocation might look like this:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 0 and 2 (values: 66, 76)
- Agent 1: Allocate items 3 and 6 (values: 81, 97)
- Agent 2: Allocate items 4 and 1 (values: 95, 68)
- Agent 3: Allocate items 7 and 5 (values: 68, 1)

This allocation considers the highest value items for each agent and tries to keep the number of items balanced. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [7, 5]
}
``` 

This allocation should ensure that each agent receives at least some of the items they value highly, and the total allocation uses all 8 items.
