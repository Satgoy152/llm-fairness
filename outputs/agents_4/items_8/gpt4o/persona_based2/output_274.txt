Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  56   7  98  71  78  32   8
1  84  85  56  67  22  43  17  41
2  56   4  54  77  36  31  91  92
3   3  52  39  98  89  11  98  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we need to allocate items such that each agent feels that they received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we will aim for a solution that minimizes envy and provides balanced allocations based on the agents' valuations.

We'll analyze the valuation table and try to distribute the items such that:

1. Each agent receives at least one item.
2. The total value received by each agent is as close as possible to the others, relative to their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (98), followed by item 5 (78).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (85), followed by item 0 (84).
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (92), followed by item 6 (91).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (98), but since it is already allocated to Agent 0, we consider item 4 (89).

By considering these preferences and trying to balance the allocations, we can form the following allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items [3, 5]
2. Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
3. Agent 2: Items [6, 7]
4. Agent 3: Items [2, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
