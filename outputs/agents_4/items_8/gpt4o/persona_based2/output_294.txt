Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  28  99  61   7  95  66  38
1  55  90  63  41  93  90  19   5
2  87  19   6  67  91  34  94   9
3   2  83  37  53  61  80  72  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation according to their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items: 2 (99), 5 (95), 6 (66).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items: 1 (90), 4 (93), 5 (90).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items: 0 (87), 4 (91), 6 (94).
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items: 1 (83), 5 (80), 6 (72).

We will try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's high-value item acquisition while maintaining fairness.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (99) and item 5 (95), as these are the highest values for this agent.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (90) and item 4 (93), as these are the highest values for this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 0 (87) and item 6 (94), as these are the highest values for this agent.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 (53) and item 7 (31), as these are the highest values for this agent among the remaining items.

### Resulting Allocation
By following this allocation strategy, we ensure that each agent gets some of their highest-valued items, leading to a fair distribution where each agent receives two items.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total number of items allocated is 8, with each agent receiving two items, which is fair given the distribution of valuations.
