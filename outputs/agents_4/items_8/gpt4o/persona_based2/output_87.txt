Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  34  67   7  16  90  68  29
1  86  95  67  78  52  40   5  44
2  69  65  72  85  21  13  31  70
3  61  23  92  33  21  24  50  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels their allocation is fair given their own valuations. One approach to achieving an envy-free allocation is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item, starting with the agent who has the highest single-item valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest single-item valuation (95 for item 1). Agent 1 picks item 1.
2. **Agent 0** has the next highest single-item valuation (90 for item 5). Agent 0 picks item 5.
3. **Agent 3** has the next highest single-item valuation (92 for item 2). Agent 3 picks item 2.
4. **Agent 2** has the next highest single-item valuation (85 for item 3). Agent 2 picks item 3.

Now, we continue the round-robin picking from the beginning:

5. **Agent 1** picks the highest remaining valued item (86 for item 0). Agent 1 picks item 0.
6. **Agent 0** picks the highest remaining valued item (74 for item 0, but it's taken, so 68 for item 6). Agent 0 picks item 6.
7. **Agent 3** picks the highest remaining valued item (61 for item 0, but it's taken, so 59 for item 7). Agent 3 picks item 7.
8. **Agent 2** picks the last remaining item (70 for item 7, but it's taken, so 72 for item 4). Agent 2 picks item 4.

After completing the allocation, we ensure each agent has received items based on their preferences as best as possible. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and each agent has received items that they value relatively highly.
