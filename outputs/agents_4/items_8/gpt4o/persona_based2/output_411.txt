Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  94  89  43  55  72  55  15
1  14  13  77  29   2  19  62   9
2   0  18  49  48  23  89  70   8
3  25  21  39  88   4  76  88  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness, possibly targeting envy-freeness or minimizing envy as much as possible in this context. Envy-freeness means each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations, a common approach is to use algorithms like the adjusted winner procedure, or simple heuristics when computational methods are not applicable. Here, I'll provide a heuristic approach to allocate the items as fairly as possible.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Assign highest valued items to agents:** Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, if possible.

2. **Iterate through items:** For each item, allocate it to the agent who values it the most among those with fewer items, trying to balance the number of items.

3. **Check for envy:** After initial allocation, check if any agent envies another's allocation. If there's significant imbalance, reassign items to reduce this envy.

**Allocation Process:**

1. **Initial allocation based on highest values:**
   - Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 94).
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 77).
   - Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 89).
   - Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 88).

2. **Distribute remaining items:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 gets it (value 46).
   - Item 4: Agent 0 gets it (value 55).
   - Item 6: Agent 3 gets it (value 88).
   - Item 7: Agent 3 gets it (value 47).

This allocation considers both the values and attempts to distribute items such that agents receive items they value highly while ensuring a balanced allocation.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation assigns all items, with each agent receiving an integer number of items, and tries to balance the perceived value as much as possible given the constraints.
