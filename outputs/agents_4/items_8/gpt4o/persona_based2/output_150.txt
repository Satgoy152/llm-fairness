Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  44  17  21  64  28  95  92
1  33  18  34  67  76  26  43  61
2  98  54  20  63  21  16  43  74
3  15  39  84  91  13  65  82  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation given their valuation.

Let's proceed with one of the simplest fair division methods called the "round-robin" method, where each agent takes turns selecting the most valuable item available according to their personal valuation until all items are allocated. This method is straightforward and often used for practical fair division, especially when the number of items is equal to the number of agents.

Here is how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Their highest valued item is item 6 (95), followed by item 7 (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Their highest valued item is item 4 (76), followed by item 3 (67).
3. **Agent 2**: Their highest valued item is item 0 (98), followed by item 7 (74).
4. **Agent 3**: Their highest valued item is item 3 (91), followed by item 6 (82).

Now, we will apply the round-robin method:

1. **Round 1**:
   - **Agent 0** selects item 6 (95).
   - **Agent 1** selects item 4 (76).
   - **Agent 2** selects item 0 (98).
   - **Agent 3** selects item 3 (91).

2. **Round 2**:
   - **Agent 0** selects item 7 (92).
   - **Agent 1** selects item 5 (26).
   - **Agent 2** selects item 1 (54).
   - **Agent 3** selects item 2 (84).

After these selections, each agent has received two items, and all items are allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation should ensure that each agent receives items based on their preferences and minimize envy, given their valuations.
