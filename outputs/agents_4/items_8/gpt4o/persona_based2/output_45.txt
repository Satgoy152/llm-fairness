Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  41  67  84  30  27  63  10
1  80  93  91  61  43  33   2  23
2  16  55  58  18  83  33  81   3
3  64  79  17  39  69  98  67  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction while considering envy-freeness, if possible. Given that there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. However, the challenge lies in maximizing each agent's valuation of their allocated items while ensuring a fair distribution.

First, let's examine the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [18, 41, 67, 84, 30, 27, 63, 10]
- Agent 1: [80, 93, 91, 61, 43, 33, 2, 23]
- Agent 2: [16, 55, 58, 18, 83, 33, 81, 3]
- Agent 3: [64, 79, 17, 39, 69, 98, 67, 76]

Next, we allocate items by considering each agent's highest valuations and ensuring each agent receives 2 items. We'll try to minimize envy by considering each agent's top preferences:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 and item 2. Assign these items to Agent 1:
   - Allocation: {1: [1, 2]}

2. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most and next prefers item 3. Assign these items to Agent 3:
   - Allocation: {1: [1, 2], 3: [5, 3]}

3. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (but it is already taken) and next prefers item 6 and item 4. Assign these items to Agent 0:
   - Allocation: {0: [6, 4], 1: [1, 2], 3: [5, 3]}

4. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (but it is already taken) and next prefers item 6 and item 0. Assign these items to Agent 2:
   - Allocation: {0: [6, 4], 1: [1, 2], 2: [7, 0], 3: [5, 3]}

Finally, check to ensure all items are allocated and each agent has 2 items:

- Agent 0: [6, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [7, 0]
- Agent 3: [5, 3]

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they relatively value highly, while all agents receive an equal number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [7, 0],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```
