Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  82  14  64  36  79  29  15
1  80  81   0  65  22  68  11  87
2  70  95  89  70  21  20  13  97
3  24  73  71  60  36  55  85  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 82 14 64 36 79 29 15]
 [80 81  0 65 22 68 11 87]
 [70 95 89 70 21 20 13 97]
 [24 73 71 60 36 55 85 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy by considering each agent's valuations. One way to achieve this is by maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most.

By assigning the highest valued items to each agent, we can ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. However, we need to consider the overall allocation to ensure no agent envies another.

Let's proceed with allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items 1 (82) and 5 (79). Total valuation: 161.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 0 (80) and 3 (65). Total valuation: 145.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 2 (89) and 7 (97). Total valuation: 186.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items 4 (36) and 6 (85). Total valuation: 121.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, minimizing envy among them.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
