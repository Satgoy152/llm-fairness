Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  28  91   2   7  83   2  28
1  21   0  61  51   6  49  24   4
2   7  30  51   4  15  52   8  32
3  79  23  24  95  55  80  53  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To create a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for a distribution that minimizes envy and ensures each agent values their bundle as highly as possible. Given the valuations, we can use a method such as the "maximin" approach, where we try to maximize the minimum value that each agent receives.

Let's break down the valuations for a better perspective:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 2 and item 5.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly, as well as item 3.
- Agent 2 values item 5 and item 7 relatively highly.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for item 3 and item 0.

We'll aim to distribute items with these preferences in mind, trying to balance the allocation so that the least satisfied agent is as well-off as possible.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item, if possible.
2. Balance the remaining items to ensure each agent receives a reasonable total valuation.

Following this strategy, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 1
- Agent 1 gets items: 3, 4
- Agent 2 gets items: 5, 7
- Agent 3 gets items: 0, 6

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent gets a bundle with at least one item they highly value, while also distributing the remaining items to balance the overall satisfaction.

Let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
