Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  12  93  46  78  44  52  90
1  21   7  20  69   4  33  59  67
2  19   8  53   0  94  40  82  43
3  57  64  92  89  67  35  35  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the four agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, based on their personal valuations.

Given that there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items to ensure an equal distribution. However, the key is to ensure that the distribution is also envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible based on the given valuations.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring the total number of items allocated remains 8.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation items are 2 (93) and 7 (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation items are 3 (69) and 7 (67).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation items are 4 (94) and 6 (82).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation items are 2 (92) and 3 (89).

### Proposed Allocation:
- Agent 0: Receive items 2 and 7 (93, 90) - Total value = 183
- Agent 1: Receive items 5 and 6 (33, 59) - Total value = 92
- Agent 2: Receive items 1 and 4 (8, 94) - Total value = 102
- Agent 3: Receive items 0 and 3 (57, 89) - Total value = 146

This allocation is constructed to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest available valuations without overlap, ensuring each agent receives 2 items and no items are left unallocated.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that are highly valued according to their individual valuation matrix, striving to achieve a fair and envy-free distribution.
