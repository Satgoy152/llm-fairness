Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  75  35  67  79  79  42  77
1  95  70  20  21  75  66  82  71
2  47  63  94  38   6   0  24  60
3  11  78  27  18  61  35  64  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve a fair division that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items. We will use a heuristic approach that considers the valuations and tries to distribute the items to balance the perceived value across agents.

Let's analyze the provided valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  75  35  67  79  79  42  77
1  95  70  20  21  75  66  82  71
2  47  63  94  38   6   0  24  60
3  11  78  27  18  61  35  64  37
```

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Assign high-value items to agents preferring them**: Start by assigning items that are highly valued by particular agents, ensuring they gain significant satisfaction.

2. **Balance the total value**: Try to distribute the items such that the total valuation perceived by each agent is roughly balanced.

3. **Iterate and adjust**: Iterate over the allocation to ensure that no agent envies another significantly, adjusting items to balance perceived values.

Let's execute this approach:

1. **Assign high-value items**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 98, highest for this item).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 94, highest for this item).

2. **Balance values**:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 78, highest among remaining).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 21, as we aim to balance based on remaining values).

3. **Continue balancing**:
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 79).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 66).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value 64).
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (value 60).

Now, let's check the allocation to ensure each agent has a fair share in terms of perceived value:

- Agent 0: [0, 4] = 98 + 79 = 177
- Agent 1: [3, 5] = 21 + 66 = 87
- Agent 2: [2, 7] = 94 + 60 = 154
- Agent 3: [1, 6] = 78 + 64 = 142

The allocation is fairly balanced given the constraints and ensures the items are distributed to minimize envy.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
