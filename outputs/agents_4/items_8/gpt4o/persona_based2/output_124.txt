Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  95  16   3  99  65  18  64
1  82  93   1  41  81  22  13  33
2  56  84  94  79  44   1  91  40
3  50  84  30  45  46  83  83  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer to have another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations in the table, we'll use a strategy to maximize fairness.

Firstly, we need to observe the valuations to determine potential high-value items for each agent. One approach is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that no agent ends up envying another.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** values items 0 and 1 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 2 and 3 highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 highly, and also values items 1 and 5.

To allocate fairly and minimize envy:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (valued at 99).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 93).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (valued at 94).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (valued at 94).

Now, distribute the remaining items by considering second-highest preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (valued at 82).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (valued at 83).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (valued at 79).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (valued at 18).

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items, and items are distributed based on maximizing each agent's perceived value and fairness:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [7, 5]
}
```

This allocation considers the agents' preferences and attempts to provide a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
