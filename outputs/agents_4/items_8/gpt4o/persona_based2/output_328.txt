Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40   9  13  41   0   3  66  30
1  54  53  96  19  37   3   9  58
2  10   6   1  25  28  23   8  73
3  18  91  42  24   5   3  24  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that respects envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness is a state where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own, given their individual valuations.

A simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm where items are allocated to the agents who value them the most. We will iterate over each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 54.
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 91.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 41.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 28.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 23.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 66.
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 73.

After this allocation, each agent has at least one item. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 5, 7],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that items are distributed based on the highest individual valuations, aiming for minimal envy among agents.
