Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  30  76  23  35   2  49  21
1  12  83  93  81  80  58  65  75
2  68  86   3  57   4  76  87  64
3  76  53  71  85   2  26  48  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. One approach is to use the "round-robin" method, which is a common strategy in fair division problems. This method involves sequentially allocating items to agents in a way that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation using the round-robin method:

1. **Agent 0**: Choose item 0 (value 94, highest for agent 0).
2. **Agent 1**: Choose item 2 (value 93, highest for agent 1).
3. **Agent 2**: Choose item 6 (value 87, highest for agent 2).
4. **Agent 3**: Choose item 7 (value 89, highest for agent 3).

Now each agent has received one item. Continue with the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0**: Choose item 1 (value 30, next highest for agent 0).
6. **Agent 1**: Choose item 3 (value 81, next highest for agent 1).
7. **Agent 2**: Choose item 5 (value 76, next highest for agent 2).
8. **Agent 3**: Choose item 4 (value 2, only item left for agent 3).

All items are now allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation uses a simple round-robin approach to ensure each agent receives items in a way that considers their highest valuations first, attempting to achieve a fair distribution.
