Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37   7  52  26  23  18  25  38
1  74  57  65  17  22  64  91  24
2  30   3  90  53  57  22  17   0
3  80  83  57  52  87  90  10   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent receives a set of items such that no agent would prefer to have another agent's allocation instead of their own, given their valuations.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Value highest for item 2.
   - Next highest values for items: 7, 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Value highest for item 6.
   - Next highest values for items: 0, 2.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Value highest for item 2.
   - Next highest values for items: 3, 4.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Value highest for item 5.
   - Next highest values for items: 1, 4.

We'll aim for a balanced allocation where each agent's total value is maximized. Let's try to allocate items such that the allocation is envy-free.

### Allocation Steps:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [2, 7] - total value = 52 + 38 = 90
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [6, 1] - total value = 91 + 57 = 148
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items [3, 0] - total value = 53 + 30 = 83
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items [5, 4] - total value = 90 + 87 = 177

This allocation is based on maximizing each agent's value given their preferences, while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their individual valuation within the constraints.
