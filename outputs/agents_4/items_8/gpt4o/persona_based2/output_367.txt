Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  72  77   6  72  27  93  77
1   0  67  71  43  92  29  99  32
2  86  47  11  89  21   6   5   6
3  16  78  72  36  36  98  15  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a manner that is as fair as possible, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility while attempting to ensure envy-freeness. One method to achieve this is to iteratively assign items to agents based on the highest marginal increase in utility, ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 86. Assign item 0 to agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 72. Assign item 1 to agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 77. Assign item 2 to agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 89. Assign item 3 to agent 2.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 92. Assign item 4 to agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 98. Assign item 5 to agent 3.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 99. Assign item 6 to agent 1.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 77. Assign item 7 to agent 0.

This allocation is based on giving each item to the agent who values it the most, which should help in aiming towards fairness and reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5]
}
```
