Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  91  20  60  25   2  95  96
1  92  88  57  40  99  66  85  89
2  53  15  46  23   8  52  92  78
3  96  44  21   6  89  79  43   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for a distribution that is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (96). 
   - Next, they value item 6 highly (95).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (99).
   - Next, they value item 0 highly (92).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (92), but since it's already allocated, we move to the next highest.
   - They value item 7 next highest (78), but it's allocated, so we move to the next highest.
   - They value item 5 significantly (52).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (96), but it's allocated, so we move to the next highest.
   - They value item 4 next highest (89), but it's allocated, so we move to the next highest.
   - They value item 5 significantly (79), but it's allocated, so we move to the next highest.
   - They value item 1 next highest (44).

Let's finalize the allocations:

- **Agent 0** gets items: 7, 6
- **Agent 1** gets items: 4, 0
- **Agent 2** gets items: 5, 2
- **Agent 3** gets items: 1, 3

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible based on the given valuations. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This solution attempts to balance allocations by considering each agent's most valued items within the constraints.
