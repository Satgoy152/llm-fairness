Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  98  21  54   5  24  20  62
1  43  26  66  46  34  42  33  98
2  81  98  63  21  59  44  47  17
3  91  72  36  39   3  68  41  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the others. Given the valuations, we can use the Maximum Weighted Matching approach or other fair division strategies to ensure a balanced allocation.

First, let's analyze the total value each agent attributes to all the items:

- Agent 0: 11 + 98 + 21 + 54 + 5 + 24 + 20 + 62 = 295
- Agent 1: 43 + 26 + 66 + 46 + 34 + 42 + 33 + 98 = 388
- Agent 2: 81 + 98 + 63 + 21 + 59 + 44 + 47 + 17 = 430
- Agent 3: 91 + 72 + 36 + 39 + 3 + 68 + 41 + 30 = 380

Now we try to allocate items such that the total perceived value by each agent is roughly balanced.

We will consider the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to allocate them in a way that minimizes envy.

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (98) and item 7 (62). We will assign these high-value items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 7 (98), but since it is already taken, we assign item 2 (66) and item 5 (42) which are also high for them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 (81) and item 1 (98), but since item 1 is taken, we assign item 0 (81) and item 4 (59).
4. **Agent 3** can be allocated the remaining items, which are item 3 (39) and item 6 (41).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they highly value where possible, and each receives an equal number of items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation is designed to reduce envy by ensuring each agent gets at least some of the items they value most.
