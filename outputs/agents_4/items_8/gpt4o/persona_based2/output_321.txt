Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86   4  53   8  26  34   9  83
1  43  70   0  22  65  16  63  35
2  55  37  80  76  71  95  52  80
3  62  46  49  35  13   4  25  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [62 46 49 35 13  4 25 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, meaning that each agent should feel that they received a fair share according to their own valuation. We can attempt to do this using the concept of maximizing each agent's total value received, while keeping their allocations as envy-free as possible under these constraints.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 0 and 7 with high valuations. 

2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 1 and 4 with high valuations.

3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 5, 2, and 7 with high valuations.

4. **Agent 3**: Has relatively lower valuations but prefers item 0.

Let's proceed with a possible allocation strategy:

- **Assign item 0 to Agent 0**: This is their most valued item.
- **Assign item 1 to Agent 1**: This is their most valued item.
- **Assign item 2 to Agent 2**: This is one of their highly valued items.
- **Assign item 3 to Agent 2**: This has a relatively high value for Agent 2.
- **Assign item 4 to Agent 1**: Maintaining the high valuation for Agent 1.
- **Assign item 5 to Agent 2**: Maximizes Agent 2's valuation.
- **Assign item 6 to Agent 3**: To balance allocations, this item goes to Agent 3.
- **Assign item 7 to Agent 0**: Completes Agent 0â€™s allocation with another high-value item.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their preferences and attempts to minimize envy within the confines of integer allocations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5],
    "3": [6]
}
```
