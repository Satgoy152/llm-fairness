Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  41  54  46  78  78  84  39
1  51  71   3  41  13  44  45  94
2  38  74  33  36  38  99  51  95
3  41   1  11  55  42  54  39   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we'll consider their valuations for each item. A common approach is to maximize the minimum utility each agent receives, attempting to balance the allocations so that no agent envies another's allocation. 

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 6 and 4. Allocating these two items gives them a high utility. 

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 7. Allocating this item provides them significant utility. We also allocate item 1 to this agent, which they value reasonably well.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 5. Allocating this item provides them significant utility. We also allocate item 2 to this agent, which they value reasonably.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 the most among their options. Allocating this item provides them some utility. We also allocate item 0 to this agent.

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with items they value highly, minimizing potential envy. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items they have relatively high valuations for, which helps achieve a fair and envy-free distribution.
