Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  95  93  92  92  47  61  16
1  36  42  39  35  34  32  44  61
2  75   9  46  48  81   2  48  66
3   1  96   8  36  69  19  67  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the fair division problem with the provided valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible and preferably envy-free, meaning each agent should feel that their share is at least as good as any other agent's share according to their own valuation.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   97  95  93  92  92  47  61  16
1   36  42  39  35  34  32  44  61
2   75   9  46  48  81   2  48  66
3    1  96   8  36  69  19  67  37
```

Let's try to allocate the items to the agents such that the total perceived value for each agent is maximized according to their preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 0, 1, 2, and 3 (highest values).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 7 (highest value).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 4 (highest value).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 1 (highest value).

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 2. These are the highest preferences for Agent 0, and it gets them a substantial amount of value.

- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 7. This is the highest value item for Agent 1.

- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4. This is the highest value item for Agent 2.

- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 1, 3, 5, and 6. This gives Agent 3 the highest remaining valued items according to their preferences.

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated and that the allocation is as balanced as possible. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.
