Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  85  47  13  60  86  48  44
1  44  72  86  87  97  23  30  33
2  39  16   9  20  60  38   5  39
3  71  43   3  85  49  49  23  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider their valuations. Our goal is to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, meaning that no agent would prefer the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

First, let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [76, 85, 47, 13, 60, 86, 48, 44]
- Agent 1: [44, 72, 86, 87, 97, 23, 30, 33]
- Agent 2: [39, 16, 9, 20, 60, 38, 5, 39]
- Agent 3: [71, 43, 3, 85, 49, 49, 23, 66]

To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we can use an iterative approach, assigning each agent items where they have relatively higher valuations compared to others, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest (76).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest (85).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest (86).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the highest (85).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the highest (97).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the highest (86).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the highest (48).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the highest (66).

After this initial allocation, let's evaluate and adjust to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0 has items [0, 1, 5, 6]
- Agent 1 has items [2, 4]
- Agent 2 has no items
- Agent 3 has items [3, 7]

Since Agent 2 received no items, let's adjust:

- Reallocate item 6 to Agent 2 as they value it second least, but it's the least among remaining items they could get without causing envy elsewhere.

Checking against the valuations again, we adjust to maximize each agent's satisfaction while maintaining fairness:

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 5]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [6] 
- Agent 3: [3, 7]

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

Each agent receives items based on their highest valuations where possible, and the adjustment ensures that all items are fairly distributed.
