Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  89   5  54  53  99  41  15
1  98  27  13  26  26  66  64  59
2  10  19  39  44  24   1  82  34
3  84  80  76  10  61  40  28   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [84 80 76 10 61 40 28  7]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will aim to create an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own given their valuations. Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should receive 2 items to ensure an equal distribution.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (99), Item 1 (89)
   - Allocate Items 5 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest remaining valuations: Item 0 (98), Item 6 (64)
   - Allocate Items 0 and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest remaining valuations: Item 2 (39), Item 7 (34)
   - Allocate Items 2 and 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Remaining items: Item 3, Item 4
   - Allocate Items 3 and 4 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items and should minimize envy given their different valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
