Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  81   8  73  26  47  25  47
1  63  12  29  16  30  86  59  31
2  52  32  43  27  70   5  11  23
3   2  24  94  95  84  86  88  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing each agent's minimum value of allocated items. Given that there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

We'll start by examining each agent's preferences and allocating items to maximize individual satisfaction while maintaining fairness.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (81) followed by item 3 (73).
   - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - With item 1 already allocated, Agent 1 highly values item 5 (86) and item 0 (63).
   - Allocate items 5 and 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (70) followed by item 2 (43).
   - Allocate items 4 and 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Remaining items are 6 and 7. Agent 3 values item 6 (88) and item 7 (57).
   - Allocate items 6 and 7 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocation:
This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items and attempts to maximize their valuations based on available items at each step.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```
