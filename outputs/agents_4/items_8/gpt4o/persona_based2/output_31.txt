Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  15  42  10  87  79  37  90
1  93  84   7  39  37  85  89  24
2  22  51   6  95  41  84  61  46
3   4  52  75  78  97  51   9  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to allocate them so that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

One possible approach is to use the method of "round-robin" allocation, where each agent, in turn, picks their most preferred item from the remaining items until all items are allocated. This approach approximates envy-freeness by ensuring that each agent gets a chance to pick the most valuable remaining item according to their valuation.

Here's how this might work with the given data:

1. **Agent 0**: Picks item 7 (value 90)
2. **Agent 1**: Picks item 0 (value 93)
3. **Agent 2**: Picks item 3 (value 95)
4. **Agent 3**: Picks item 4 (value 97)
5. **Agent 0**: Picks item 4 (since item 7 is already taken, next is item 5 with value 79)
6. **Agent 1**: Picks item 5 (value 85)
7. **Agent 2**: Picks item 1 (value 51)
8. **Agent 3**: Picks item 2 (value 75)

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated in a way that respects the constraints:

- Agent 0 has items [7, 6]
- Agent 1 has items [0, 5]
- Agent 2 has items [3, 1]
- Agent 3 has items [4, 2]

Rechecking the allocations, we find:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 1]
- Agent 3: [4, 2, 6]

To ensure all 8 items are allocated, we need to adjust the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Picks item 6 (value 37)
2. **Agent 3**: Takes item 2 (value 75)

Now, we have:

- Agent 0: [7, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 1]
- Agent 3: [4, 2]

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```

Each agent has an allocation, and all 8 items are accounted for, respecting the constraints given.
