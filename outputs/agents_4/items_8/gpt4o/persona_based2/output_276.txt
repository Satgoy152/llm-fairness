Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  57  62  46  62  99  86  93
1   2  43  38   7  94   1  38  73
2  68  46  48  21  48  80  40  82
3  46   3  42   0  20  95  63  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible given their valuations. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is the product of the utilities each agent derives from their allocation. We will ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 5, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 5 and 7, but we might need to compromise due to agent 0's higher valuations.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly.

A possible fair allocation considering the valuations is as follows:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value: 84).
2. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value: 95).
3. Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value: 93).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value: 94).
5. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value: 86).
6. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value: 46).
7. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value: 48).
8. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value: 7).

This allocation tries to balance the high-value items among different agents while considering the overall distribution. The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent receives a non-negative number of items.
