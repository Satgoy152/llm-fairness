Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  56  88  17  78  25   5  73
1  12  45   9  31  28  64  19  97
2  38  43  30  26  19  47  67  91
3  29  41  21  23  15  32  89  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's approach this by first calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items, and then try to balance the allocations so that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuation.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 75 + 56 + 88 + 17 + 78 + 25 + 5 + 73 = 417
- Agent 1: 12 + 45 + 9 + 31 + 28 + 64 + 19 + 97 = 305
- Agent 2: 38 + 43 + 30 + 26 + 19 + 47 + 67 + 91 = 361
- Agent 3: 29 + 41 + 21 + 23 + 15 + 32 + 89 + 81 = 331

The total value across all agents and items is 1414. Ideally, each agent should receive approximately an equal share of the total value, which is around 353.5. However, since the items must be allocated entirely to one agent or another, we aim for a balanced distribution according to their preferences.

Allocating the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, and 4, so we will allocate those to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 7. We'll allocate that to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 7 as well, but item 6 is the next highest, so we allocate that to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values items 6 and 7, but since item 6 is taken, we allocate item 5 instead.

Let's refine this allocation to ensure each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 4] with valuations 75, 88, 78 = 241
- Agent 1: [7] with valuation 97
- Agent 2: [1, 3] with valuations 43, 26 = 69
- Agent 3: [5, 6] with valuations 32, 89 = 121

Re-evaluating for fairness, we should adjust to distribute items more evenly by value:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, who values it more than Agent 2 (45 vs. 43)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, where it's valued at 23, slightly more than Agent 2's 26

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 2] with valuations 75, 88 = 163
- Agent 1: [1, 7] with valuations 45, 97 = 142
- Agent 2: [4, 6] with valuations 19, 67 = 86
- Agent 3: [3, 5] with valuations 23, 32 = 55

Now, let's adjust further to ensure no agent envies another's allocation:

Final allocation refinement:

1. Agent 0: [0, 2] (valuations 75, 88)
2. Agent 1: [7] (valuation 97) - Add item 3 (valuation 31) for balance
3. Agent 2: [6] (valuation 67) - Add item 1 (valuation 43) for balance
4. Agent 3: [4, 5] (valuations 15, 32)

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the value each agent receives while trying to minimize envy. Note that due to discrete item allocations and differing valuations, perfect envy-freeness might not be fully achievable, but this is a reasonable distribution balancing these constraints.
