Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  40  18  38  92  63   3  89
1  73  84  89  39  26  88  55  60
2  49  56  74  65  73  42  48   0
3  61  43  82  15  10   6  22  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an adjusted version of the envy-free fair division method. Given that we have 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items to ensure a fair distribution in terms of quantity. We'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 (92) and 7 (89).
   - Assign items 4 and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (89) and 5 (88).
   - Assign items 2 and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (74) and 4 (73), but these are already allocated.
   - Next highest are items 3 (65) and 5 (42), but item 5 is allocated.
   - Assign items 3 and 0 to Agent 2, with values 65 and 49, respectively.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 7 (95) and 2 (82), but these are already allocated.
   - Next highest are items 0 (61) and 1 (43).
   - Assign items 1 and 6 to Agent 3.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 3, 0
- Agent 3: Items 1, 6

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives 2 items, maximizing their individual valuations.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
