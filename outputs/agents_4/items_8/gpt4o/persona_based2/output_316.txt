Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  32  74  89  90  74  90  73
1  54  14  45  51  50  36  96  22
2  59  87  77  31  21  31  55   6
3  20  34  61  86  56  10  91  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. Given that there are 8 items and 4 agents, a natural starting point would be to aim for each agent to receive approximately 2 items. However, to ensure envy-freeness, we will need to consider the specific valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values items 4 and 6 the most (both at 90).
- **Agent 1** values item 6 the most (96).
- **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (87).
- **Agent 3** values items 3 and 6 the most (86 and 91, respectively).

To attempt an envy-free allocation, start by assigning each agent one of their most valued items if possible, then distribute the remaining items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Assign highest valued items:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (90)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (96)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (87)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 (86)

2. **Allocate remaining items by considering second-highest preferences and ensuring total allocation of 8 items:**
   - Agent 0 also values item 5 (74).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 (54).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 (77).
   - Agent 3 values item 7 (86).

These assignments respect the most significant asset each agent values while keeping an eye on their secondary preferences.

Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, with a balanced distribution that attempts to minimize envy among the agents.
