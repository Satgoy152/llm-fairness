Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  59  90  11  29  49   0  93
1  86  76  86  14  25  40  41  23
2  14  84  80  85  42   3  11  54
3  81  11  41  64   1  83  77  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. One approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where each agent takes turns picking the item they value most that is still available. This method doesn't guarantee envy-freeness but provides a reasonable approximation.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 values item 7 the most at 93. They pick item 7.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 86. They pick item 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 85. They pick item 3.
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the most at 83. They pick item 5.

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 now values item 2 the most at 90. They pick item 2.
   - Agent 1 now values item 2 the most at 86, but it is taken. Their next highest is item 1 at 76. They pick item 1.
   - Agent 2 now values item 1 the most at 84, but it is taken. Their next highest is item 2 at 80, but it is taken. Their next highest is item 7 at 54, but it is taken. Their next highest is item 4 at 42. They pick item 4.
   - Agent 3 picks the remaining item 6 with a valuation of 77.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Items 5, 6

Let's put this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents.
