Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  59   6  79  79  56  39  52
1  37  84   4   8  39  32   9   1
2  62  28  86  42  82  44  73  65
3  82  18  13  72  76  65  73  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation of the items to the agents, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) criterion, which tries to maximize the product of the utilities of the agents. Here's a step-by-step approach to find an allocation that is as fair as possible:

1. **Identify the total value of items for each agent:**  
   - Agent 0: 464
   - Agent 1: 214
   - Agent 2: 482
   - Agent 3: 489

2. **Assign items greedily while prioritizing balance and fairness:**  
   - Start by giving each agent their most valued items, while making sure the allocation remains balanced.

3. **Allocate items:**
   - **Agent 0**: 
     - Item 0 (value 92)
     - Item 3 (value 79)
   - **Agent 1**: 
     - Item 1 (value 84)
     - Item 4 (value 39)
     - Item 5 (value 32)
   - **Agent 2**: 
     - Item 2 (value 86)
     - Item 6 (value 73)
   - **Agent 3**: 
     - Item 7 (value 90)

This allocation should maximize fairness by considering each agent's top valuations while ensuring an integer number of items per agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [7]
}
```
