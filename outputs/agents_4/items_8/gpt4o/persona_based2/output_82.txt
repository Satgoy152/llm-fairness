Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  25   7   6  39   5  19  73
1  98  38  38  93  66  21  16  11
2  78  31   5  99   9  26   7  94
3  88  33  66  56   8  89  84  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a bundle of items such that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation, based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations, we can use the following approach to allocate items:

1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Total value per agent:
     - Agent 0: \(5 + 25 + 7 + 6 + 39 + 5 + 19 + 73 = 179\)
     - Agent 1: \(98 + 38 + 38 + 93 + 66 + 21 + 16 + 11 = 381\)
     - Agent 2: \(78 + 31 + 5 + 99 + 9 + 26 + 7 + 94 = 349\)
     - Agent 3: \(88 + 33 + 66 + 56 + 8 + 89 + 84 + 57 = 481\)

2. **Item Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate items to maximize the perceived value for each agent while trying to balance the allocations.
   - Attempt to give each agent at least two items to maintain balance.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Agent 1 highly values items 0 and 3, so we allocate those to Agent 1.
   - Agent 3 has the highest total value and values items 5 and 6 highly, so allocate those to Agent 3.
   - Agent 2 values item 7 highly, so allocate that to Agent 2.
   - Assign remaining items 1, 2, and 4 to agents based on their preferences while avoiding envy.

4. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4.
   - Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 2 gets items 7 and 2.
   - Agent 3 gets items 5 and 6.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent and minimize envy.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
