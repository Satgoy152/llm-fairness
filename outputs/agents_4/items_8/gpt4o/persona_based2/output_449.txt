Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  38   2  69  11  82   8  38
1  30  97  93  64  79  58   9  57
2  55  86   1  20  34  31  26  24
3  87  70  94  57  99   1  77   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we aim to satisfy the condition of envy-freeness as much as possible, given the integer constraint. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This often involves maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while considering the others' valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 37 + 38 + 2 + 69 + 11 + 82 + 8 + 38 = 285
- Agent 1: 30 + 97 + 93 + 64 + 79 + 58 + 9 + 57 = 487
- Agent 2: 55 + 86 + 1 + 20 + 34 + 31 + 26 + 24 = 277
- Agent 3: 87 + 70 + 94 + 57 + 99 + 1 + 77 + 8 = 493

Given these total valuations, we aim to allocate items to maximize individual agent satisfaction while considering others' interests. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest total valuation, indicating a strong interest in many items. We prioritize high-value items for Agent 3.
2. **Agent 1** has the second-highest total valuation, so we allocate high-value items that Agent 3 doesn't prefer as much.
3. **Agent 0** and **Agent 2** have lower total valuations, so they can be allocated items that are less preferred by Agents 1 and 3.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 3** values item 4 (99) the highest, so we allocate it to them. They also value item 2 (94) highly.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 (97) the highest, and item 2 (93) is also of high value. We allocate item 1 to Agent 1 since item 2 is allocated to Agent 3.
- **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 5 (82), so we allocate it to them.
- **Agent 2** has item 0 (55) as their highest, so we allocate it to them.

Continuing this approach, here's the complete allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [5, 6] (Values: 82, 8)
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 3] (Values: 97, 64)
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 7] (Values: 55, 24)
- **Agent 3**: Items [2, 4] (Values: 94, 99)

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while considering their highest-valued items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated while aiming for a fair division based on the agents' valuations.
