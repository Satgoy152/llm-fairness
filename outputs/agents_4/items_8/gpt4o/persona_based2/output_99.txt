Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  90  80  88  47  32  53  90
1  85  32  31   4  75  86  36  39
2  95  83  78  17  45  35  87  86
3  24  83  29  15  24  30  81  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can utilize the method of "round-robin allocation" or "sequential allocation." In this method, each agent takes turns picking their most preferred remaining item until all items are allocated. This method attempts to minimize envy, as each agent selects the item they value most highly from the available options.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 90).
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 86).
   - Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 95).
   - Agent 3 picks item 6 (value 81).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 90).
   - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 75).
   - Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 78).
   - Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 15).

After these selections, all items have been allocated. The resulting allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the allocation is made fairly based on the descending order of their preferences. This approach attempts to reduce envy by allowing each agent to pick their most valued items in a sequential manner.
