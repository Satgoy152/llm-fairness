Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65   7  93  25  31  19  80  57
1  51  84  79  77   5  11  79  60
2  13  67  12  65  25  50  10  95
3   2   4  86  14  28  12  83  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an algorithmic approach like the "round robin" or "maximum envy-free" allocation. Considering the given valuations, our aim is to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their individual valuations. Here's one way to achieve this:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value for item 2 (93).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for item 1 (84).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value for item 7 (95).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value for item 6 (83).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 0:**
   - Remaining highest value for item 0 (65).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1:**
   - Remaining highest value for item 3 (77).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2:**
   - Remaining highest value for item 5 (50).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3:**
   - Remaining highest value for item 4 (28).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocations:

The allocation results in each agent getting two items, and the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [6, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations, ensuring no agent envies another's allocation.
