Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  92  76   7  94  85  75  12
1  60  16  96  48  54   4  32  31
2  46  96  47   3  44  31  90  64
3  19  58  15  50  55  16  28  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free division. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items held by another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

One approach to find a fair allocation is to use a variant of the adjusted winner procedure, or to use a round-robin selection based on the highest valuations for each agent. Given the complexity of ensuring envy-freeness and integer allocations, this solution will aim to distribute the items to maximize each agent's utility, ensuring that no one feels deprived based on the provided valuations.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Sort each agent's item valuations from highest to lowest.
2. Allocate items to each agent starting with their highest-valued available item until all items are allocated.

Following these steps, we attempt to distribute the items:

- Agent 0 values items: 4 (94), 1 (92), 5 (85), 2 (76), 6 (75), 0 (50), 7 (12), 3 (7)
- Agent 1 values items: 2 (96), 0 (60), 4 (54), 3 (48), 7 (31), 6 (32), 1 (16), 5 (4)
- Agent 2 values items: 1 (96), 6 (90), 7 (64), 2 (47), 0 (46), 4 (44), 5 (31), 3 (3)
- Agent 3 values items: 4 (55), 3 (50), 1 (58), 7 (47), 0 (19), 5 (16), 6 (28), 2 (15)

Allocation:
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (second highest value for Agent 3)

After these allocations, every item has been assigned, and we aim for an envy-free distribution.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation seeks to maximize the valuations for each agent, fulfilling their highest preferences where possible.
