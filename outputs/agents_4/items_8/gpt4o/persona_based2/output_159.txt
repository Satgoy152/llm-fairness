Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  91  93  10  74  23  94  95
1  79  96  19  32  22  65  86  17
2  92  42  22  58   8  94  85   4
3  15  27  54  54   1  92  85  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This typically means that each agent should feel that they received a fair share based upon their valuations, and no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent given their own valuations.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:**
   - Each agent values the items differently, so identify which items are most valued by each agent.

2. **Implement a Round-Robin Allocation:**
   - Allocate items in a manner that each agent sequentially gets to pick their most valued remaining item.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Review the allocations to ensure that no agent envies another based on their own valuations.

4. **Finalize Allocations:**
   - Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent's allocation is as fair as possible.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are items 2, 7, and 6.
- **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are items 1, 0, and 6.
- **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are items 0, 5, and 6.
- **Agent 3:** Highest valuations are items 5, 6, and 7.

Given these preferences, we allocate as follows:

1. **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** gets items 1 and 4.
3. **Agent 2** gets items 5 and 6.
4. **Agent 3** gets items 3 and 7.

The allocations are finalized as such:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of the most valued items among the agents, aiming to minimize envy given the provided valuations.
