Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  74  35   1  99  50  12  81
1  89  90  14  52  18  58  80   6
2  60  36  16  85  75  93  17  86
3  43  98  24   6  55  70  64  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to maintain envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of the items by each agent. In this scenario, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation relative to their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to find an allocation:

1. **List the total valuation each agent has for all items**: 
   - Agent 0: 92 + 74 + 35 + 1 + 99 + 50 + 12 + 81 = 444
   - Agent 1: 89 + 90 + 14 + 52 + 18 + 58 + 80 + 6 = 407
   - Agent 2: 60 + 36 + 16 + 85 + 75 + 93 + 17 + 86 = 468
   - Agent 3: 43 + 98 + 24 + 6 + 55 + 70 + 64 + 99 = 459

2. **Allocate highest-valued items to each agent based on their preferences**:
   - **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest (99), followed by item 0 (92).
   - **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the highest (90), followed by item 0 (89).
   - **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the highest (93), followed by item 7 (86).
   - **Agent 3**: Values item 7 the highest (99), followed by item 1 (98).

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

4. **Distribute remaining items considering the next highest preferences**:
   - Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 6
   - Agent 0: Remaining items preference: 0 (92)
   - Agent 1: Remaining items preference: 0 (89)
   - Agent 2: Remaining items preference: 6 (17)
   - Agent 3: Remaining items preference: 6 (64)

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1, since Agent 0 has already received a high-value item.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they have no allocation yet.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they have a lower sum allocated than others.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

Final allocations ensure each agent has received items and attempts to balance total valuations. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
This allocation attempts to respect the preferences of each agent while ensuring every agent gets at least one item. Adjustments can be made to further balance envy if necessary, within the constraints of integer allocations.
