Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  16  48  76  35  49  41  47
1   3  77  14  99  67  23  18  16
2  99  75  11   5  56  66  70  19
3  28  88  99  98  68  99  40  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to minimize envy, such as the Envy-Free up to One Good (EF1) criterion, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, I'll propose an allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items that Agent 0 values highly. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (76), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items that Agent 1 values highly. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, but since it's already allocated, we move to item 1 (77) and assign it to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items that Agent 2 values highly. Agent 2 values item 0 (99) the highest, so assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Prioritize items that Agent 3 values highly. Agent 3 values item 2 (99) the highest, so assign item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining items**: Allocate remaining items by considering the next highest values for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

   - Agent 0: After item 3, Agent 0 values item 0 (49) next, but it's allocated. Next is item 5 (49), so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (67) is the next highest unallocated item for Agent 1, so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2: After item 0, Agent 2 values item 6 (70), so assign item 6 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3: After item 2, Agent 3 values item 5 (99) next, but it's allocated. Next is item 7 (95), so assign item 7 to Agent 3.

Let's ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [3, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [0, 6]
- Agent 3: [2, 7]

This allocation should be reasonably fair given the constraints.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```
