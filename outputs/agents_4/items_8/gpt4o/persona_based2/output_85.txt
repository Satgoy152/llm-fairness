Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  68  22  89   8  77  99  99
1  42   0   0  58  18   0  86  72
2  16  66  42  55  46  32  53  12
3   4  12  22   9  32   2  16  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. In this context, we are looking for a distribution of items that respects the agents' valuations and gives each agent a fair share.

Let's analyze the valuations to determine a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, 6, and 7. 
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 6 and also values items 3 and 7.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively balanced valuation and might benefit from items like 1, 2, and 4.
4. **Agent 3** has the least overall valuation but values item 7 the most.

A possible fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1 - These items collect significant value for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 6 - These are high-valued items for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 4, 5 - These items are of moderate value to Agent 2, allowing a balanced distribution.
- **Agent 3**: Item 7 - This item provides the most value to Agent 3.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 5],
    "3": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences and tries to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly.
