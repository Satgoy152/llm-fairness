Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21   3  54  46  73   6  79  96
1  79  92  75  97  43   2  82  31
2  96  97  91  38   8  74  51  89
3  49  73  73  64  49  85   1  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21  3 54 46 73  6 79 96]
 [79 92 75 97 43  2 82 31]
 [96 97 91 38  8 74 51 89]
 [49 73 73 64 49 85  1 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division as much as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We will use the valuations provided to guide the allocation process.

### Valuation Table Recap:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21   3  54  46  73   6  79  96
1  79  92  75  97  43   2  82  31
2  96  97  91  38   8  74  51  89
3  49  73  73  64  49  85   1  23
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify Preferences:** Look at the highest valuations for each agent to identify their preferences.
2. **Fair Allocation:** Distribute items to balance preferences and attempt to minimize envy.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
- **Agent 0:**
  - High valuation items: 7 (96), 6 (79), 4 (73)
  - Allocate items: [6, 7]

- **Agent 1:**
  - High valuation items: 3 (97), 1 (92), 0 (79)
  - Allocate items: [1, 3]

- **Agent 2:**
  - High valuation items: 1 (97), 0 (96), 2 (91)
  - Allocate items: [0, 2]

- **Agent 3:**
  - High valuation items: 5 (85), 1 (73), 2 (73)
  - Allocate items: [4, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while trying to keep the total number of items distributed at 8.

### Final JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the value each agent receives and aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
