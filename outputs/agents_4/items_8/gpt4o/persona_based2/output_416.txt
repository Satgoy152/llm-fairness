Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  93  26  17  60  45  29  13
1  82  17  63  24  12  64  76  43
2  78   3  43  88  36  20  96   0
3  61  87  34  69  94  82  54  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as balanced as possible in terms of the agents' valuations, while also keeping the allocation envy-free to the extent possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**  
   Sum the valuations for each agent across all items.

2. **Initial Allocation:**  
   Distribute items to agents in a way that maximizes their valuation. Start by giving each agent their highest-valued item, while ensuring that no item is allocated to more than one agent.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**  
   Once each agent has at least one item, adjust the allocation to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's apply this approach:

### Agents' Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 75 + 93 + 26 + 17 + 60 + 45 + 29 + 13 = 358
- Agent 1: 82 + 17 + 63 + 24 + 12 + 64 + 76 + 43 = 381
- Agent 2: 78 + 3 + 43 + 88 + 36 + 20 + 96 + 0 = 364
- Agent 3: 61 + 87 + 34 + 69 + 94 + 82 + 54 + 64 = 545

### Initial Allocation:
1. **Agent 3:** gets item 4 (highest value 94), item 1 (second highest value 87), and item 3 (third highest value 69).
2. **Agent 2:** gets item 6 (highest value 96) and item 2 (second highest value 43).
3. **Agent 1:** gets item 0 (highest value 82) and item 5 (second highest value 64).
4. **Agent 0:** gets item 7 (remaining item, value 13).

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [6, 2]
- Agent 3: [4, 1, 3]

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed amongst the agents, with attention to maximizing each agent's valuation of their allocated items while striving for a balanced distribution in terms of overall valuation.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [4, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with at least one item and attempts to balance overall satisfaction based on their valuations, considering their highest preferences wherever possible.
