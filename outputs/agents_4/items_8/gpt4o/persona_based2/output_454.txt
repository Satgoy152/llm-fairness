Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  78  88  69  13  94  56  15
1  57  80  99   2   2  70  30  84
2  30  85  20  19  48  98  65   6
3  77  20  13  72  69  74  92  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [77 20 13 72 69 74 92 93]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them such that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation, given the constraints.

Here are the valuations for clarity:

- Agent 0: [80, 78, 88, 69, 13, 94, 56, 15]
- Agent 1: [57, 80, 99, 2, 2, 70, 30, 84]
- Agent 2: [30, 85, 20, 19, 48, 98, 65, 6]
- Agent 3: [77, 20, 13, 72, 69, 74, 92, 93]

A fair division strategy is to assign items to the agents who value them the most while considering envy-freeness. However, it may not be possible to achieve absolute envy-freeness, so we'll aim to minimize it.

Let's proceed with allocating the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (80).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (85).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (99).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (72).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (69).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (98).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (92).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

8. **Item 7**:
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (93).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Let's summarize these allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 5.
- Agent 3 gets items 3, 4, 6, and 7.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
