Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  62  54   0   9  18  62  44
1  83  30  91  47  57  63  10   3
2  47   9  49  44  36  28  45  79
3  20  17  42  26   6  59   6  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not always be possible in practice, especially with discrete items and differing valuations.

Let's allocate the items by considering each agent's preferences and balancing the total value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritizing items with higher valuations, Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 6. Let's assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 2. Let's assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values items 7 and 0. Let's assign these items to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent is left with the remaining less-valued items, so let's assign items 3, 4, and 5 to Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agentâ€™s perceived value from their assigned items while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7, 0],
    "3": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This distribution uses all 8 items and ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
