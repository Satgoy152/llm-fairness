Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  17  26  56  17  94  25  93
1  15   7  87  99  20  95   9  51
2   1  12  41  92  93  85  47  79
3  80  61  59  83  53  45  22  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent should ideally receive 2 items since there are 4 agents and 8 items.
   - We need to ensure that the allocation minimizes envy among the agents, which means each agent should feel they could not have done better by swapping their allocation with another agent.

2. **Valuation Analysis**:
   - Agent 0 seems to value items 5 and 7 highly (94 and 93).
   - Agent 1 places high value on items 3 and 5 (99 and 95).
   - Agent 2 highly values items 4 and 3 (93 and 92).
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (80) followed by item 3 (83).

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate the highest valued items to agents based on their top preferences, ensuring each agent gets a fair allocation based on their highest values.

4. **Fair Allocation**:
   - Assign items to agents while considering their highest valuations and ensuring each agent gets 2 items.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets items 5 and 7.
   - Agent 1 gets items 3 and 2.
   - Agent 2 gets items 4 and 6.
   - Agent 3 gets items 0 and 1.

This allocation is designed to be envy-free as much as possible given their valuations. Each agent receives a set of items they highly value.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair portion of the total valuation, minimizing potential envy based on the given valuations.
