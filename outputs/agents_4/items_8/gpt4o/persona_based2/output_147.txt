Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  37  12  25   3  38  49  64
1  41  53  10  28  73  47  35  30
2   2  12  83  42  52  63  27  96
3  42  12  44  89  78  24  17  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, we aim to balance the distribution based on the agents' valuations, ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. This usually involves maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocation.

Let's approach this problem by focusing on ensuring fairness and attempting to distribute items such that agents receive items they highly value.

### Step 1: Determine Initial Allocations

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High values for items 0 (88) and 7 (64)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High values for items 4 (73) and 1 (53)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High values for items 7 (96) and 2 (83)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High values for items 3 (89) and 4 (78)

### Step 2: Allocate Items

Let's allocate items based on the highest preferences first, considering each agent's satisfaction and ensuring all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 7. These are highly valued by Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1 and 4. These are highly valued by Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 2 and 5. These provide a balance of the remaining high values.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 3 and 6. These items, although not the highest, provide balance and fairness considering previous allocations.

### Step 3: Final Allocations

After balancing and ensuring all items are fairly distributed, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution aims to minimize envy by aligning with high valuations where possible.
