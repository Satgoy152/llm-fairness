Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  85  86  72  58  60  39  15
1  30  87  33  76  88  54  97  56
2  45  78  93  89  57  48  76  61
3  36  36  11  89  29  46  16  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation.

To achieve this, we will:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items collectively.
2. Try to assign items in a way that balances these total values among agents, ensuring that no agent envies another.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 36 + 85 + 86 + 72 + 58 + 60 + 39 + 15 = 451
- Agent 1: 30 + 87 + 33 + 76 + 88 + 54 + 97 + 56 = 521
- Agent 2: 45 + 78 + 93 + 89 + 57 + 48 + 76 + 61 = 547
- Agent 3: 36 + 36 + 11 + 89 + 29 + 46 + 16 + 31 = 294

Next, we allocate the items to balance these total values, aiming for each agent to receive approximately the same total value of items.

Let's allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate item 2 (value 86) and item 0 (value 36). Total = 122.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate item 4 (value 88) and item 6 (value 97). Total = 185.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate item 1 (value 78), item 3 (value 89), and item 7 (value 61). Total = 228.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocate item 5 (value 46). Total = 46.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 0] with values 86, 36; total = 122
- Agent 1: [4, 6] with values 88, 97; total = 185
- Agent 2: [1, 3, 7] with values 78, 89, 61; total = 228
- Agent 3: [5] with value 46; total = 46

This allocation attempts to balance the total values perceived by each agent, though achieving perfect envy-freeness might be challenging with discrete items and varying valuations.

Finally, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 7],
    "3": [5]
}
```
