Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  44  16  81  82  72  86   4
1  22  50  61  86  94  89  51  93
2  16  19  21  74  38  15  52  75
3  25  11  56  99  11  10  90  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, one approach is to use the method of maximum marginal utility, where each agent is allocated the item they value the most that has not been allocated yet. This approach helps to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, thereby reducing potential envy.

Let's consider the agents and their valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations - 6 (value 86), 4 (value 82), 3 (value 81)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations - 4 (value 94), 3 (value 86), 7 (value 93)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations - 7 (value 75), 3 (value 74), 6 (value 52)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations - 3 (value 99), 6 (value 90), 7 (value 57)

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuations of unallocated items:

1. **First Round of Allocation**:
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (value 99), so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (value 94), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most (value 86), so allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 7 the most (value 75), so allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

2. **Second Round of Allocation**:
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 2, 5
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value 69), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (value 89), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value 21), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (value 11), so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent has received items in a manner that reflects their preferences, while ensuring that all items have been allocated.

Here are the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are allocated.
