Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  13  87  58  30  69  43  17
1  50  26  83  42  49  14  86  41
2  62   3  53  41  25  71  42  36
3  74  14  71  73  32  53  60  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuations and attempts to maximize their satisfaction by ensuring that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations table, let's try to allocate items in a way that no agent envies another. The agents' values for each item are:

- Agent 0: [88, 13, 87, 58, 30, 69, 43, 17]
- Agent 1: [50, 26, 83, 42, 49, 14, 86, 41]
- Agent 2: [62, 3, 53, 41, 25, 71, 42, 36]
- Agent 3: [74, 14, 71, 73, 32, 53, 60, 46]

Let's start by allocating items based on the highest personal valuations for each agent to minimize envy, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair number of items.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items are 0 (88) and 2 (87). 
   - Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items are 6 (86) and 2 (83), but item 2 is already taken. 
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items are 5 (71) and 0 (62), but item 0 is already taken.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items are 3 (73) and 0 (74), but item 0 is already taken.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 4, and 7) to minimize envy:

- **Remaining Items**: 1, 4, 7

5. **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest value item is 5 (69), but it's taken, so consider item 1 (13). 
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Next highest value item is 7 (41), which is available.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - The remaining item is 4.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3**:
   - Already allocated 3, so no additional allocation needed.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 1],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring that all items are allocated.
