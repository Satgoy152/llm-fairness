Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  93  16  25  53  86  20  98
1  88  56  95  72  41  67  98  19
2  84  16  10  62  27  81  71  26
3  83   8  91  41  16  91  95  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that is fair and envy-free, we can use a method known as the "round-robin" approach, which ensures that each agent gets a chance to pick items in a sequence based on their preferences.

We start by analyzing the valuation matrix to determine the order of item selection for each agent. This can be done by allowing each agent to choose their most valued remaining item in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** selects item 7 (value 98).
2. **Agent 1** selects item 6 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2** selects item 5 (value 81).
4. **Agent 3** selects item 2 (value 91).

5. **Agent 0** selects item 1 (value 93).
6. **Agent 1** selects item 2 (value 95), but item 2 is taken; selects item 0 (value 88).
7. **Agent 2** selects item 0 (value 84), but item 0 is taken; selects item 3 (value 62).
8. **Agent 3** selects item 5 (value 91), but item 5 is taken; selects item 6 (value 95), but item 6 is taken; selects item 4 (value 16).

After these selections, all items are allocated, and each agent gets two items. This ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations available in their turn, promoting fairness and minimizing envy.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, thereby balancing fairness and reducing the chance of envy among the agents.
