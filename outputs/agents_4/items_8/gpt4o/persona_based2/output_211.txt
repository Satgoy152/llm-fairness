Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  44  79  14   8  38  69  39
1  37  44  51   8  47  47  44  19
2  91  18  37  27  49  84  96  21
3  33   5  92   6  74  87  87  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations. An envy-free allocation means that each agent believes that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation.

Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**  
   Each agent has a total valuation for all items that we can compute by summing the values in their respective rows.

2. **Sort Items by Valuation for Each Agent:**  
   For each agent, sort the items based on how much they value them. This helps us prioritize what items to allocate to each agent.

3. **Iterative Allocation:**  
   Allocate items one by one, starting with the item most valued by any particular agent, ensuring that no agent is significantly worse off than another as we proceed.

4. **Adjust for Fairness:**  
   After the initial allocation, check for obvious disparities and adjust allocations to minimize envy, if necessary.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:**

   - Agent 0: 81 + 44 + 79 + 14 + 8 + 38 + 69 + 39 = 372
   - Agent 1: 37 + 44 + 51 + 8 + 47 + 47 + 44 + 19 = 297
   - Agent 2: 91 + 18 + 37 + 27 + 49 + 84 + 96 + 21 = 423
   - Agent 3: 33 + 5 + 92 + 6 + 74 + 87 + 87 + 49 = 433

2. **Sort Items by Valuation for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: [0, 2, 6, 1, 7, 5, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1: [2, 1, 5, 4, 6, 0, 7, 3]
   - Agent 2: [6, 0, 5, 4, 2, 3, 7, 1]
   - Agent 3: [2, 5, 6, 4, 7, 0, 3, 1]

3. **Initial Allocation:**

   We can start by giving each agent their most valued item, then continue to allocate to minimize envy.

   - Agent 0: [0] (81)
   - Agent 1: [2] (51)
   - Agent 2: [6] (96)
   - Agent 3: [5] (87)

4. **Remaining Items: 1, 3, 4, 7**

   Next, we continue to allocate the remaining items considering each agent's ranking:

   - Agent 0 takes item 1 (44)
   - Agent 3 takes item 4 (74)
   - Agent 2 takes item 3 (27)
   - Agent 1 takes item 7 (19)

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [2, 7]
- Agent 2: [6, 3]
- Agent 3: [5, 4]

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```
