Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  66  13  77  11  29  79   0
1  84  57  45  80  20  17  25  52
2  31  45  15  34   6  43  41  33
3  20  18  22  24  11  19  15  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the integer constraint. Envy-free means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 16 + 66 + 13 + 77 + 11 + 29 + 79 + 0 = 291
- Agent 1's total value: 84 + 57 + 45 + 80 + 20 + 17 + 25 + 52 = 380
- Agent 2's total value: 31 + 45 + 15 + 34 + 6 + 43 + 41 + 33 = 248
- Agent 3's total value: 20 + 18 + 22 + 24 + 11 + 19 + 15 + 76 = 205

Next, let's consider how to allocate the items such that each agent gets a portion of the items that they value highly, while also making sure each agent gets an integer number of items.

A straightforward strategy is to allocate items based on the highest relative value (value per item) for each agent. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valued items: 6 (79), 3 (77)
   - Allocation: [6, 3]

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valued items: 0 (84), 3 (80) (3 already taken), 1 (57)
   - Allocation: [0, 1]

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (43), 7 (33)
   - Allocation: [5, 7]

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest valued items: 7 (76) (7 already taken), 2 (22)
   - Allocation: [2, 4]

This distribution ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy. Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 4]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least two items, with their most valued items included.
