Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  98  81  30  69  45  71  37
1  29  98  61  19  21  87  75  20
2  58  66  42  25  70  33  18  25
3  39  83  78  87  49  88  30  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we seek to minimize envy and distribute the items based on their valuations. One common goal is to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step procedure to reach a fair allocation:

1. **Total Valuation Calculation**: Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating the item with the highest valuation to each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
3. **Refinement**: Adjust the allocation to ensure that the total number of items allocated equals 8, while considering envy-freeness.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (98).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (98) as well, but since Agent 0 takes item 1, Agent 1's next best option is item 5 (87).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (70).
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (88).

Now, given that some items are already allocated and each agent should get at least one item, refine the allocation to distribute the remaining items fairly:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 1. Next best is item 6 (71).
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 5. Next best is item 6 (75), but it's taken, so choose item 2 (61).
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 4. Next best is item 0 (58).
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 5. Next best is item 3 (87).

However, this initial allocation needs to be adjusted to ensure all items are allocated and each agent has items that maximize their overall utility.

### Final Allocation:

The aim is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share, taking into account the order of preferences wherever possible.

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 0, which is one of their higher valued items not taken by others.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, both of which they value highly.
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 7, ensuring they have a fair share based on their valuation.
- Agent 3 receives items 3, 5, and 6, maximizing their utility given the constraints.

This allocation aims to be envy-free and ensures all items are distributed.
