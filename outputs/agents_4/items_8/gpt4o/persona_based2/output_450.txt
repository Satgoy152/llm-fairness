Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  91  48   1  71  11  73  82
1  76  41  18  35  60  74  32  42
2  31  59  16   7  51  60  98  35
3  84  85  35  57  36  11  25  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that reduces envy and ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. An effective way to do this is to compute the total value each agent assigns to all items and then attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives a similar total value.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 71 + 91 + 48 + 1 + 71 + 11 + 73 + 82 = 448
- Agent 1: 76 + 41 + 18 + 35 + 60 + 74 + 32 + 42 = 378
- Agent 2: 31 + 59 + 16 + 7 + 51 + 60 + 98 + 35 = 357
- Agent 3: 84 + 85 + 35 + 57 + 36 + 11 + 25 + 52 = 385

Next, we distribute the items considering each agent's valuation to minimize envy and maximize individual satisfaction. A possible allocation can be:

1. Assign items to agents based on their preference, starting from the highest value.
2. Ensure each agent ends up with an equal or near-equal number of items.

After evaluating the options, the allocation can be organized as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly, so they get item 1. They also value item 7, so they get item 7.
- Agent 1 can get item 5, which they value highly. They also receive item 0.
- Agent 2 values item 6 significantly, so they get item 6, and they also get item 4.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly and can also get item 2.

This allocation leads to the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```

This distribution aims to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their preferences, while ensuring that each agent gets at least two items.
