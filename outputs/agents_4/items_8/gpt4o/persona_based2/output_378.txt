Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  43  64  46   2  52  43  15
1   0  26  38  87   2   8  51  98
2  41  94   0  74  54  15  12  28
3  25   4  91  17  39  17  31  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [25  4 91 17 39 17 31 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the distribution is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations, can be complex. Instead, we'll focus on a fair division that attempts to minimize envy and distribute items in a balanced way.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0:  [22, 43, 64, 46,  2, 52, 43, 15]
Agent 1:  [ 0, 26, 38, 87,  2,  8, 51, 98]
Agent 2:  [41, 94,  0, 74, 54, 15, 12, 28]
Agent 3:  [25,  4, 91, 17, 39, 17, 31, 89]
```

We will follow a strategy to distribute items in a balanced manner.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Highest Valuation Approach:** Each agent should ideally receive items that they value highly. We will start by allocating each agent their highest valued item and then proceed from there to balance the valuations.

2. **Balancing Values:** After assigning the highest valued item, the remaining items will be distributed to ensure that the value each agent receives is roughly balanced.

### Step-by-Step Allocation

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is item 2 with value 64.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is item 7 with value 98.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is item 1 with value 94.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value is item 2 with value 91, but it's taken, so next is item 7 with value 89, but it's also taken. Next candidate is item 3 with value 17.

After initial allocation, the remaining items are 0, 4, 5, 6, and we will distribute these to achieve balance.

5. **Agent 0:** Next highest available is item 0 (22).
6. **Agent 1:** Next highest available is item 6 (51).
7. **Agent 2:** Next highest available is item 4 (54).
8. **Agent 3:** Remaining item is 5 (17).

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent's interest in high-valued items is respected.
