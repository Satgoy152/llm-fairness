Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  75  21  82  80  60  75  72
1  90  12  61  18  54  43  83  21
2  90  33  12   8  93  37  98  56
3  79   7  55  21  57  31  52   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy among agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or using a round-robin method based on valuations. Since we want to assign all 8 items fairly, we need to consider the valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the valuations, let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 51 + 75 + 21 + 82 + 80 + 60 + 75 + 72 = 516
- Agent 1: 90 + 12 + 61 + 18 + 54 + 43 + 83 + 21 = 382
- Agent 2: 90 + 33 + 12 + 8 + 93 + 37 + 98 + 56 = 427
- Agent 3: 79 + 7 + 55 + 21 + 57 + 31 + 52 + 7 = 309

Let's proceed with a round-robin allocation method based on descending order of total valuation, which helps in distributing items fairly:

1. First, assign the highest-valued item to each agent in order of their total valuation preference.
2. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value items: 3 (82), 4 (80)
2. **Agent 2:** Highest value items: 6 (98), 4 (93)
3. **Agent 1:** Highest value items: 0 (90)
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value items: 0 (79)

Continuing in a round-robin fashion while ensuring no duplication and considering preferences:

- Agent 0: already has items 3, 4; next highest: 1 (75)
- Agent 1: already has item 0; next highest: 6 (83)
- Agent 2: already has items 6, 4; next highest: 7 (56)
- Agent 3: already has item 0; next highest: 2 (55)

Adjusting for balance:

- Agent 0: [3, 4, 1]
- Agent 1: [0, 6]
- Agent 2: [7, 5]
- Agent 3: [2]

Rechecking total items allocated: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 items in total.

Now, presenting the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```
