Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  74  65  82  49  13  81  72
1  78  60  69  49  91  83  61  13
2   7  10  20  60  98  37  43  30
3  46  68  22  96  64  16  31  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own. In practice, achieving exact envy-freeness might be challenging, especially with integer allocations, but we can strive to minimize envy. Let's consider the valuations of each agent for the items and attempt to distribute them accordingly. 

Here is a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 2
   - Total valuation: 86 (Item 0) + 65 (Item 2) = 151

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1, 4
   - Total valuation: 60 (Item 1) + 91 (Item 4) = 151

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 5
   - Total valuation: 37 (Item 5) = 37

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: 3, 6, 7
   - Total valuation: 96 (Item 3) + 31 (Item 6) + 98 (Item 7) = 225

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations among the agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, thereby distributing the items in a manner that minimizes overall envy.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6, 7]
}
```
