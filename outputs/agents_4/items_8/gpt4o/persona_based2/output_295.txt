Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  95  61  25  88   4  26  33
1  93  60   0  60  84  52  66  51
2  64  31  67  62  69  74  97   9
3  48  61  36  56  25  64  86  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider their valuations and try to distribute the items such that no agent envies another’s allocation. This is a complex problem, but we can use the maximum valuation strategy, considering that each agent should be satisfied with their own allocation relative to others based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Each agent should get items they value highly to minimize envy. We’ll start by giving each agent the item they value the most, if possible.

2. **Iterative Allocation:** After the first round, continue to assign remaining items to the agents who value them highly, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness:** After initial allocations, verify and adjust if any agent envies the allocation of another.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items:** Item 1 (95), Item 4 (88)
2. **Agent 1's highest valued items:** Item 0 (93), Item 4 (84)
3. **Agent 2's highest valued items:** Item 6 (97), Item 5 (74)
4. **Agent 3's highest valued items:** Item 6 (86), Item 5 (64)

Based on this, perform an initial allocation and adjust:

- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2 (highest value of 97)
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value of 93)
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value of 95)
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (high value of 88)
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (second-highest value of 74)
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (value of 60)
- Allocate Item 7 to Agent 3 (best available option)
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (value of 61)

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4, 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 6, 5
- Agent 3: Item 7

This allocation tries to maximize individual satisfaction (based on initial high valuations) and distribute items fairly to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Here’s the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [7]
}
```
