Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65   9   3  21  77  14   8   0
1   0  93  83  91  31   0  81  31
2  40  52  25  79  70   5  72  87
3  36  80  36  99  19  11  19  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents while considering envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use the maximum envy-free allocation principle. This involves ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as much as possible relative to others.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Identify Total Valuation**: Calculate the total value each agent places on all items to understand their preferences.
   
   - Agent 0: 65 + 9 + 3 + 21 + 77 + 14 + 8 + 0 = 197
   - Agent 1: 0 + 93 + 83 + 91 + 31 + 0 + 81 + 31 = 410
   - Agent 2: 40 + 52 + 25 + 79 + 70 + 5 + 72 + 87 = 430
   - Agent 3: 36 + 80 + 36 + 99 + 19 + 11 + 19 + 31 = 331

2. **Allocate Based on Highest Valuation**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets two items since there are 8 items and 4 agents.

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values highest (65)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values highest (93)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values highest (83)
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values highest (99)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values highest (77)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values highest (14)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values highest (81)
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values highest (87)

3. **Reallocate for Fairness**: Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives 2 items, aiming to balance envy and fairness.

   Revised Allocation:
   
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 4
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2
   - Agent 2: Items 6, 7
   - Agent 3: Items 3, 5

Final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and it attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on the agents' highest valuations while maintaining a balance in the number of items each agent receives.
