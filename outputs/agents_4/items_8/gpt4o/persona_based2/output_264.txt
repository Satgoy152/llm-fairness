Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  40  69  20  56  62  38  71
1  11  13  54  57  48  55   6  13
2  20  77   8  77  80  18  87  13
3  99  80  31  97  17  27  84  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a method called "round-robin" or "sequential allocation." This method involves each agent taking turns to pick the most valuable item available from their perspective until all items are allocated.

Let's implement this approach:

1. **Agent 0** values item 7 the highest (71), so they pick item 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (57), so they pick item 3.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (80), so they pick item 4.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest (99), so they pick item 0.

Now, we repeat the process for the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0** now values item 2 the highest (69), so they pick item 2.
6. **Agent 1** now values item 5 the highest (55), so they pick item 5.
7. **Agent 2** now values item 6 the highest (87), so they pick item 6.
8. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest (80), so they pick item 1.

Now all items have been allocated. Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

These allocations ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
