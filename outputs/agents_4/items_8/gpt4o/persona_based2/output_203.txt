Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  77  29  94   3  28  11   3
1  12  96  27  45  41  70  64  93
2  86  22  66  21  33  77  64  23
3  33  88  49  16  41  72  77  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation where each agent receives a set of items such that no agent envies another. This is a challenging condition to achieve perfectly, but we can attempt to minimize envy by considering the valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation by evaluating the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations**: 
   - Item 3: 94
   - Item 0: 82
   - Item 1: 77

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations**:
   - Item 1: 96
   - Item 7: 93
   - Item 5: 70

3. **Agent 2's highest valuations**:
   - Item 0: 86
   - Item 5: 77
   - Item 2: 66

4. **Agent 3's highest valuations**:
   - Item 6: 77
   - Item 1: 88
   - Item 5: 72

Given these valuations, let's try to ensure that each agent gets items with high relative value to them, and ensure all 8 items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly and are not highly valued by others. Items 3 and 0 are high on Agent 0's list and less competitive, so we allocate them to Agent 0.
  
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1 and 7 to Agent 1, as these are among the highest valued for Agent 1 and less valued by others.

- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 to Agent 2, as it is highly valued by Agent 2 and has moderate competition. Additionally, allocate item 2 to Agent 2 as it has a decent value and less competition.

- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6 to Agent 3, as it is the highest value item available for this agent and not highly desired by others. Also, allocate item 4 to balance the allocation.

### Final Allocation

The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 0
- Agent 1: Items 1, 7
- Agent 2: Items 5, 2
- Agent 3: Items 6, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and minimizes envy to the greatest extent possible given the constraints.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [6, 4]
}
```
This allocation tries to reflect the relative valuations of the agents as closely as possible while ensuring that each agent receives items.
