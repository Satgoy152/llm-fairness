Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84   3   0  35  10  54  27  89
1  99  60  30  34  37  18  68  95
2  86  55  92  71  12  86  12  14
3   1   5  83  53  26  59  75  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a method that tries to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

Given the valuations of the items by each agent, let's try to allocate the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 0: Item 7 (89), Item 0 (84), Item 5 (54).
   - Allocate Item 7 and Item 0 to Agent 0 for a total value of 173.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 1: Item 0 (99), Item 7 (95), Item 1 (60).
   - Allocating Item 7 to Agent 0, allocate Item 1 and Item 0 to Agent 1 for a total value of 159.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 2: Item 2 (92), Item 5 (86), Item 3 (71).
   - Allocate Item 2 and Item 5 to Agent 2 for a total value of 178.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 3: Item 2 (83), Item 6 (75), Item 5 (59).
   - Allocating Item 2 and Item 5 to Agent 2, allocate Item 6 and Item 3 to Agent 3 for a total value of 128.

### Final Allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [7, 0]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 5]
- **Agent 3**: Items [6, 3]

This allocation ensures each agent has a valuable set of items while minimizing potential envy. Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's valuations and attempts to distribute the items in a balanced manner to maintain fairness and reduce envy.
