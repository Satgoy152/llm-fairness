Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13   4  34  27  49  46  98  95
1  97  27  90  95  46  27  48  97
2  31  36  78  96  46  56  42  78
3  93  59  86   5   0  79  38   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness and attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. However, given the constraints of having integer allocations and ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent, we may not achieve perfect envy-freeness.

One approach is to use a round-robin or maximin strategy, where each agent takes turns selecting their most valued item that is still available. Let's work through the process:

1. Identify the highest-valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most (98).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (97).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (96).
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the most (93).

2. Assign the highest-valued items:
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 and Agent 3 both want item 0, and there is no clear tie-breaking rule, we assign it to the agent with the next highest available item).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 will need to choose the next most valued available item.

3. Continue assigning items based on the highest remaining value for each agent:
   - Agent 0's next highest is item 7 (95).
   - Agent 1's next highest is item 7 (97), but since Agent 0 has already taken it, Agent 1 takes item 2 (90).
   - Agent 2's next highest available is item 7 (78).
   - Agent 3's next highest available is item 2 (86), but it's taken. Next highest is item 5 (79).

4. Final allocations:
   - Agent 0: Items 6, 7
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 2
   - Agent 2: Items 3, 4
   - Agent 3: Items 1, 5

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, while attempting to minimize envy.

{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
