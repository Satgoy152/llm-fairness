Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  20  51  29  91  28  62  77
1  73  73  28  54  66  94  66  29
2  54  25  57  29  35  28  47  74
3  84  69  19  24  23  16  32  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, let's consider some of the typical fair division algorithms. One such method is the "round-robin" allocation, where items are allocated sequentially based on the agents' preferences. 

However, given the valuations, a more careful approach is needed to minimize envy and ensure all agents feel they have received a fair share. A common goal is to minimize the maximum envy, which is the maximum difference in valuation any agent feels compared to another agent's allocation.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High value on item 4 (91) and moderate values on items 2 (51) and 7 (77).
2. **Agent 1**: High value on item 5 (94) and items 0, 1 (73 each).
3. **Agent 2**: Moderate values across several items.
4. **Agent 3**: High value on item 0 (84) and item 1 (69).

Given these insights, we can assign:

- **Agent 0**: Items with the highest value - 4, 2, 7.
- **Agent 1**: Items with the highest value - 5, 0.
- **Agent 2**: Items with moderate values - 3, 6.
- **Agent 3**: Item with the highest value - 1.

This allocation balances the high-value items with a consideration for each agent's valuation across items.

Here's the distribution in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 7],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items according to their highest valuations, minimizing potential envy.
