Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  90  29  78  94   4  89  94
1   2  28   1  10  30  59  76  55
2   0  34  80  53  97  62  64  30
3   9  42  87  68  40  79  10  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents in a way that ensures fairness and envy-freeness as much as possible. A common approach to achieve this is the "Round Robin" method, where each agent takes turns picking the most valuable item to them until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 4 (value 94).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 6 (value 76).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 4 (value 97), but it's already taken; picks item 2 (value 80).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 2 (value 87), but it's already taken; picks item 7 (value 86).

Starting the second round:

5. **Agent 0** picks item 1 (value 90).
6. **Agent 1** picks item 5 (value 59).
7. **Agent 2** picks item 3 (value 53).
8. **Agent 3** picks item 5 (value 79), but it's already taken; picks item 3 (value 68), but it's already taken; picks item 0 (value 9).

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [4, 1]
- Agent 1: [6, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]
- Agent 3: [7, 0]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [7, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the preferences of the agents, though achieving complete envy-freeness can be challenging with discrete items and varying valuations.
