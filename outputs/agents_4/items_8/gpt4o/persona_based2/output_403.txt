Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  51  47  63  80  29  85   8
1  69  74  85  80  12  13  13  24
2  32  94   4  48  29  39  49  47
3  84  61  31  14  34  80  81  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [84 61 31 14 34 80 81 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy among agents. One possible approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) method, which seeks to maximize the product of each agent's utility.

Let's consider the valuations given in the table:

Agent 0: [2, 51, 47, 63, 80, 29, 85, 8]
Agent 1: [69, 74, 85, 80, 12, 13, 13, 24]
Agent 2: [32, 94, 4, 48, 29, 39, 49, 47]
Agent 3: [84, 61, 31, 14, 34, 80, 81, 35]

A potential fair allocation could be as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most, so we assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most, so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most, so we assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most, so we assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, let's assign the remaining items, considering the remaining highest valuations:

- Agent 0: Out of the remaining items, Agent 0 values item 4 the highest, so we assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Out of the remaining items, Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, so we assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Out of the remaining items, Agent 2 values item 7 the highest, so we assign item 7 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3: Out of the remaining items, Agent 3 values item 5 the highest, so we assign item 5 to Agent 3.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

Each agent gets two items, and all 8 items are allocated. This allocation aims to maximize the utility for each agent based on their highest valuations.
