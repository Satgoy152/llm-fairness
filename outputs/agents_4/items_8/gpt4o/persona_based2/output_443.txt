Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  82  85  29  87  61  49  23
1  60  61  91   0  86  32  79  56
2  53  53  75  85  52  99  50  69
3  39  45  62  93  12  95  57  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, where no agent envies another agent's allocation if at most one item is removed from the envied agent's bundle.

Given the valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets items such that the total valuation is as balanced as possible.

Let's evaluate a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: 0, 1, 2
   - Total valuation: 37 + 82 + 85 = 204

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items: 4, 6
   - Total valuation: 86 + 79 = 165

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items: 5
   - Total valuation: 99

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items: 3, 7
   - Total valuation: 93 + 74 = 167

This allocation aims to distribute the total value in a way that balances the valuations across agents. While achieving perfect envy-freeness is complex, this allocation attempts to balance the perceived value of each agent's allocated items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
