Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  92  40   7  98  41   4  54
1  50  46  77  39  40   3  58  62
2  48  10  63  62  10  12  40  60
3  37  17  99   1  49  80  35  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and strive to distribute the items so that no agent envies another based on their subjective valuations. We aim to achieve an allocation where each agent perceives their share as at least as valuable as any other agent's share.

Given the valuation matrix, let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** seems to value item 4 highly (98) and item 1 (92). 
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 (77) and item 7 (62) significantly.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively balanced valuations, but item 3 (62) and item 7 (60) are among the higher preferences.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (99) and item 5 (80).

Taking these preferences into account, we can proceed with an allocation that attempts to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 4 (total perceived value: 190)
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 7 (total perceived value: 139)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 and 0 (total perceived value: 124)
- **Agent 3**: Items 5 and 6 (total perceived value: 115)

This allocation gives each agent two items, and ensures that the total number of items allocated is eight. This allocation also tries to respect the highest preferences of each agent, which helps in minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
