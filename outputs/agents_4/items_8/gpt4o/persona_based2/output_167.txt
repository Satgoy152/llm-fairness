Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  14  53  69  25  39   6  54
1  14  69  86   7   1  48   7  88
2  54  70  77  73  36  46  45  56
3  94  10  37  41   5  69   5  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent based on their valuations.

We have 4 agents and 8 items, which means ideally each agent should receive 2 items. However, the central aim is to minimize envy while ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their valuation.

Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 0 (71), Item 3 (69)
   - Allocate items 0 and 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 2 (86), Item 7 (88)
   - Allocate items 2 and 7 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 1 (70), Item 4 (36)
   - Allocate items 1 and 4 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: Item 5 (69), Item 6 (5)
   - Allocate items 5 and 6 to agent 3.

This allocation attempts to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives 2 items. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and it minimizes potential envy by allocating items preferred by each agent based on their individual valuations.
