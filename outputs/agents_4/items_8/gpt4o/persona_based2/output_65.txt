Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  93  27  30  11  76  57  36
1  60  82  71  39  71  57  34  63
2  33  46  16  80  78  48  73  25
3  59  35  41  32  81  36  15  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, which means no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the provided valuations, we'll try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 and item 4. Let's allocate these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 and item 6 highly. Let's allocate these items to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 7. Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (0, 5, and 4):

- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 1, who has a relatively high valuation for it compared to others.
- **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 0, as they value it highly.
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 3, who values it highly.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, maintaining a sense of fairness and minimizing envy among agents.
