Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  91  57  26  53  59  48  77
1  15  46  40  99   8  85  64  60
2  27  37  98  84  75   6  36  94
3  14  30  71  63  35  46  30  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, I will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences.

First, let's calculate the total value for each agent and then determine the approximate share each should get:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 66 + 91 + 57 + 26 + 53 + 59 + 48 + 77 = 477
- Agent 1's total valuation: 15 + 46 + 40 + 99 + 8 + 85 + 64 + 60 = 417
- Agent 2's total valuation: 27 + 37 + 98 + 84 + 75 + 6 + 36 + 94 = 457
- Agent 3's total valuation: 14 + 30 + 71 + 63 + 35 + 46 + 30 + 44 = 333

Total valuation of all items for all agents = 1684

Each agent's fair share (ideal value they should receive) is calculated by dividing their total valuation by the total valuation of all agents and multiplying by the total number of items (8):

- Agent 0's fair share: (477 / 1684) * 8 ≈ 2.26 items
- Agent 1's fair share: (417 / 1684) * 8 ≈ 1.98 items
- Agent 2's fair share: (457 / 1684) * 8 ≈ 2.17 items
- Agent 3's fair share: (333 / 1684) * 8 ≈ 1.58 items

Since each agent must receive an integer number of items, we will round these values and allocate items based on valuations. Let's allocate as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1 and item 0, allocate these items to agent 0.  
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 3 and item 5, so these items should be allocated to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 and item 7 highly, so allocate these items to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has moderate valuations across items, but item 6 and item 4 are left, so assign these to agent 3.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1] (valuations 66, 91)
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5] (valuations 99, 85)
- Agent 2: Items [2, 7] (valuations 98, 94)
- Agent 3: Items [4, 6] (valuations 35, 30)

This allocation attempts to respect the individual valuations and gives each agent items in line with their fair share.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
