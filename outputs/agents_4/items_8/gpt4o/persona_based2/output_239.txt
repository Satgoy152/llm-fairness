Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  64  90  92  19  15  16  29
1  23  12  93  28   5  41  21  75
2  25   8  19   3  59  66  71  17
3  13  27  24  22  79  23  25   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use principles from fair division, such as maximizing the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations. Envy-freeness is often an important consideration, ensuring that no agent would prefer to have another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
Agent 0: [54, 64, 90, 92, 19, 15, 16, 29]
Agent 1: [23, 12, 93, 28, 5, 41, 21, 75]
Agent 2: [25, 8, 19, 3, 59, 66, 71, 17]
Agent 3: [13, 27, 24, 22, 79, 23, 25, 5]
```

We should aim for each agent to receive items that provide them with the highest utility while also ensuring that the distribution is envy-free as much as possible. Here's a step-by-step strategy to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent.** This will help in making sure that each agent is satisfied to the greatest extent possible with their allocation.

2. **Allocate items by priority of highest valuation.** Start allocating items in such a way that agents receive their highest valued items without causing significant envy among others.

3. **Iterate to balance allocations.** Adjust allocations to balance the distribution and ensure no agent ends up with significantly more or less value than others.

Let's perform a fair allocation based on this strategy:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (92) and item 2 (90).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (93) and item 7 (75).
- **Agent 2** highly values item 6 (71) and item 5 (66).
- **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (79).

Based on these preferences, a fair allocation can be structured as follows, ensuring every agent gets at least one high-value item:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 1 (total value = 54 + 64 = 118)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2 and 7 (total value = 93 + 75 = 168)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 5 and 6 (total value = 66 + 71 = 137)
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 3 and 4 (total value = 22 + 79 = 101)

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total value from their perspective while ensuring each agent receives a desirable item.

Finally, here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
