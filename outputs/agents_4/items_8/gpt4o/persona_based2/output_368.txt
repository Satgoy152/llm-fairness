Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  21  75  82  60  40  78  31
1  47  83  89  61  60  80   0  77
2   9  42  27  93  95   1  30  52
3  56  91  57  92  85  23  85  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this problem, we aim to allocate items to agents such that the distribution is as fair as possible. We will strive for an envy-free allocation, where each agent believes they have received a fair share according to their valuations, but given the constraint of integer allocations, perfect envy-freeness may not be achievable. 

We'll utilize a fair division method that attempts to minimize envy, such as a round-robin or a priority-based allocation strategy that considers agents' preferences. Here, we are assigning one item at a time based on agents' highest valuations, iterating through agents until all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Initialization**: Each agent begins without any items. All items are unallocated.
2. **Priority Selection**: We will go through a round-robin process where each agent selects their most valued unallocated item.
3. **Repeat**: Continue the process until all items are allocated.

### Execution:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is 78 for item 6.
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is 89 for item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is 95 for item 4.
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is 92 for item 3.

Now, remove the allocated items and repeat the process with remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest value is 82 for item 3 (already taken), so selects item 5 with value 40.
- **Agent 1**: Next highest value is 83 for item 1.
- **Agent 2**: Next highest value is 93 for item 3 (already taken), so selects item 7 with value 52.
- **Agent 3**: Next highest value is 91 for item 1 (already taken), so selects item 0 with value 56.

### Final Allocation:

Based on the above process, the items are allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

Each agent now has two items, and all items are allocated. This allocation attempts to assign items based on agents' preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share.
