Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  41   1  41  91  94  49  55
1  64  94  28  50  64  79  95  31
2   9  34  31  37  97  61  14  50
3  78  93  58  46   9  63  97  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [78 93 58 46  9 63 97 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuation.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [12, 41, 1, 41, 91, 94, 49, 55]
Agent 1: [64, 94, 28, 50, 64, 79, 95, 31]
Agent 2: [9, 34, 31, 37, 97, 61, 14, 50]
Agent 3: [78, 93, 58, 46, 9, 63, 97, 95]
```

A reasonable approach is to prioritize assigning items that each agent values highly, as this will help in achieving envy-freeness. We will try to distribute items so that each agent receives items they value significantly. 

### Allocation Plan:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuation items: 5 (94), 4 (91)
   - Allocate item 4 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuation items: 1 (94), 6 (95)
   - Allocate item 1 and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuation items: 4 (97), 5 (61)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 values it at 50, which is relatively high compared to remaining options.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuation items: 6 (97), 7 (95)
   - Allocate item 0 and 7 to Agent 3.

Let's confirm that the allocation satisfies the constraints:
- Each agent should receive items they value highly, as much as possible.
- All 8 items are allocated.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 3, 2]
}
```

Thus, each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible, maintaining a balance to minimize envy.
