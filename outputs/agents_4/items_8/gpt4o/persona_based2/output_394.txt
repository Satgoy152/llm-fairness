Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  23  17  39  50  55  84  61
1  50   4  65  31  52  66  97  63
2  40  87  14  97  86  70  48   8
3  16  68   0  32  56  67  99  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free distribution. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation.

Let's proceed with evaluating potential allocations:

1. **Assessing Valuations:**
   - Each agent values the items differently, and we want to ensure that the allocation maximizes each agent's total value while keeping each agent satisfied with their share.

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 highly (84), so it would be advantageous for them to receive it.
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (97), but they also have high valuations for item 2 (65) and item 5 (66).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (97) and item 1 (87).
   - Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (99) but also has high values for item 5 (67).

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Try to allocate high-value items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and overall satisfaction.

4. **Proposed Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 7
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 5
   - Agent 2: Items 1, 3
   - Agent 3: Items 4, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items with high personal value and attempts to balance the distribution as fairly as possible.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives two items, and we have allocated all 8 items.
