Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  88  86  56  24  64  79  86
1  46  60  57  26  28   1  59  96
2  81  94  72  37   6  63  47  23
3  74  47  72  52  68  83  26  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that ensures envy-freeness and efficiency as much as possible. One such method is the "maximin" approach, which aims to maximize the minimum value that any agent receives. This involves balancing the allocations so that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's start by considering the total valuation each agent has for all items and try to balance the allocations accordingly. Here's the valuation table for reference:

| Agent | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | Total |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-------|
| 0     | 60 | 88 | 86 | 56 | 24 | 64 | 79 | 86 | 543   |
| 1     | 46 | 60 | 57 | 26 | 28 | 1  | 59 | 96 | 373   |
| 2     | 81 | 94 | 72 | 37 | 6  | 63 | 47 | 23 | 423   |
| 3     | 74 | 47 | 72 | 52 | 68 | 83 | 26 | 86 | 508   |

Based on this, we'll try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while minimizing potential envy. 

Here's one potential fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 values items 1 and 2 highly, allocate items 1 and 2 to them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 7 the most, so allocate item 7 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values items 0 and 5 highly, so allocate these items to them.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values items 3 and 5 highly, but to avoid conflicts, we allocate items 3, 4, and 6 to them.

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's highest preferences while ensuring each gets a fair share.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

Please note that this allocation may not be perfectly envy-free or optimal in every possible sense, but it attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the given valuations.
