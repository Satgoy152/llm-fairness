Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  70  33  89  20  68  68  88
1  62  52  28  74  35  50  84   9
2  96  62  41  63  57  51  27  14
3  75  14  21  21  90  10  76   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should try to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy and considers each agent's valuations of the items. One common approach to achieving a fair division is to use the Envy-Free criterion, where no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations, we will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly while keeping the distribution fair.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 3 (valuations 78 and 89, respectively).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 6 (valuation 84).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (valuation 96) but since that is assigned to Agent 0, we give Agent 2 items 2 and 5 (valuations 41 and 51, respectively).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (valuation 90).

After assigning these high-value items, we need to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's finalize the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 3]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 6]
- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 2]
- **Agent 3**: Items [4, 7]

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
