Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  34  23  66  94   4  92  78
1  28  31  29  26  72   4  29  99
2  76  38  36  51  17  80  51  80
3  97  22  24  48  18   0  30  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [97 22 24 48 18  0 30 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a challenging problem, but we can attempt to find a reasonable solution by considering the valuations and assigning items in a way that maximizes the total perceived value for each agent.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (94), Item 6 (92)
   - Assign items 4 and 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (99), Item 4 (72)
   - Item 4 is already taken, so assign item 7.
   - Next highest available: Item 1 (31)
   - Assign items 7 and 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (80), Item 7 (80)
   - Item 7 is already taken, so assign item 5.
   - Next highest available: Item 0 (76)
   - Assign items 5 and 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (97), Item 3 (48)
   - Item 0 is taken, so assign item 3.
   - Next highest available: Item 2 (24)
   - Assign items 3 and 2 to agent 3.

### Final Allocations:

After reviewing and adjusting for the constraints of integer allocation and ensuring all items are allocated, the final distribution is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they highly value, while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.
