Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99   0  34  32  97   6  19  78
1  78   7  81  81  41  49  96  18
2  68  70  66  80  42   9  71  30
3   8  85  64  86  12   6  98  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [78  7 81 81 41 49 96 18]

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to ensure that the allocation is fair, potentially envy-free, and everyone receives an integer number of items.

First, let's examine the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 99 + 0 + 34 + 32 + 97 + 6 + 19 + 78 = 365
- Agent 1: 78 + 7 + 81 + 81 + 41 + 49 + 96 + 18 = 451
- Agent 2: 68 + 70 + 66 + 80 + 42 + 9 + 71 + 30 = 436
- Agent 3: 8 + 85 + 64 + 86 + 12 + 6 + 98 + 90 = 449

Next, consider the allocation strategy such as the "round-robin" or "maximum valuation first" that can help in achieving fairness and potentially envy-freeness. We'll use the "maximum valuation first" approach here.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (99).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (85).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (81).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (86).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (97).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (49).
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (98).
8. **Item 7**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (90).

Now, let's write down the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 1, 3, 6, 7

Finally, present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each item while ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents.
