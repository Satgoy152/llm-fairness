Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  30  44  67   9  54  98  47
1  85  89  73  65  75  53  91  54
2  37  25  12  71  93  14  97   4
3  18  85  81  32  43  42  68  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items if we want to ensure equal distribution without any agent receiving fewer or more than their fair share of items.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 87 + 30 + 44 + 67 + 9 + 54 + 98 + 47 = 436
   - Agent 1: 85 + 89 + 73 + 65 + 75 + 53 + 91 + 54 = 585
   - Agent 2: 37 + 25 + 12 + 71 + 93 + 14 + 97 + 4 = 353
   - Agent 3: 18 + 85 + 81 + 32 + 43 + 42 + 68 + 13 = 382

2. **Rank Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: [6, 0, 3, 7, 5, 2, 1, 4]
   - Agent 1: [1, 6, 2, 0, 4, 3, 7, 5]
   - Agent 2: [6, 4, 3, 0, 5, 1, 2, 7]
   - Agent 3: [1, 2, 6, 4, 5, 3, 0, 7]

3. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Distribute the highest valued items according to agent preference and ensure each agent receives 2 items.

Based on these rankings, let's attempt a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Allocate items [6, 0] because these are the highest-valued items for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Allocate items [1, 2] as these are the top choices left for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Allocate items [4, 3] since these are the next available high-valued items for Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Allocate items [5, 7] as these are the best remaining options for Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 items, and the distribution is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation method attempts to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives their most valued items as much as possible given the constraints of integer allocation and the available items.
