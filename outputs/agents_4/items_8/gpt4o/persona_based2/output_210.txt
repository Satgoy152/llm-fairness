Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  61   3  13  84  86  77   7
1  12  42  48  58   8  77  14  41
2  38  40  50  16  73  76  66  26
3  79  13  68   3   0  69  51  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given the agents' valuations for the items, we can approach this problem by maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives, often referred to as the "maximin share."

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items and then proceed with an allocation strategy:

**Total Valuations:**
- Agent 0: 92 + 61 + 3 + 13 + 84 + 86 + 77 + 7 = 423
- Agent 1: 12 + 42 + 48 + 58 + 8 + 77 + 14 + 41 = 300
- Agent 2: 38 + 40 + 50 + 16 + 73 + 76 + 66 + 26 = 385
- Agent 3: 79 + 13 + 68 + 3 + 0 + 69 + 51 + 22 = 305

The task is to allocate 8 items among 4 agents, ideally giving each one 2 items. Let's proceed with an allocation that considers maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

**Allocation:**
- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (92), Item 5 (86)
  - Total Value: 178
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (58), Item 4 (8)
  - Total Value: 66
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (50), Item 6 (66)
  - Total Value: 116
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (13), Item 7 (22)
  - Total Value: 35

This allocation attempts to balance the individual satisfaction of each agent given their specific valuations of the items. Note that this may not be perfectly envy-free due to the discrete nature of the allocation problem, but it optimizes the distribution of high-value items according to each agent's valuation.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that exactly 8 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a fair share based on the given valuations.
