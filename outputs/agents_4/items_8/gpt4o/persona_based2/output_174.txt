Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  13  65  60  64  14  97  75
1  27  39  95   1  68  63  13  77
2  32  22  93  83  19  63  36  97
3  87  28  55  82  87  47  53  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we should aim for an allocation that considers the agents' valuations and attempts to minimize envy. Given that there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items to ensure an equal distribution in terms of quantity. However, the challenge lies in ensuring that the allocation is also fair based on the agents' valuations.

Here is one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate total valuations**: Determine the total valuation each agent has for all items.

2. **Prioritize high-value items**: Allocate items starting with those having the highest individual valuations.

3. **Adjust for envy-freeness**: Ensure the allocation minimizes envy by adjusting when necessary.

Let's walk through the allocation process:

- **Agent 0**: Prioritize items where Agent 0 has high valuations. Items 6 (value 97) and 7 (value 75) are highly valued by Agent 0.

- **Agent 1**: Prioritize items where Agent 1 has high valuations. Item 2 (value 95) is highly valued by Agent 1. Item 7 (value 77) is also a high valuation, but it is already allocated. So, Agent 1 receives item 4 (value 68), the next highest.

- **Agent 2**: Prioritize items where Agent 2 has high valuations. Item 7 (value 97) is taken, so Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 83) and item 5 (value 63).

- **Agent 3**: Prioritize items where Agent 3 has high valuations. Items 0 (value 87) and 4 (value 87) are highly valued, but item 4 is already allocated. Assign item 1 (value 28), which is the next highest available.

The proposed allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

Each agent receives 2 items, and the allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while distributing items fairly.
