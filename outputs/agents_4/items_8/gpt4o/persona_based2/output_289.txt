Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  78  58  24  66  43  11  44
1  88  70  31  80  31  12   1  29
2  58  19  25  73  25  66  84  27
3  58  40  44  64  99  80  37  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) method, which aims to maximize the product of the valuations for each agent's bundle. This method is known to yield envy-free allocations in many cases.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [17, 78, 58, 24, 66, 43, 11, 44]
- Agent 1: [88, 70, 31, 80, 31, 12, 1, 29]
- Agent 2: [58, 19, 25, 73, 25, 66, 84, 27]
- Agent 3: [58, 40, 44, 64, 99, 80, 37, 72]

We need to allocate all 8 items, and each agent can receive an integer number of items. The goal is to allocate the items to maximize the product of the agents' valuations for their bundles.

After analyzing the valuations, one possible allocation that aims to maximize fairness and minimize envy is:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2] (valuations: 78, 58)
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3] (valuations: 88, 80)
- Agent 2: Items [6, 5] (valuations: 84, 66)
- Agent 3: Items [4, 7] (valuations: 99, 72)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives:

- Agent 0: 78 + 58 = 136
- Agent 1: 88 + 80 = 168
- Agent 2: 84 + 66 = 150
- Agent 3: 99 + 72 = 171

This allocation is designed to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints and aims to maximize the Nash Welfare.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
