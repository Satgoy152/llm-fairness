Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  49  19  65  17   1  42  50
1   0  32  93  90  97  37  62  19
2   9  62  48  44   5  50   9  66
3  49  98  80  26  31  20  36  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we should try to follow principles such as envy-freeness and efficiency. However, it's important to note that achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible, especially with discrete items and varying valuations. I'll try to find a relatively balanced allocation that takes into account the agents' preferences based on the given valuations.

Let's review the valuations of each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [71, 49, 19, 65, 17, 1, 42, 50]
- Agent 1: [0, 32, 93, 90, 97, 37, 62, 19]
- Agent 2: [9, 62, 48, 44, 5, 50, 9, 66]
- Agent 3: [49, 98, 80, 26, 31, 20, 36, 31]

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 2. Prioritize giving these items to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 3** highly values item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively high valuation for item 7. Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
5. Distribute the remaining items (5 and 6) considering their valuations to balance the allocation.

Following the above strategy, here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 2, 3, 4 (highest valuations for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 5, 7 (highest valuation for Agent 2)
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 1, 6 (highest valuations for Agent 3)

Now, let's format this allocation as requested:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation is aimed at being fair by attempting to give each agent items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.
