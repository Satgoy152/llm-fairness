Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  54  75  59  67  19  83  52
1   7  76   1  24  45  41  93  58
2  92  53  82   0  20   5  65  50
3  60  47  36  45  44   1  28  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this problem, we aim to achieve a fair division of items among the agents based on their valuations. A common approach to fair division is to ensure envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Given the valuations, we will distribute the items to maximize the overall satisfaction and attempt to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (83) and item 2 (75). Thus, they should receive these items.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the most (93), but since it is already taken, they highly value item 1 (76) and item 7 (58). We will allocate these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 (92) and item 2 (82) the most. Item 2 is already allocated, so they should receive item 0. They also value item 6 (65), but it's already taken. Therefore, we give them item 4 (20), which is the highest remaining valued item for them.
4. **Agent 3** has no exceptionally high valuations compared to others, but they value item 0 (60) and item 1 (47) the most. Item 0 is already allocated, so they should receive items 3 (45) and 5 (which is the highest remaining value for them at 1).

Now let's compile the allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations, attempting to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints.
