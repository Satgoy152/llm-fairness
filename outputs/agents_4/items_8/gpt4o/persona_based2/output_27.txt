Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  57  65  37  28  89  40   5
1  89  58  14  69   2  28  91  59
2  26  19  50  32  42  46  34  55
3  63  91  55  41   8  53  20  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that seeks to minimize envy among the agents. One such method is the "Round Robin" method where each agent selects their most preferred available item in a round-robin fashion. However, in this scenario, we will need to balance the allocations not only in terms of preferences but also in terms of the number of items each agent receives, given that there are exactly 8 items and 4 agents, meaning ideally each agent should receive 2 items.

Letâ€™s go through the allocation process:

1. **Initialize**: Start with all items unallocated and empty allocations for each agent.
2. **Round 1**: Each agent picks their most valued item from the unallocated items.
3. **Round 2**: Repeat the process considering the remaining items and previous allocations to balance the allocation.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

- **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (value 90). Allocate item 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 6 the most (value 91). Allocate item 6.
- **Agent 2** values item 7 the most (value 55). Allocate item 7.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 the most (value 91). Allocate item 1.

After Round 1:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [7]
- Agent 3: [1]

Remaining items: 2, 3, 4, 5

- **Agent 0** now values item 5 the most (value 89) from the remaining. Allocate item 5.
- **Agent 1** now values item 3 the most (value 69) from the remaining. Allocate item 3.
- **Agent 2** now values item 4 the most (value 42) from the remaining. Allocate item 4.
- **Agent 3** now values item 2 the most (value 55) from the remaining. Allocate item 2.

After Round 2:
- Agent 0: [0, 5]
- Agent 1: [6, 3]
- Agent 2: [7, 4]
- Agent 3: [1, 2]

All items have been allocated and each agent has received 2 items, satisfying the condition for a fair division.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
