Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  89  54  64  12  33  77  38
1   4   0  42  80   4  18  81  70
2  21  45  24   3  79  18   0   1
3  76   1   2  66  86  15   0  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or at least approximate it as closely as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own based on their valuations.

Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. **Evaluate Total Valuations**: Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent to understand their preferences. This helps in determining how much each agent values all items in aggregate.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by allocating the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with around the same number of items.

3. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**: Reallocate items if necessary to reduce envy among agents, focusing on minimizing the difference in the perceived value of allocations.

Let's go through the table and allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most (76).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (89).
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (54).
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most (80).
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most (86).
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most (33).
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most (81).
- **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most (99).

After the initial greedy allocation, we have:
- Agent 0: [1, 2, 5]
- Agent 1: [3, 6]
- Agent 3: [0, 4, 7]

Agent 2 currently has no items. We need to adjust the allocations to ensure each agent has at least some items, while also trying to maintain a fair distribution of value.

Let's adjust the allocations by considering the valuations:
- Move Item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 2 (Agent 2's next best option).
- Move Item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 2 (to balance the count and ensure Agent 2 has more value).

Revised allocations:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [3, 6]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]
- Agent 3: [0, 4, 7]

Now, the allocations are more balanced in terms of item count and attempt to minimize envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 4, 7]
}
```
