Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  79  34  73  69  68  20  50
1  10  22  16  43  14   2  48   0
2  13  94  32  29  89  18  15  73
3  37  80  46  82  89  65  30  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent prefers their own allocation over others. Given the differing valuations of items by agents, we can attempt to distribute items such that each agent gets items they value relatively highly.

Here's one possible approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the highest (94), so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the highest (48), so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 the highest (94), so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 the highest (89), so we allocate item 4 to agent 3.

Next, we distribute the remaining items by considering remaining high valuations:

5. **Agent 2**: Also has a high valuation for item 7 (73), which is relatively high compared to other agents. Allocate item 7 to agent 2.
6. **Agent 3**: Has a second high valuation for item 3 (82), allocate item 3 to agent 3.
7. **Agent 0**: Has a high valuation for item 5 (68), allocate item 5 to agent 0.
8. **Agent 3**: Has a high valuation for item 2 (46), allocate item 2 to agent 3.

This allocation aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by distributing items they value highly.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [4, 3, 2]
}
```
