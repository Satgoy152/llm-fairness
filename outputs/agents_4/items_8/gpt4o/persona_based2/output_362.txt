Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  76   8  56  81  25  61  19
1  51  48  37   7  80  59  26  86
2  93  95  52  45  54  49  48  36
3  21  36  30  58  22  12  27  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both the overall value each agent assigns to the items and try to ensure that each agent feels their allocation is fair. One approach to achieve this is to use an algorithm that focuses on maximizing total utility while ensuring some form of fairness, such as envy-freeness or equitable distribution.

The valuations of the agents for each item are as follows:

- Agent 0: [38, 76, 8, 56, 81, 25, 61, 19]
- Agent 1: [51, 48, 37, 7, 80, 59, 26, 86]
- Agent 2: [93, 95, 52, 45, 54, 49, 48, 36]
- Agent 3: [21, 36, 30, 58, 22, 12, 27, 13]

To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to:
1. Balance the total valuations of the items received by each agent.
2. Try to avoid envy where possible, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Given these goals, here's a possible allocation plan:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 4, so we allocate those items to them.
2. **Agent 1** values item 7 the most, so we allocate item 7 to them. They also value item 5 highly, so we allocate that as well.
3. **Agent 2** places the highest value on items 0 and 2, so we assign those items to them.
4. **Agent 3** has the least total valuation across all items, so we give them items with relatively lower valuations by other agents, such as items 3 and 6.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives while considering their preferences and attempting to minimize envy.
