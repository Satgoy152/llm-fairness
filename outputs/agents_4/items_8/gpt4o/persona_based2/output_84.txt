Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  90  45  22  60  81  47  75
1  67  36  63   8  56  88   9   1
2  63  70  72  72  67   8  38  86
3  39   8  50  37  12  43  74   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use an algorithm like the "round-robin" method. This method allows agents to take turns picking the items they value the most until all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Determine the Order of Picking:**
   - Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
   - The agent with the highest total value picks first, and so on.

2. **Round-Robin Picking:**
   - Each agent picks their most valued item that hasn't been allocated yet, following the order determined in step 1.

3. **Continue the Process:**
   - Repeat the picking process until all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(76 + 90 + 45 + 22 + 60 + 81 + 47 + 75 = 496\)
- Agent 1: \(67 + 36 + 63 + 8 + 56 + 88 + 9 + 1 = 328\)
- Agent 2: \(63 + 70 + 72 + 72 + 67 + 8 + 38 + 86 = 476\)
- Agent 3: \(39 + 8 + 50 + 37 + 12 + 43 + 74 + 1 = 264\)

The picking order based on total valuation will be: Agent 0, Agent 2, Agent 1, Agent 3.

4. **Allocation Process:**

- **Round 1:**
  - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 90).
  - Agent 2 picks item 7 (value 86).
  - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 88).
  - Agent 3 picks item 6 (value 74).

- **Round 2:**
  - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 76).
  - Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 72).
  - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 56).
  - Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 37).

After 2 rounds, all items have been allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to be fair by allowing each agent to choose their most valued items according to the predetermined order.
