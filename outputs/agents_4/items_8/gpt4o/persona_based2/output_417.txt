Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51   1  40  98  43  31  45  93
1   2  28  25  61  81  13  88  28
2  42  83  62  31   3  16  18  35
3  93  36  70   3  93  83  21  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We will employ the method of calculating the maximum sum of values each agent can achieve by being allocated a certain subset of items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **List all items and their values for each agent.**
2. **Allocate items to agents in a way that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while maintaining envy-freeness.**

Let's begin by examining the values more closely:

- **Agent 0 Valuations**: [51, 1, 40, 98, 43, 31, 45, 93]
- **Agent 1 Valuations**: [2, 28, 25, 61, 81, 13, 88, 28]
- **Agent 2 Valuations**: [42, 83, 62, 31, 3, 16, 18, 35]
- **Agent 3 Valuations**: [93, 36, 70, 3, 93, 83, 21, 93]

3. **Initial Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by allocating items with the highest valuation for each agent, as this minimizes envy.
   - Ensure that no item is allocated more than once.

Let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 3 (98) and 7 (93).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 6 (88) and 4 (81).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 1 (83) and 2 (62).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value items are 0 (93) and 5 (83).

4. **Verify Allocation**:
   - All agents should have at least one item. 
   - Each item should be allocated exactly once.

5. **Final Allocation**:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation takes into account the highest valuations by each agent for the items, distributing them in a manner that attempts to achieve fairness. Each agent receives items that maximize their total value given the constraints, and all items are allocated.
