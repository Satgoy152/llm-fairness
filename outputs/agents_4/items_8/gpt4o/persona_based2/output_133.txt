Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  19  28  95  53  55  49  22
1  49  62  79  17  74  95  62  47
2  31  57  74  45  13  90  27  79
3  61  80  41  36  70  53  72   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we can aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. We will follow a method that attempts to distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring an equitable distribution of items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 98 + 19 + 28 + 95 + 53 + 55 + 49 + 22 = 419
   - Agent 1: 49 + 62 + 79 + 17 + 74 + 95 + 62 + 47 = 485
   - Agent 2: 31 + 57 + 74 + 45 + 13 + 90 + 27 + 79 = 416
   - Agent 3: 61 + 80 + 41 + 36 + 70 + 53 + 72 + 1 = 414

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Valuation:**
   - We will consider giving each agent one high-value item and then distribute the remaining items to achieve a fair balance.

3. **Allocating the Items:**
   - Start by allocating the item with the highest value for each agent.
   - For Agent 0, item 0 (value 98) is the highest.
   - For Agent 1, item 5 (value 95) is the highest.
   - For Agent 2, item 5 is already taken; item 2 (value 74) is next highest.
   - For Agent 3, item 1 (value 80) is the highest.

4. **Distributing Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate remaining items to balance total valuations and ensure each agent has an integer amount of items.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3 (valuations: 98, 95)
- Agent 1: Items 5, 4, 7 (valuations: 95, 74, 47)
- Agent 2: Items 2 (valuation: 74)
- Agent 3: Items 1, 6 (valuations: 80, 72)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives items they highly value. 

Here is the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 4, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items, maximizes their total valuation, and all items are allocated.
