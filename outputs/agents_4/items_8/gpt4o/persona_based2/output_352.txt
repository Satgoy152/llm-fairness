Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  40  88   7  71  63  76  85
1  64  49  35   4  60  25  30   9
2  74  60  61  93  12  96  21  97
3  65  94  58   2  40  93  27  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to satisfy the fair division principle known as envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuation matrix, we need to allocate all 8 items to 4 agents. One common method to achieve this is using a round-robin approach, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued remaining item until all items are allocated. However, due to the requirement of integer allocations, we'll need to carefully select items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while maintaining fairness.

Let's examine each agent's highest-valued items and allocate them in a way that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Sort items by the highest value each agent assigns to them.
2. Allocate items starting from the highest valued item to the agent who values it most, ensuring each agent receives a comparable total value.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values items 2, 7, and 6 highly.
- Agent 1: Values item 0 highly.
- Agent 2: Values items 7, 5, and 3 highly.
- Agent 3: Values items 1 and 5 highly.

Proceeding with the allocation:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, item 7 to Agent 2, item 1 to Agent 3, and item 0 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 3, item 3 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it highly), item 4 to Agent 0, and item 6 to Agent 0 to balance their total value.

With these considerations, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, minimizing envy between agents, given the constraints of integer allocations.
