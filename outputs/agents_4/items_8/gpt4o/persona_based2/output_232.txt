Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  17  71  71   5  48  53  63
1  54  49  68   4  77  90   5  67
2  56  13  43  61   0  81  68  40
3  10  77   9  80  55  48  31  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, which helps achieve an envy-free allocation. This involves ensuring that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation compared to others.

Let's first analyze the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Agent 0: 77 + 17 + 71 + 71 + 5 + 48 + 53 + 63 = 405
- Agent 1: 54 + 49 + 68 + 4 + 77 + 90 + 5 + 67 = 414
- Agent 2: 56 + 13 + 43 + 61 + 0 + 81 + 68 + 40 = 362
- Agent 3: 10 + 77 + 9 + 80 + 55 + 48 + 31 + 20 = 330

We aim to allocate the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and to minimize envy.

One potential allocation strategy is to assign the items based on each agent's preference, while trying to balance the total value across agents. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0, 2, and 6.
- Agent 1: Assign items 5 and 4.
- Agent 2: Assign items 7 and 3.
- Agent 3: Assign items 1.

The allocations are as follows in terms of each agent's valuation:

- Agent 0: 77 (item 0) + 71 (item 2) + 53 (item 6) = 201
- Agent 1: 90 (item 5) + 77 (item 4) = 167
- Agent 2: 40 (item 7) + 61 (item 3) = 101
- Agent 3: 77 (item 1) = 77

With this allocation, we achieve a more balanced distribution among the agents given their valuations. Now we present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint of allocating exactly 8 items and aims for fairness based on the agents' valuations.
