Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  78  21  54  40  35  47  85
1  35  29  91  51   5  82  79   8
2  34  94  32  98  90  47  53  99
3  38  15  89  81  82  78  12  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we first consider each agent's valuation for the items. A common approach is to use the "maximin share" or to apply a round-robin allocation procedure. However, given the small number of items and agents, we can manually balance the allocation so that each agent receives items that maximize their personal valuation while keeping allocations relatively balanced.

Here's the step-by-step process for one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 7 (99). We allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (91). We allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (81). We allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** values item 7 highly, but it's already taken. Instead, we allocate item 1 (78) to Agent 0 as it's their next best valuation.

Next, we look for additional allocations to balance the total number of items:

5. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (90). We allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 1** values item 5 (82). We allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly, but it's already taken. Instead, we allocate item 6 (78) to Agent 3.
8. **Agent 0** values item 0 next (28). We allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Reassessing the distribution, each agent should have approximately the same number of items. We have allocated 2 items to each agent, which results in the following fair division:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide each agent with items they value highly, while keeping the distribution of items balanced.
