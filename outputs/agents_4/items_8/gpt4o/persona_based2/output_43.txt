Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  95  64  20  48  63  90  61
1   4  57  98  55  67  24  75  33
2  77  35  12  84  88  87  79   3
3  48  96  85  24  83   9  33  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should not prefer the bundle of items received by any other agent over their own bundle based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, one approach is to start by assigning the item with the highest individual value to each agent, and then distribute the remaining items in a way that attempts to balance the total valuations for all agents.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Assignments**: 
   - Assign each agent one of the items they value the most.

2. **Remaining Distribution**: 
   - Distribute the remaining items by considering both the total value each agent has and the values they assign to remaining items.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 (95).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 (98).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 4 (88).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 1 (96), but since it's already taken, we assign item 2 (85).

Now we distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation:

- Assign item 0 (77) to Agent 2 since it has the highest value for them, and they currently have only one item.
- Assign item 3 (84) to Agent 2 since they value it highly, making their total valuation competitive.
- Assign item 5 (63) to Agent 0 to boost their valuation.
- Assign item 6 (75) to Agent 1 to balance their total valuation.
- Assign item 7 (62) to Agent 3 to balance their valuation.

This allocation considers maximizing the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 4],
    "3": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and considers their preferences for items.
