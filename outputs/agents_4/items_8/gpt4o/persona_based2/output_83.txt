Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  89  93  11  25  47  63   9
1  59  83  33  60  50  98  96  15
2  60  98  83  47  84  98  51  97
3  62   2  64  47  17  84  36  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel that they have received a fair share relative to their valuations. We'll use a method that attempts to balance the allocations based on the given valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [56, 89, 93, 11, 25, 47, 63, 9]
Agent 1: [59, 83, 33, 60, 50, 98, 96, 15]
Agent 2: [60, 98, 83, 47, 84, 98, 51, 97]
Agent 3: [62, 2, 64, 47, 17, 84, 36, 79]
```

We'll use a sequential allocation method, choosing the highest valued item available for each agent in turn, in a round-robin fashion. This helps to reduce envy and ensures each agent gets items they highly value.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 93).
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 98).
   - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 98).
   - Agent 3 picks item 7 (value 79).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 89) - already taken, picks next highest available: item 6 (value 63).
   - Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 96) - already taken, picks next highest available: item 3 (value 60).
   - Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 60).
   - Agent 3 picks item 5 (value 84) - already taken, picks next highest available: item 2 (value 64).

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 56) - already taken, picks next highest available: item 4 (value 25).
   - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 50) - already taken, picks next highest available: item 7 (value 15) - already taken, no more items left for this round.
   - Agent 2 has no more items.
   - Agent 3 has no more items.

Now, we have allocated all 8 items. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [7]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuations of each agent for the items they received, aiming to minimize envy among agents.
