Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  86  47  62  90  53  16  13
1   9   3  33  52  83  11  90  17
2  35  23  18  43  67  54  73  87
3  12   4   0  12  63  48  35  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We'll use a strategy that attempts to balance the total perceived value for each agent, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** Sum up the valuations for each agent to understand their total perceived value.
2. **Prioritize High-Value Items:** Allocate items that have high values for specific agents who value them the most, to maximize individual satisfaction.
3. **Ensure Balance:** Try to ensure that the total value received by each agent, according to their own valuations, is as balanced as possible.
4. **Iterative Allocation:** Repeatedly assign items to agents to balance total value, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's compute this:

- **Agent 0:** Total Valuation = 47 + 86 + 47 + 62 + 90 + 53 + 16 + 13 = 414
- **Agent 1:** Total Valuation = 9 + 3 + 33 + 52 + 83 + 11 + 90 + 17 = 298
- **Agent 2:** Total Valuation = 35 + 23 + 18 + 43 + 67 + 54 + 73 + 87 = 400
- **Agent 3:** Total Valuation = 12 + 4 + 0 + 12 + 63 + 48 + 35 + 13 = 187

Based on these valuations, we'll proceed with an allocation attempt that respects these valuations as much as possible.

**Allocation Proposal:**

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (second-highest valuation).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (third-highest valuation).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (fourth-highest valuation).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (remaining item with decent valuation for Agent 0).

This allocation aims to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their own valuations.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent while respecting their highest preferences.
