Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  55  97  52  79  10  22  19
1   6  62  43  31  18  47  33  40
2  38  71  69  97  77  27  53  74
3  11   1  84  98  24  12  48  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents and achieve envy-freeness, we aim to maximize each agent's total utility from the items they receive while ensuring that no agent envies another agent's allocation. This involves considering each agent's valuation of each item. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we strive for an allocation that minimizes potential envy as much as possible.

Let's analyze each agent's preferences and attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (97) and also values item 4 (79) highly. Allocating item 2 and item 4 to Agent 0 gives them a total value of 176.

2. **Agent 1** values item 1 (62) and item 5 (47) the most. Allocating these items to Agent 1 gives them a total value of 109.

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for item 3 (97) and item 7 (74). Allocating these items to Agent 2 provides them with a total value of 171.

4. **Agent 3** values item 3 (98) the most, but since it is already allocated to Agent 2, we look for the next best option. Agent 3 can be allocated item 6 (48) and item 0 (11) for a total value of 59.

Let's ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 5
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 7
- Agent 3: Items 0 and 6

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation for each agent while respecting their preferences as much as possible.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
