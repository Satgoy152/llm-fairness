Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  68   6  75  83  70  87  40
1  39  53  56  86  99  68  34  95
2  85  60  95  47  84  13  24  94
3  28  51  97  95  98  56  16  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. Given that there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. This ensures that the allocations are balanced and fair.

Let's proceed with a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Initial Considerations**:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (87), followed by item 4 (83).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (99), followed by item 3 (86).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (95), followed by item 0 (85).
   - Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (98), followed by item 3 (95).

2. **Assigning Initial Allocations**:
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0 and not highly valued by others).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1 and also highly valued by Agent 3).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2 and second highest for Agent 3).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (second highest for Agent 3 and also highly valued by Agent 1).

3. **Filling Remaining Allocations**:
   - Agent 0 still needs one more item. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest after item 4).
   - Agent 1 needs one more item. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (highest remaining value for Agent 1).
   - Agent 2 needs one more item. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2).
   - Agent 3 needs one more item. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (highest remaining value for Agent 3).

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items and respects their preferences as much as possible, reducing envy.

Let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
