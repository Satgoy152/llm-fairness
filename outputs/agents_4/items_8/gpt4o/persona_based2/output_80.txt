Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  33  67  12  39  38  73  74
1  88  57   7  73   9  26  37  80
2  86  72  10  81  26  22   9  16
3   7  26  90   4   3  99  40   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to consider the valuations provided and attempt to achieve envy-freeness, if possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Let's examine the valuations and attempt to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 7.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most.

Based on these observations, we can start assigning items to agents, trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign **Agent 0** items they value highly: 0, 2, and 6.
- Assign **Agent 1** item 7, which they value the highest.
- Assign **Agent 2** item 3, which they value the highest.
- Assign **Agent 3** item 5, which they value the highest.
  
Now, let's see what's left and try to balance the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** has items 0, 2, and 6. (Total valuation: 93 + 67 + 73 = 233)
- **Agent 1** has item 7. (Total valuation: 80)
- **Agent 2** has item 3. (Total valuation: 81)
- **Agent 3** has item 5. (Total valuation: 99)

### Remaining Items:
- Items 1 and 4 are left.

Let's distribute the remaining items to minimize envy:

- Assign **Agent 1** item 1. (New total valuation: 80 + 57 = 137)
- Assign **Agent 2** item 4. (New total valuation: 81 + 26 = 107)

Final allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 7, 1
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 4
- **Agent 3**: Item 5

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent has a reasonable set of items based on their preferences and minimization of envy.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation respects the requirement of assigning all 8 items and attempts to distribute them in a way that considers the agents' valuations.
