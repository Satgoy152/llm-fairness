Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44   4  95   5  39  99  81  92
1  43  85  91  83   3  57  88  37
2  23   1   2  66  88  71  84  81
3  74   2  15  92  15  14  40  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will aim to minimize envy by considering the valuations of each agent for each item. We'll try to allocate items such that each agent receives the items they value the most, while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly eight.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** For each agent, identify the items that they value the most.

2. **Assign Items:** Start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

3. **Ensure Complete Allocation:** Adjust the allocations to ensure that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

4. **Check for Envy-Freeness:** The goal is to make sure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's proceed with these steps:

**Agent 0:**
- Highest value items: Item 5 (99), Item 2 (95), Item 7 (92)

**Agent 1:**
- Highest value items: Item 2 (91), Item 1 (85), Item 3 (83)

**Agent 2:**
- Highest value items: Item 4 (88), Item 6 (84), Item 7 (81)

**Agent 3:**
- Highest value items: Item 7 (93), Item 3 (92), Item 0 (74)

Based on these valuations, allocate items while avoiding conflicts:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
5. Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 values it most and it is still available).
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
7. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (since it's one of the highest remaining for Agent 3 and is still available).
8. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it highly and it's available).

Now we check if this allocation is fair and satisfies the condition that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 has item 5.
- Agent 1 has items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 has items 4 and 6.
- Agent 3 has items 0, 3, and 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and respects the constraints. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 3, 7]
}
```
