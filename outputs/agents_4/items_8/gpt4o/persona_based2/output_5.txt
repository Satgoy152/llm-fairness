Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  16  82  64  18  71   8  87
1  79  61  85  42   8  58  22   0
2  45  55  21  93  76  16  72  33
3  79  19  19   8  67  62  38  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we should aim to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy among agents, ideally allocating items to maximize each agent's perceived value.

Let's analyze the given valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  16  82  64  18  71   8  87
1  79  61  85  42   8  58  22   0
2  45  55  21  93  76  16  72  33
3  79  19  19   8  67  62  38  12
```

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 7 (87) and 2 (82).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 2 (85) and 0 (79).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 3 (93) and 4 (76).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 0 (79) and 4 (67).

By looking at the preferences, we can start by assigning the highest valued items to one agent and ensure no agent feels envious of anotherâ€™s allocation.

A possible fair allocation might be:
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0, as it is their highest value.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their highest value.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as it is their highest value.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3, since it's also valued highly by Agent 1 but doesn't conflict in this distribution.

Now let's allocate the remaining items:
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it is their next highest value.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it is their next highest value and less valuable for others.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as it is their next highest value and not valued highly by others.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their next highest value.

This allocation respects each agent's highest preference and tries to balance envy.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
