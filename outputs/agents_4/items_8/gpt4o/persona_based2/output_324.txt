Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  10  95  13  62  12   9  64
1  58  63  33  87  68  77  66  17
2   8  94  11  45  41  49  49  59
3  61  49   0  43  22  60  29  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while maintaining envy-freeness as much as possible. A common approach in fair division problems is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each person receives. Here's a possible allocation of the items that considers the valuations provided:

1. **Identify each agent's highest-valued items:**

   - Agent 0's highest-valued item: Item 2 (95)
   - Agent 1's highest-valued item: Item 3 (87)
   - Agent 2's highest-valued item: Item 1 (94)
   - Agent 3's highest-valued item: Item 0 (61)

2. **Allocate these highest-valued items to each respective agent to maximize initial satisfaction:**

   - Agent 0: Item 2
   - Agent 1: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Item 1
   - Agent 3: Item 0

3. **Allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations and ensuring each agent gets two items:**

   - Remaining items: 4, 5, 6, 7

4. **Allocate the remaining items to each agent based on their next highest preferences:**

   - Agent 0: Item 7 (64)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (77)
   - Agent 2: Item 6 (49)
   - Agent 3: Item 4 (22)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and each receives one of their highest-valued items. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
