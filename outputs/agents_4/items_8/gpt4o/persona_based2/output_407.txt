Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  93  36  56  62  31  98  86
1  56  84  57  21  57  27  22   6
2  98   9  22  24  15  28   8   5
3  17  33  51  29  84  73  24  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. The goal of envy-freeness is to ensure that no agent prefers another agent’s allocation over their own.

Given this setup, let's proceed with a manual approach to find an allocation:

1. **Identify the most valued items** for each agent and try to allocate them in a way that maximizes each agent’s satisfaction while maintaining fairness.

2. **Allocate items** by considering each agent's preferences and ensuring that the total number of items allocated sums up to 8.

3. **Iterate through possible allocations** to find an envy-free solution or the closest possible given the constraints.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Since Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 6, we can allocate these to them. This gives them a high utility, as these are some of their most valued items.
- **Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 1 and item 2 significantly, so assigning these items to them could make them satisfied.
- **Agent 2:** Agent 2 highly values item 0 and 2, but as these are already taken, the next highly valued item for Agent 2 is item 5. We can allocate item 5 to them.
- **Agent 3:** Agent 3 highly values item 4, item 5, and item 7. As items 5 is already taken, we can allocate item 4 and item 7 to them.

Now, let's finalize the allocation ensuring that each item is allocated to one agent and all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [4, 5, 7]

By doing this, each agent receives at least one item they value, and the allocation respects everyone's preferences to a reasonable extent while distributing all 8 items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 5, 7]
}
```
