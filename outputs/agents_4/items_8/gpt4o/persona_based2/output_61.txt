Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  76  95  59  36  57  10   7
1  91  77   4  21  63  16  21  95
2   8  70  89  88  56  12  74  81
3  53   5  18  52  74  37  87  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to use the method of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, a concept closely related to envy-freeness. However, achieving complete envy-freeness with indivisible goods is often impossible, so we aim for a solution that minimizes envy.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent should receive 2 items since there are 8 items and 4 agents.
   - We'll try to maximize the minimum value each agent receives.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by allocating the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most.
   - Consider the possibility of reallocating to improve fairness if needed.

3. **Detailed Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (99), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the most (95), so assign item 7 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (89), so assign item 2 to agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 6 the most (87), so assign item 6 to agent 3.

4. **Secondary Allocation:**
   - For the remaining items, consider secondary preferences:
     - Agent 0's next highest valuation is item 2 (95), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 1 (76), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
     - Agent 1's next highest valuation is item 1 (77), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 4 (63), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
     - Agent 2's next highest valuation is item 3 (88), so assign item 3 to agent 2.
     - Agent 3's next highest valuation is item 4 (74), but it's taken. The next highest is item 5 (37), so assign item 5 to agent 3.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Check to ensure all items are allocated without repetition.

Based on this strategy, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [6, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations, aiming to minimize envy while ensuring all items are distributed.
