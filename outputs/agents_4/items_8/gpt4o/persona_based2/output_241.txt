Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  68  93   7  78  93  10  54
1  70  42  95  39  70  35  78  46
2  70  13   1  50  85  19  42  76
3  43   6  11  73  60  82  17   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. One practical approach to achieving a fair allocation is the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item.

Let's perform the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0 picks their most valued item:**
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 93). Agent 0 picks item 2.

2. **Agent 1 picks their most valued item:**
   - Item 2 is already taken. The highest remaining value for Agent 1 is item 0 (value 70). Agent 1 picks item 0.

3. **Agent 2 picks their most valued item:**
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 4 (value 85). Agent 2 picks item 4.

4. **Agent 3 picks their most valued item:**
   - The highest value for Agent 3 is item 5 (value 82). Agent 3 picks item 5.

5. **Agent 0 picks their next most valued item:**
   - The highest remaining value for Agent 0 is item 5 (93), but it's taken. The next highest is item 1 (value 68). Agent 0 picks item 1.

6. **Agent 1 picks their next most valued item:**
   - The highest remaining value for Agent 1 is item 6 (value 78). Agent 1 picks item 6.

7. **Agent 2 picks their next most valued item:**
   - The highest remaining value for Agent 2 is item 7 (value 76). Agent 2 picks item 7.

8. **Agent 3 picks their next most valued item:**
   - The highest remaining value for Agent 3 is item 3 (value 73). Agent 3 picks item 3.

The allocation process is now complete, and each agent has been assigned 2 items. Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```

Each agent receives two items, ensuring that all items are allocated, and the process considers each agent's valuations to minimize envy.
