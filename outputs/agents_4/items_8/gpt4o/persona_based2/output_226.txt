Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  12  36  89  79  83  81  16
1  65  12  87   1  75  59  92  47
2  49  55  13  57  30  48  54  39
3   0  20  69  86  30  49  38  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure each agent is reasonably satisfied with their allocation compared to others. Here is one approach using the maximum marginal utility method, which attempts to allocate items based on maximizing satisfaction for each agent with every allocation step.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**:  
   Each agent has a list of values for each item. We'll allocate items iteratively to maximize the minimum satisfaction for agents.

2. **Iterative Allocation**:  
   In each step, allocate the item that provides the highest marginal utility (value increase) to the agent with the least satisfaction so far.

3. **Final Allocation**:  
   Ensure every item is allocated, and each agent's allocation is as fair as possible under these rules.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: The highest value item is 3 (value 89).
- **Agent 1**: The highest value item is 6 (value 92).
- **Agent 2**: The highest value item is 3 (value 57), but it's already allocated. Next, item 1 (value 55).
- **Agent 3**: The highest value item is 3 (value 86), but it's already allocated. Next, item 2 (value 69).

After allocating the highest value item to each agent initially, we continue allocating the remaining items:

- **Remaining items**: 0, 4, 5, 7.

Allocate remaining items based on maximizing total satisfaction for agents who gain the most value from each:

- **Item 0**: Highest remaining value for Agent 1 (value 65).
- **Item 4**: Highest remaining value for Agent 0 (value 79).
- **Item 5**: Highest remaining value for Agent 0 (value 83).
- **Item 7**: Highest remaining value for Agent 3 (value 65).

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation is an attempt to fairly distribute items based on the agents' preferences while considering the constraints of integer assignments and total item allocation.
