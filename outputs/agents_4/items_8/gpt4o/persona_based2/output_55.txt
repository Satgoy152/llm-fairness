Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  69  20  98  59  39  26  91
1  13  72  11  97  98  61  11   8
2  50  29  26  73  39  34  93  75
3  20   9  51  71  55  25  47  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness among the four agents, we can use algorithms based on concepts like maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring each agent receives a bundle that they value at least as much as the others. For simplicity, let's strive for a simple allocation that balances the items among the agents while considering their preferences.

One way to approach this is to sequentially allocate the items to the agents based on their preferences and valuations, trying to ensure that each agent receives at least one item they value highly. Let's consider each agent's highest-valued items and allocate them accordingly.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 3 (98), 7 (91), and 0 (81).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 4 (98), 3 (97), and 1 (72).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 6 (93), 7 (75), and 3 (73).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 3 (71), 7 (73), and 2 (51).

Here's a proposed allocation:
- Start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent if it's not already taken.
- Sequentially allocate remaining items ensuring each agent gets at least one of their top preferences.

Proposed allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 3 (98)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 (98)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 6 (93)
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 7 (73)

Remaining items to allocate: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 3
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their top-valued items, and all items are distributed.

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [7, 2]
}
```
