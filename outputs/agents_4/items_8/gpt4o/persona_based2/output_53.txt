Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  98  70  35  56  24  13  72
1  61  43  18  64  55  58  16  47
2  51  66  85  62  22  69  41  52
3  33  80  33  86  27  64  74  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents in a way that respects the principles of fair division, particularly aiming for envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

We have the following valuations:

```
Agent 0: [21, 98, 70, 35, 56, 24, 13, 72]
Agent 1: [61, 43, 18, 64, 55, 58, 16, 47]
Agent 2: [51, 66, 85, 62, 22, 69, 41, 52]
Agent 3: [33, 80, 33, 86, 27, 64, 74, 19]
```

First, let's attempt to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while attempting to maintain envy-freeness:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued item for agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 98.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued item for agent 1 is item 0 with a value of 61.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued item for agent 2 is item 2 with a value of 85.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued item for agent 3 is item 3 with a value of 86.

Now, we'll proceed to allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** has item 1. The next highest available valuation is item 7 (value 72).
- **Agent 1** has item 0. The next highest available valuation is item 3 (value 64), but it's taken by Agent 3. So, agent 1 takes item 5 (value 58).
- **Agent 2** has item 2. The next highest available valuation is item 5 (value 69), but it's taken by Agent 1. So, agent 2 takes item 6 (value 41).
- **Agent 3** has item 3. The next highest available valuation is item 5 (value 64), but it's taken by Agent 1. So, agent 3 takes item 4 (value 27).

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 7] with values [98, 72]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 5] with values [61, 58]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 6] with values [85, 41]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4] with values [86, 27]

Each agent receives 2 items, and the allocation is envy-free as each agent receives items with high valuations according to their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
