Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  85  60   3  16  53  24  75
1  24  49  39  14  72  72  87  54
2  89   5  97  79  42  61  50  44
3  10  27  83  35  59  70  89  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use an approach that seeks to minimize envy and maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items. One such method is the Envy-Free (up to one item) allocation, where we ensure that no agent prefers another agentâ€™s allocation over their own, except possibly by the value of one item.

Let's break down the valuation matrix and aim to distribute the items in a fair manner:

```
Valuation Matrix:
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
Agent
0     59  85  60   3  16  53  24  75
1     24  49  39  14  72  72  87  54
2     89   5  97  79  42  61  50  44
3     10  27  83  35  59  70  89  84
```

A possible fair allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest valued items to agents who value them most, provided this does not significantly increase envy among other agents.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item to avoid leaving any agent completely empty-handed, if possible.
3. Aim for the total valuation of items for each agent to be as balanced as possible.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

Agent 0 (values):
- Highest valued items: 1 (85), 7 (75), 2 (60)

Agent 1 (values):
- Highest valued items: 6 (87), 4 (72), 5 (72)

Agent 2 (values):
- Highest valued items: 2 (97), 0 (89), 3 (79)

Agent 3 (values):
- Highest valued items: 6 (89), 7 (84), 5 (70)

Considering these observations, we can attempt to distribute items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 7
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and it attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them items they highly value.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
