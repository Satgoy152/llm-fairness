Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  81   5  85  16  24  38  59
1  35  17  29  54  98  68  10  15
2  96  86  50  97  76  22  48  19
3  77   3  20  93  40  99  33  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. To achieve this, we will follow the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should value their bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Let's examine the valuations and attempt to distribute the items:

**Agent 0's Valuations:**
- Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
- Values: [86, 81, 5, 85, 16, 24, 38, 59]

**Agent 1's Valuations:**
- Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
- Values: [35, 17, 29, 54, 98, 68, 10, 15]

**Agent 2's Valuations:**
- Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
- Values: [96, 86, 50, 97, 76, 22, 48, 19]

**Agent 3's Valuations:**
- Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
- Values: [77, 3, 20, 93, 40, 99, 33, 36]

### Proposed Allocation

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: 0, 3
   - Total value: 86 + 85 = 171

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items: 4, 5
   - Total value: 98 + 68 = 166

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items: 1, 2
   - Total value: 86 + 50 = 136

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items: 6, 7
   - Total value: 33 + 36 = 69

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly. Let's now present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a set of items that collectively have a high value according to their individual preferences.
