Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  68  93  10  68  35  72  90
1  37  37  69  57  31  94  33  80
2  57   5  38  90  93   4   9  75
3  14  18  73  61  85  62  70   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for envy-freeness and to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction while preventing envy.

Let's start by examining the highest valuations for each agent and assigning items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction and minimizing potential envy:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (93) and a decent valuation for item 7 (90). We will assign these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 (94) and a good valuation for item 7 (80). Since item 7 is already allocated, we will assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (93) and item 3 (90) next. We will assign these items to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most (85), but since it is taken, we will assign item 6 (70), item 3 (61), and item 1 (18).

After this initial allocation, let's ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [2, 7]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [4, 3]
- Agent 3: [6, 0, 1]

Finally, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [6, 0, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to satisfy each agent's preferences while ensuring that each gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
