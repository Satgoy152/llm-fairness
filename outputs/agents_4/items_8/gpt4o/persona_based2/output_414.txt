Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  38  90  78   5  79   6  79
1  98  29  78  46  89  81  32   4
2  36   3  77  30  67  83  35  55
3  65  87  72  43  28  53  18   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering the valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations.

To start, let's determine an allocation that attempts to balance the total valuation for each agent as equally as possible. The total sum of valuations for all items is:

- Agent 0: 410
- Agent 1: 457
- Agent 2: 386
- Agent 3: 367

Considering these valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items in such a way that each agent receives a bundle of items with approximately equal total value according to their own preferences. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued items for Agent 0 are 2 (90), 5 (79), and 7 (79).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued items for Agent 1 are 0 (98), 4 (89), and 5 (81).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued items for Agent 2 are 5 (83), 4 (67), and 2 (77).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued items for Agent 3 are 1 (87), 0 (65), and 2 (72).

A potential allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 7 (total value = 169)
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 4 (total value = 187)
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 6 (total value = 118)
- **Agent 3**: Items 1, 3 (total value = 130)

This allocation tries to balance the total valuations each agent receives, while ensuring that no agent envies another since each gets their relatively higher-valued items. Let's express this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to respect the agents' preferences as closely as possible.
