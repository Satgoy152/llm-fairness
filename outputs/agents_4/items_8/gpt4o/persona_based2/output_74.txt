Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  31  94  80  46  13  39  30
1  48  97   4  26  28  40  70  93
2  96  28  22  32  19  25   2  26
3  28  80  26  40  35  37  94  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I'll use the method of "envy-free" allocation, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One approach to achieve this is through the "Maximum Nash Welfare" method, which seeks to maximize the product of the utilities of the agents.

Let's first observe the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (94), followed by item 3 (80).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (97), followed by item 7 (93).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (96), followed by item 3 (32).
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most (94), followed by item 1 (80).

Considering these valuations, we will allocate items by maximizing the utility for each agent while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 2** is assigned item 0, as it is of highest value to them.
2. **Agent 1** is assigned item 1, as it is of highest value to them.
3. **Agent 0** is assigned item 2, as it is of highest value to them.
4. **Agent 3** is assigned item 6, as it is of highest value to them.

Next, we need to allocate the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0** is assigned item 3, as it is of second-highest value to them.
6. **Agent 3** is assigned item 4, as they have a somewhat higher valuation for it compared to other agents.
7. **Agent 1** is assigned item 7, as it is of second-highest value to them.
8. **Agent 2** is assigned item 5, as it balances the allocation and is relatively higher in value for them.

This allocation balances the distribution of items and aims to reduce envy among agents.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, maximizing the overall utility while attempting to maintain envy-freeness.
