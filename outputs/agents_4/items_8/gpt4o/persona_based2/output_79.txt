Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  67  27  56  84  67   3   8
1  29  13  46  14  67  52  78  56
2  70  20  71  70  36  98  84  16
3  84  91  91  96  95   2  63  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to take into account the valuations provided by each agent. One common approach is to use an algorithm that aims to minimize envy, such as the envy-free item allocation algorithm. However, in this scenario, since there are 8 items and 4 agents, we can try to allocate 2 items per agent.

Here's how we can achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 4 and item 1, which are valued at 84 and 67, respectively.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 6 and item 4, which are valued at 78 and 67, respectively. However, item 4 is more highly valued by Agent 0, so we look at the next highest available, which is item 7 valued at 56.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 5 and item 2, which are valued at 98 and 71, respectively.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 3 and item 0, which are valued at 96 and 84, respectively.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly compared to the other agents, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent two items, and all 8 items have been allocated, ensuring a fair distribution based on the provided valuations.
