Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  43  87   4  94  32  83   5
1  50  17  45  60   6  59  12   9
2   2  96  29  49  10  53  83  67
3  49  53  14   3  39  79  12  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 17 45 60  6 59 12  9]
 [ 2 96 29 49 10 53 83 67]
 [49 53 14  3 39 79 12 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Each agent should feel that they received a fair share according to their preferences.

The valuation matrix is:
```
Agent\Item |  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
--------------------------------------
    0      | 83 43 87  4 94 32 83  5
    1      | 50 17 45 60  6 59 12  9
    2      |  2 96 29 49 10 53 83 67
    3      | 49 53 14  3 39 79 12 37
```

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, 4, and 6. We can allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 3. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most, and also values item 5 and 7 highly. We can allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for items 5 and 1, but since these are already allocated to Agent 2, we can allocate items 2 and 7 to Agent 3.

These allocations are made to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, while also keeping the total number of items allocated to 8.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest possible valuations for each agent while distributing the items fairly.
