Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  11  47  39  62  42  92  35
1  55  31  33  98   9  49  92  84
2  71  57  34  28  22  49  48  23
3  36  50  70  99  38  24  88  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or as close as possible allocation. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Here, we will try to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations for each item.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 has a strong preference for items 0, 6, and 4.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly and also has a good preference for items 6 and 7.
- Agent 2 doesn't have extremely high valuations, with item 0 being the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most, followed by item 2 and item 6.

Considering these preferences, we'll attempt to allocate items to balance the perceived value each agent receives:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, since it's their highest-valued item, and they don't have extremely high values for other items.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item, and Agent 3 also highly values it.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 3, as it's their second-highest value and doesn't conflict with previously assigned items.
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it's a high-value item for them.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 3, balancing out the allocation for Agent 3 with items that have moderate value.
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it is also valued moderately by them and helps balance their total value.
7. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 to balance the allocation for Agent 1, which they value moderately.
8. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 to complete their allocation, ensuring each agent has two items.

This allocation should provide a fair balance based on individual valuations. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```
