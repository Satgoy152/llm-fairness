Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  84  24  52  76  82  69  90
1  32  63  18  76  32  73  56  45
2  84  53  61  45  74  41  82  60
3  67  21  90  50  58  77  80  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation based on their valuations.

Given the valuations table, we will use a greedy approach to allocate items to agents in a way that attempts to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 7. To maximize the satisfaction and minimize potential envy, we allocate item 7 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 3. We allocate item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0, so we will allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the most, so it will be allocated to agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items considering the agents' valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 7. Next highest is item 5 (82), so allocate item 5.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 3. Next highest is item 5, but it's taken. So, allocate item 6 (56).
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 0. Next highest is item 6, but it's taken. So, allocate item 4 (74).
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 2. Next highest is item 6, but it's taken. So, allocate item 4, but it's taken. Allocate item 1 (21).

Now, all items are allocated, and the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent items they value highly while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
