Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  75  85  97  94  51  15  53
1  38  87  94  37  23  62  41  41
2  42  10  26  30  33  10   4  34
3  32  84  49  27  99  35  22  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness (or as close as possible given the constraints), we can consider the following steps:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items. This helps in understanding how valuable the entire set is to each agent.

2. **Identify High-Value Items**: For each agent, identify items that have high relative value compared to other agents' valuations.

3. **Initial Allocation Using Maximum Value**: Start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, attempting to ensure each agent receives a fair share of their total perceived value.

4. **Adjust for Fairness**: Swap items if necessary to balance the distribution so that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged compared to another.

5. **Final Allocation**: Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s a proposed allocation based on the valuations:

1. **Calculating Total Values**:
   - Agent 0: 83 + 75 + 85 + 97 + 94 + 51 + 15 + 53 = 553
   - Agent 1: 38 + 87 + 94 + 37 + 23 + 62 + 41 + 41 = 423
   - Agent 2: 42 + 10 + 26 + 30 + 33 + 10 + 4 + 34 = 189
   - Agent 3: 32 + 84 + 49 + 27 + 99 + 35 + 22 + 52 = 400

2. **Initial High-Value Item Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Items 3 (97), 4 (94)
   - Agent 1: Items 2 (94), 1 (87)
   - Agent 2: Items 5 (10), 6 (4)
   - Agent 3: Items 4 (99), 7 (52)

3. **Adjustments for Fairness and Balance**:
   - Swap item 4 from Agent 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highly and Agent 3 has other high-value items.
   - Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item.

4. **Final Allocation**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of high-value items according to each agent's preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
