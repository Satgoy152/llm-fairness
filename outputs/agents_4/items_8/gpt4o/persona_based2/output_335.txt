Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  79  62  26  42  24  44  84
1   5  37  53  19  63  38  52  97
2  92  88  90  87  63  47  61  15
3  51   3   1  51  47  18  15  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a manner that is fair, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we need to determine how to distribute the 8 items among the 4 agents so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations matrix:

```
Agent 0: [14, 79, 62, 26, 42, 24, 44, 84]
Agent 1: [5, 37, 53, 19, 63, 38, 52, 97]
Agent 2: [92, 88, 90, 87, 63, 47, 61, 15]
Agent 3: [51, 3, 1, 51, 47, 18, 15, 35]
```

First, let's consider the highest valued items for each agent and try to assign them such that no agent envies another:

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most at 92, so we assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** values item 7 the most at 84, so we assign item 7 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** values item 7 the most at 97, but since it's already assigned, we assign the next highest value item, which is item 4 (63) to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most at 51, but since it is already assigned, we assign the next highest value item, which is item 3 (51) to Agent 3.

Next, we continue assigning remaining items based on the next highest available valuations, ensuring no agent envies another:

5. **Agent 2** values item 2 the second most at 90, so we assign item 2 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 0** values item 1 the second most at 79, so we assign item 1 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1** has several options, but item 6 is valued at 52, so we assign item 6 to Agent 1.
8. **Agent 3** values item 3 the most at 51, but since it is already assigned, we assign item 5 to Agent 3 as it has the next highest valuation at 18.

Finally, verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 5]

This allocation respects each agent's preferences as closely as possible under the constraint of integer allocations.

Final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
