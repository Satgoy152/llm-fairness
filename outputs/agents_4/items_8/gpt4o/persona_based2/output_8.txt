Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  64  49  38  74  62  60  71
1  94  30  32  11  92  87  71  57
2   9  50  53  49  50  74  45  18
3  53  69  73  88  63  16  27  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a manner that minimizes envy. This involves considering each agent's valuation for the items, trying to distribute the items so that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is as fair as possible relative to others. Here's one possible solution to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 0 and also has relatively high valuations for item 1. We initially allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 4. They also value item 5 highly. We allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has relatively high valuations for items 2 and 6 compared to other agents. We allocate these items to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 3 and also has a high valuation for item 7. We allocate these items to Agent 3.

Now, letâ€™s present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while allocating all 8 items. Each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value, minimizing potential envy.
