Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  50  81  39  93  76   6  90
1  25  27  33  49  64  33  44  62
2  87  10  20  89  96  68  86  86
3  87  58  46  67  74  54  80  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or minimizing the maximum envy. Given the valuations of the agents for each item, a good starting point is to allocate items based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that the total number of allocated items equals the number of items available.

Here's a step-by-step approach for the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   Assess the total valuation each agent has for all items. This could help identify which agent values the items most.

2. **Sort Items by Highest Valuation:**
   For each item, determine the agent who values it the highest and try to allocate the item to that agent if it does not significantly increase envy.

3. **Initial Allocation:**
   Allocate one item at a time to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item if possible.

4. **Redistribute for Fairness:**
   Once the initial allocation is done, check for significant imbalances or envy, and make adjustments where necessary to minimize the maximum envy.

5. **Ensure Complete Allocation:**
   Verify that all items are allocated and that each agent has as close to an equal number of items as possible.

Following this method, the allocations could be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [1, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives items they value highly, while maintaining an even distribution of the total items. Note that adjustments may be made depending on specific envy calculations and the strategic goals of the division.
