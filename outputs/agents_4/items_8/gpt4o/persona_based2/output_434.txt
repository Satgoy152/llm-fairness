Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  69  32  58  22  40   8  62
1  27  92  87  74  83  94   6  90
2  42  12  93  27  12  66  72  23
3  53  94  45  61  29  59  19   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 69 32 58 22 40  8 62]
 [27 92 87 74 83 94  6 90]
 [42 12 93 27 12 66 72 23]
 [53 94 45 61 29 59 19  4]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the four agents while considering their valuations, we aim to find an allocation that minimizes envy, ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value.

### Valuation Matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  69  32  58  22  40   8  62
1  27  92  87  74  83  94   6  90
2  42  12  93  27  12  66  72  23
3  53  94  45  61  29  59  19   4
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Individual Maximization**: Assign each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. **Greedy Assignment**: Once the highest-valued items are assigned, allocate the remaining items based on the next highest preference that isn't yet allocated.
3. **Balance**: Ensure each agent ends up with at least one item, given the total items are more than the number of agents.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is 69 for item 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value is 94 for item 5.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value is 93 for item 2.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value is 94 for item 1, but it's already taken.
   - Next highest is 61 for item 3.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items**: 0, 4, 6, 7
   - Assign based on remaining highest preferences.

6. **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest is item 7 (value 62).
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0.

7. **Agent 1**: 
   - Next highest is item 4 (value 83).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

8. **Agent 2**: 
   - Next highest is item 6 (value 72).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

9. **Agent 3**: 
   - Remaining item is 0 (value 53).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation seeks to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, minimizing envy by assigning each agent at least one of their top choices where possible.
