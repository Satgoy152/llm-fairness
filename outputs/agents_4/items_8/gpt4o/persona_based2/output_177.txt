Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97   2  29  21  11  10  31  70
1  71  52  30  95  58  51  73  29
2  30  14  14  42  16  55  34  20
3  14  46  39  92  23  41  18   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free (as much as possible), we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items. A common approach in fair division problems is to use the maximum sum of individual valuations as a heuristic guide. Here is a step-by-step attempt to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Agent 0 highly values item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1 highly values item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2 has the highest value for item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** Agent 3 highly values item 3, but since it's already assigned to Agent 1, the next highest is item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Now let's distribute the remaining items while considering the overall fairness:

5. **Remaining items:** These are items 2, 4, 6, and 7.

- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this at 29, and Agent 1 values it at 30. To minimize envy, allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it at 58, which is the highest. However, Agent 1 already has item 3 and 2. Agent 0 would be the next best choice since they value it at 11, but we must consider the balance. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 3, who values it at 23.

- **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it at 73, but considering fairness and current allocations, let's allocate item 6 to Agent 0, who values it at 31.

- **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it at 70, but they already have two items. Agent 2 values it at 20, but Agent 3, who currently has fewer items, values it at 8. To balance the number of items roughly equally, allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

After distributing all items, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to take into account both the valuations and the desire to distribute items fairly among the agents.
