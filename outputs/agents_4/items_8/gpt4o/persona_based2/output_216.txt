Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  27  38  15  95  69  50  28
1  61  44  50  55  61  20  64   6
2  22   9  64  15  79  42  49   8
3  34  72   9  89  81  47  42  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as they value any other agent’s bundle. However, achieving exact envy-freeness with integer allocations might not be possible in every case, but we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Let's examine the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high value for item 4 (95).
2. **Agent 1** has relatively balanced valuations but prefers item 2 (50) and item 6 (64).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 (64) highly, which conflicts with Agent 1's preference, but also has a high valuation for item 4 (79).
4. **Agent 3** has a strong preference for item 1 (72) and item 3 (89).

Considering these preferences, let's try to allocate items:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 since they have the highest value for it.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 as they value it highly and it avoids conflict with Agent 2 who can still have item 5.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 as they value it next after item 4.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 as they value it highly.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 as they also value it highly.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 as they value it decently and it doesn't cause conflict.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 as they value it highly.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 as they don’t have strong preferences left.

The allocation would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 0, 6],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the higher valuations of each agent for different items, attempting to minimize envy while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
