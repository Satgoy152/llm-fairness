Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  78  95  98  46  29  71  32
1  60  87  85   1  36  53  28  60
2  45  92  12  49  33  82  28  51
3  71  30   5  58  27  99  65  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 92 12 49 33 82 28 51]
 [71 30  5 58 27 99 65 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness implies that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle. Given that there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent can ideally receive 2 items.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items to each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (98), Item 0 (97)
   - Allocation: Items 3 and 0

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations after Agent 0's allocation: Item 1 (87), Item 2 (85)
   - Allocation: Items 1 and 2

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations after previous allocations: Item 5 (82), Item 7 (51)
   - Allocation: Items 5 and 7

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items left: Item 4 (27), Item 6 (65)
   - Allocation: Items 4 and 6

Now, each agent has received 2 items, and all 8 items have been allocated, meeting the requirement.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
