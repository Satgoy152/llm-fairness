Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  73  72  76  15  31  11  39
1  54  60  11   7  99  62   0  18
2  14  17   0  28  56  73  57  85
3  32  34  35   6  41  85  89  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuation. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in all cases, we will aim to approach it as closely as possible.

To start, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 36 + 73 + 72 + 76 + 15 + 31 + 11 + 39 = 353
- Agent 1: 54 + 60 + 11 + 7 + 99 + 62 + 0 + 18 = 311
- Agent 2: 14 + 17 + 0 + 28 + 56 + 73 + 57 + 85 = 330
- Agent 3: 32 + 34 + 35 + 6 + 41 + 85 + 89 + 34 = 356

Next, we distribute the items one by one, aiming to balance the perceived value each agent receives:

1. **Item 4 (highest value for Agent 1)**: Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 6 (highest value for Agent 3)**: Assign to Agent 3.
3. **Item 7 (highest value for Agent 2)**: Assign to Agent 2.
4. **Item 5 (highest value for Agent 3)**: Assign to Agent 3.
5. **Item 1 (highest value for Agent 0)**: Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 3 (highest value for Agent 0)**: Assign to Agent 0.
7. **Item 0 (highest value for Agent 1)**: Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 2 (highest value for Agent 0)**: Assign to Agent 0.

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 2] → Values: 73, 76, 72 → Total Value = 221
- Agent 1: Items [4, 0] → Values: 99, 54 → Total Value = 153
- Agent 2: Item [7] → Value: 85 → Total Value = 85
- Agent 3: Items [6, 5] → Values: 89, 85 → Total Value = 174

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, given the constraints. The distribution isn't perfectly envy-free due to the inherent complexity of the specific valuations, but it maximizes each agent's satisfaction relative to their own valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 2],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6, 5]
}
```
