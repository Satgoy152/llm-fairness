Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  59  13  18  16  53  19  85
1  16   6  38  47  87  22  11  56
2  77  89  72  95  29  16  17  28
3   2  20  60  17  17  57  68  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we can employ the "round-robin" method. This method iterates over agents and assigns each agent their most valued item that hasn't been allocated yet. This process continues until all items are allocated.

Given the valuations from the table, we can determine each agent's preference for items by sorting their valuations in descending order. Let's proceed with this method:

### Agent Preferences Based on Valuations:
- **Agent 0:** [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4, 2, 0]
- **Agent 1:** [4, 3, 7, 2, 5, 0, 6, 1]
- **Agent 2:** [3, 1, 2, 0, 4, 7, 5, 6]
- **Agent 3:** [6, 5, 2, 1, 7, 3, 4, 0]

### Round-Robin Allocation:
1. **Round 1:**
   - **Agent 0:** Takes item 7
   - **Agent 1:** Takes item 4
   - **Agent 2:** Takes item 3
   - **Agent 3:** Takes item 6

2. **Round 2:**
   - **Agent 0:** Takes item 1
   - **Agent 1:** Takes item 2
   - **Agent 2:** Takes item 0
   - **Agent 3:** Takes item 5

All items have been allocated, with each agent receiving two items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [6, 5]
}
```
