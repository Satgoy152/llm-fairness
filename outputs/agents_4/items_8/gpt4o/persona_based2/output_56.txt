Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  75   6  41  89  86  19  35
1  84  34  19  17  69  91  41  93
2  20  91  14  99  44  25  47  70
3  20  30  95  26   3  40  17  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations provided, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. One approach to achieve envy-freeness is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations, one possible allocation that aims to minimize envy and distribute items fairly could be structured as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 4 and 5. Allocating these two items to Agent 0 could maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values items 0 and 7 highly. Allocating these items to Agent 1 would likely result in a fair distribution.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 3. Assigning these items to Agent 2 could help achieve a fair allocation.

4. **Agent 3**: The remaining items (2 and 6) can be allocated to Agent 3, who values these items reasonably well compared to other available options.

This allocation attempts to balance the values and minimize potential envy among agents by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly relative to others.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
