Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  99  41  59  95  87  69  54
1  40  47  28  18  57   7  67   5
2  95   4  63  71  40  48  48  66
3  59   6  98  57  78  17  23   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Here, we'll aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. Given there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's analyze the valuations and make a suitable allocation:

### Step 1: Allocate High-Value Items
1. Agent 0 highly values items 1 (99) and 4 (95). We'll allocate these to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a relatively high value for item 6 (67). We'll allocate this to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 0 (95). We'll allocate this item to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 2 (98). We'll allocate this item to agent 3.

### Step 2: Allocate Remaining Items
1. Agent 1 can also take item 3 (18), which is the next highest value among remaining items for them.
2. Agent 2 can take item 5 (48) as it has a decent valuation for them.
3. Agent 3 can take item 7 (5), which is the least valued item but allows us to complete the allocation with integer items per agent.
4. Agent 2 can take item 6 (48) as it complements their allocation without causing significant envy.

### Final Allocation
The allocations based on the above steps are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value to each agent given their preferences and ensures that each agent receives 2 items. Each agent receives items that are among the higher-valued ones according to their valuations, aiming to minimize envy.
