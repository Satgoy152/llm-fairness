Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  73  24  58  50  37  52  55
1  70  76  57  70  78   2  20  89
2  27  54  36  96  94  86  49  61
3  64   4   3  18   9  68  65  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a division where each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. This is known as envy-freeness. Given the valuations for each agent and item, let's try to find such an allocation.

First, let's summarize the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 29 + 73 + 24 + 58 + 50 + 37 + 52 + 55 = 378
- Agent 1: 70 + 76 + 57 + 70 + 78 + 2 + 20 + 89 = 462
- Agent 2: 27 + 54 + 36 + 96 + 94 + 86 + 49 + 61 = 503
- Agent 3: 64 + 4 + 3 + 18 + 9 + 68 + 65 + 79 = 310

Next, we will try to allocate the items considering these valuations:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest total valuation, so let's prioritize giving them their highest valued items to avoid envy:
   - Items 1 (76) and 7 (89) are the highest valued items for Agent 1.

2. **Agent 2** has the second highest total valuation:
   - Items 3 (96) and 4 (94) are the highest valued items for Agent 2.

3. **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation:
   - Items 0 (29) and 5 (37) are decent choices for Agent 0 based on remaining items.

4. **Agent 3** has the lowest total valuation:
   - Items 6 (65) and 2 (3) are remaining items that can be given to Agent 3.

Now let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 7]
- Agent 2: [3, 4]
- Agent 3: [6, 2]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to honor the highest preferences of each agent, reducing the potential for envy.

Here is the JSON representing the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```
