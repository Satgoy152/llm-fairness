Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  68  86  18  31  65  81  93
1  44  25  28  68  48  92  61  50
2  61  57  35  16   3  60  46   6
3  95  56  53  94  38  20   6  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we consider the valuations of each agent for the items and aim to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy among agents while ensuring each agent receives whole items. The goal is to allocate all 8 items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 2 has relatively balanced valuations but no extreme preference.
- Agent 3 highly values items 0, 3, and 7.

Given these preferences, a reasonable allocation strategy is to assign items based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a similar total valuation, which helps achieve envy-freeness.

Let's propose an allocation:

- Agent 0: Since Agent 0 highly values items 2, 6, and 7, we assign these to Agent 0 to maximize their satisfaction.
- Agent 1: We assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item. We can also give item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Since Agent 2 does not have any extremely high valuations, we aim for a fair average by giving items 1 and 3.
- Agent 3: We assign items 0 (highest value) and 3 (second highest) to Agent 3.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's total perceived value, thereby minimizing envy and ensuring a fair distribution of items.
