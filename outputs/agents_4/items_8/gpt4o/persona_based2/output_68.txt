Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  88  14  28  81  93  77  26
1  23  94  33  82  78  96  71  57
2  63   0  40  97  23  56  47  86
3   6  71  40  86  53  30  83   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 6 71 40 86 53 30 83  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents with the goal of minimizing envy, we will use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation from their allocated items. The problem can be approached by finding an allocation that attempts to equalize the perceived fairness of the distribution among all agents.

Given the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  88  14  28  81  93  77  26
1  23  94  33  82  78  96  71  57
2  63   0  40  97  23  56  47  86
3   6  71  40  86  53  30  83   2
```

1. We first identify which items have the highest value for each agent, considering both maximizing their own gain and minimizing envy from others.
2. Then, we attempt to allocate items such that each gets a fair share according to their preferences.
3. Finally, an integer number of items must be allocated to each agent, with the total number of allocated items being exactly 8.

Given these considerations, an allocation that attempts to fairly divide the items is as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 5 (93) and item 1 (88) highly.
- Agent 1 highly values item 5 (96) and item 3 (82).
- Agent 2 values item 3 (97) and item 7 (86) highly.
- Agent 3 values item 6 (83) and item 3 (86) highly.

An allocation aiming to balance these preferences might look like:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 7, 2
- Agent 3: Items 6, 0

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [6, 0]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, while each agent gets two items and all items are allocated.
