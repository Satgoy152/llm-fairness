Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  83  40  48  29  85  43  55
1  87  41  26  56  71  85  18  42
2  31  84  47  34   2  47  98  31
3  25  84  79  56  91   0  66  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims for envy-freeness, we must consider how each agent values the items and strive to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be complex, especially with integer constraints and the specific valuations provided, we can attempt to make the allocation as fair as possible.

Let's examine the valuations and find a reasonable allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 5 highly at 85. Also has high valuations for items 1 (83) and 0 (80).
2. **Agent 1:** Values items 0 and 5 at 87 and 85, respectively, and item 4 at 71.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 6 extremely high at 98. Item 1 is also highly valued at 84.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 4 very high at 91 and item 7 at 88.

Given these preferences, a possible allocation strategy could be:

- **Agent 0:** Prioritize item 5 since it's highly valued. Also allocate item 0.
- **Agent 1:** Assign item 4, which is highly valued, and item 3 for balance.
- **Agent 2:** Assign item 6 due to the extremely high valuation, and item 1.
- **Agent 3:** Assign item 7, which is highly valued, and item 2.

This allocation aims to give each agent a high-value item according to their preferences, along with additional items where possible, while keeping the allocations integer-based.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
