Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  71  42  99  67  63  91  87
1  15  68  55  31  93  60  61  73
2  81  46  69  90   5  59  37  70
3  53   1  96   9  54  92  97  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that seeks to maximize each agent's satisfaction or minimize envy. This involves allocating items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's consider allocating items to achieve an envy-free distribution, where each agent receives an approximately equal share based on their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items 0 (79), 6 (91)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items 4 (93), 7 (73)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items 3 (90), 5 (59)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items 2 (96), 1 (1)
  
This allocation aims to ensure that each agent gets items they highly value, minimizing envy.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent is assigned items according to their highest preferences, aiming for a fair division.
