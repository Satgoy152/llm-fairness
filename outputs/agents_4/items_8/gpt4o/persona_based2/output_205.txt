Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  54  50  63   0  46  59   2
1  74  41  67  81  45  72  69  71
2  55  95  31  20  11  66  28  22
3   4  10  76  66  88   5  20  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy as much as possible. An envy-free allocation means that each agent prefers their own bundle of items over any other agent's bundle, according to their valuations.

First, let's analyze the total value each agent attributes to all items combined:

- Agent 0: 26 + 54 + 50 + 63 + 0 + 46 + 59 + 2 = 300
- Agent 1: 74 + 41 + 67 + 81 + 45 + 72 + 69 + 71 = 520
- Agent 2: 55 + 95 + 31 + 20 + 11 + 66 + 28 + 22 = 328
- Agent 3: 4 + 10 + 76 + 66 + 88 + 5 + 20 + 25 = 294

Next, we will try to divide the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, ideally, each agent should get 2 items.

We can use a method that aims to balance the allocations based on the valuations:

1. Agent 1 has the highest total valuation, so we start by allocating items that maximize their valuation:
   - Items 3 (81) and 0 (74) are allocated to Agent 1.

2. Next, we consider Agent 2 as they have the second-highest valuation:
   - Items 1 (95) and 5 (66) are allocated to Agent 2.

3. For Agent 0, we allocate items that maximize their remaining value:
   - Items 6 (59) and 2 (50) are allocated to Agent 0.

4. Lastly, Agent 3 will receive the remaining items:
   - Items 4 (88) and 7 (25) are allocated to Agent 3.

By following this method, we aim to provide each agent with a fair share based on their valuation preferences. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items and aims to minimize envy by giving preference to items that each agent values highly.
