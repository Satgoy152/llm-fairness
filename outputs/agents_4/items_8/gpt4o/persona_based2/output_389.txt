Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  61   5  70  17   4  45  73
1  12  33  80  46  82  88  96  86
2  33  45  29   9  43  44   5  75
3  22  83  50  13  13  72  54  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness where possible. An envy-free allocation means no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

First, let's summarize the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 valuations: 53, 61, 5, 70, 17, 4, 45, 73 (Total: 328)
- Agent 1 valuations: 12, 33, 80, 46, 82, 88, 96, 86 (Total: 523)
- Agent 2 valuations: 33, 45, 29, 9, 43, 44, 5, 75 (Total: 283)
- Agent 3 valuations: 22, 83, 50, 13, 13, 72, 54, 66 (Total: 373)

Next, we allocate items by considering each agent's highest-valued items, ensuring that the allocations are as balanced as possible.

1. **Agent 1** has the highest total valuation, so we start by giving them their highest-valued items:
   - Item 6 (96), Item 5 (88), Item 4 (82)

2. **Agent 3** has the next highest total valuation:
   - Item 1 (83), Item 7 (66)

3. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 3 (70), Item 0 (53)

4. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2 (29)

Now, let's verify that all items have been allocated and adjust if necessary to ensure envy-freeness:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 0]
- **Agent 1**: Items [6, 5, 4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2]
- **Agent 3**: Items [1, 7]

Finally, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [6, 5, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation respects the goal of each agent receiving an integer number of items, with all items distributed, while trying to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
