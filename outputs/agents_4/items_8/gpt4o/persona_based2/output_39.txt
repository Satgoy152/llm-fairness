Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  55  23  95  35  66  27  20
1  95   8  67  91  93  98  34   5
2   1  70  28  81  83  20  59  37
3  66  75  94  82  71  69  52  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if each agent believes they have received at least as much value as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation.

Let's first consider each agent's total valuation of all items:

- Agent 0: 40 + 55 + 23 + 95 + 35 + 66 + 27 + 20 = 361
- Agent 1: 95 + 8 + 67 + 91 + 93 + 98 + 34 + 5 = 491
- Agent 2: 1 + 70 + 28 + 81 + 83 + 20 + 59 + 37 = 379
- Agent 3: 66 + 75 + 94 + 82 + 71 + 69 + 52 + 95 = 604

Now, let's try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's valuation while ensuring no envy:

1. **Agent 3:** Has the highest total valuation. Prioritize high-value items for them.
   - They value item 2 the most: 94
   - Next is item 7: 95 
   - They also value item 3: 82

   Allocating items 2, 7, and 3 to Agent 3.

2. **Agent 1:** Focus on high-value items after Agent 3's preferences.
   - Most valuable remaining item is 5: 98
   - Then item 4: 93
   - And item 0: 95

   Allocating items 5, 4, and 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 0:** Allocate remaining items to maximize their value.
   - Items left are 1 and 6. Agent 0 values item 1: 55 and item 6: 27.

   Allocating items 1 and 6 to Agent 0.

4. **Agent 2:** No items are left for Agent 2 due to maximizing others' valuations based on their high preferences.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance each agent's top preferences and distribute the high-value items according to the agents' valuations.
