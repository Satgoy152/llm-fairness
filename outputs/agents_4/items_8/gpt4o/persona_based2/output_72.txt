Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  31  47  79   7  71  75  93
1  99  29  64  51  53  77  47  95
2  66  12  72  70  39  77   1  19
3  58  43  38   6  95  11  28   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an approximate envy-free distribution where each agent receives a relatively equal share of their perceived value. The goal is to ensure that no agent envies another for their allocation of items. Given the complexity and lack of perfect solutions in many cases, we strive for an optimal fair division under the constraints provided.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Determine Total Valuations**: Calculate each agent's total valuation of all items.
   - Agent 0: \(32 + 31 + 47 + 79 + 7 + 71 + 75 + 93 = 435\)
   - Agent 1: \(99 + 29 + 64 + 51 + 53 + 77 + 47 + 95 = 515\)
   - Agent 2: \(66 + 12 + 72 + 70 + 39 + 77 + 1 + 19 = 356\)
   - Agent 3: \(58 + 43 + 38 + 6 + 95 + 11 + 28 + 8 = 287\)

2. **Calculate Fair Share**: Divide each agent's total valuation by the number of items to understand their fair share.
   - Fair share per item: \(\frac{435 + 515 + 356 + 287}{8} = 199.125\)

3. **Allocate Items**: Allocate items to agents to maximize each one's perceived valuation while maintaining fairness and minimizing envy.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 1** values item 0 very highly (99), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 7 (93) and 3 (79), so allocate these to Agent 0.
- **Agent 2** values item 5 (77) highly, so allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 4 (95) highly, so allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 1** also values item 7 highly (95), but it has already been allocated. Next, allocate item 6 (47) to Agent 1 due to their remaining high valuation.
- **Agent 2** has a relatively high valuation for item 2 (72), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** should receive item 1 as it maximizes their remaining high valuation.
- Finally, allocate item 6 to any agent who has not reached their fair share.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the valuations of each agent, ensuring that they receive items they highly value, thereby minimizing envy and distributing items as fairly as possible.
