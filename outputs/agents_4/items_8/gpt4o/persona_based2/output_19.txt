Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  75  69  41  67  15  69  36
1  86   4  71  89  65  20  49  55
2  22  87  87  84  41  27   7  84
3  80  52  51  34  11  10  64  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. A commonly used method in fair division is the "maximum marginal utility" approach, where at each step, we assign the item to the agent who values it most highly, considering the remaining items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values this item the most at 87, so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 2**: Both Agent 2 and Agent 3 value this item equally at 87. To break the tie, let's allocate it to Agent 2 since they have a slightly lower total valuation than Agent 3.
3. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 89, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this item the most at 67, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 20, so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values this item the most at 64, so allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
7. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values this item the most at 85, so allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
8. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 86, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item and adjust if needed:

- Agent 0 has item 4.
- Agent 1 has items 0, 3, and 5.
- Agent 2 has items 1 and 2.
- Agent 3 has items 6 and 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```
