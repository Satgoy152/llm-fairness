Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  20  45   0  20  31  81  14
1  86  92  91  56   9  13   2  39
2  36  85  97  31  66  54   1  53
3  46  98  67  11  46  51  12   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. In an envy-free allocation, each agent feels that they have received at least as much value as any other agent, according to their own valuation of the items.

To achieve this, we will consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation. There are multiple methods to tackle this problem, but a straightforward approach is to start with the agent who has the highest valuation for an item and allocate that item to them if possible. Then proceed to the next highest valuation, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no item is allocated more than once.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 with 92. We allocate item 1 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2 with 97. We allocate item 2 to agent 2.
3. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 3 with 11. We allocate item 3 to agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 with 81. We allocate item 6 to agent 0.
5. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 with 86. We allocate item 0 to agent 1.
6. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 with 66. We allocate item 4 to agent 2.
7. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 5 with 51. We allocate item 5 to agent 3.
8. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 7 with 14. We allocate item 7 to agent 0.

Now, each agent has been considered, and all items have been allocated. Below is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
