Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  30  33  89  78  98  41   5
1   0  18  83  75  87  87  94  28
2  10  99  80  25  84  92  38  31
3  51  89   2  42  24  65   7  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use various methods such as the round-robin method, adjusted winner procedure, or simply optimizing based on valuations to minimize envy. The goal is to allocate the 8 items so that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total allocation equals 8 items. We must ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible, given the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** For each agent, identify the items with the highest valuation to prioritize in their allocations.

2. **Initial Allocation of High-Value Items:** Allocate at least one high-value item to each agent to ensure they receive something of value.

3. **Balance Remaining Items:** Distribute the remaining items based on minimizing envy and maximizing overall satisfaction.

4. **Check and Adjust Allocations:** Ensure that the total allocation is 8 items and adjust if necessary to maintain fairness.

Let's consider the allocations step by step:

- **Agent 0:** High-value items are 5 (98) and 3 (89).
- **Agent 1:** High-value items are 6 (94) and 4 (87).
- **Agent 2:** High-value items are 1 (99) and 5 (92).
- **Agent 3:** High-value items are 1 (89) and 7 (70).

To ensure fairness, we can distribute the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items [3, 5].
- Agent 1 gets items [6, 4].
- Agent 2 gets items [1, 5].
- Agent 3 gets items [0, 2, 7].

This distribution attempts to balance high-value items among the agents while ensuring each agent is allocated an integer number of items and the total sum of allocations equals 8.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2, 7]
}
```

Note that this allocation ensures each agent receives at least one high-value item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
