Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  52   0  36  86  97  86  70
1   4  25   0  19  53  47  56  93
2  68  15  85  87  27  11   4  41
3  16  59  87  36  58   1  93   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, especially with integer constraints and varying preferences. 

To approach this, we can use a method that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation based on their valuations. We'll attempt to allocate the items such that the overall satisfaction is as high as possible, and we'll ensure that each agent gets a fair share of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [28, 52, 0, 36, 86, 97, 86, 70]
Agent 1: [4, 25, 0, 19, 53, 47, 56, 93]
Agent 2: [68, 15, 85, 87, 27, 11, 4, 41]
Agent 3: [16, 59, 87, 36, 58, 1, 93, 1]
```

A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on descending order of each agent's preferences, ensuring that each agent gets a fair number of items (either 2 or 3) given there are 8 items and 4 agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with the highest valuation for Agent 0. 
   - Items 5 (97), 4 (86)

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with the highest valuation for Agent 1.
   - Items 7 (93), 6 (56)

3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with the highest valuation for Agent 2.
   - Items 3 (87), 2 (85)

4. **Agent 3**: Prioritize items with the highest valuation for Agent 3.
   - Items 0 (28), 1 (59)

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and items are allocated based on their highest preferences, which should minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
