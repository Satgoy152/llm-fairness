Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  63   4  42  76  69  95  14
1  55  72  18  27  90  46   6  10
2  45  82  92  88  90  87  96  60
3  55  86  59  37  20  83  45  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that they received at least as much value as any other agent.

Let's start by evaluating the total valuation each agent has for all items and then proceed to allocate the items in a way that attempts to balance these valuations.

### Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 50 + 63 + 4 + 42 + 76 + 69 + 95 + 14 = 413
- Agent 1: 55 + 72 + 18 + 27 + 90 + 46 + 6 + 10 = 324
- Agent 2: 45 + 82 + 92 + 88 + 90 + 87 + 96 + 60 = 640
- Agent 3: 55 + 86 + 59 + 37 + 20 + 83 + 45 + 87 = 472

### Strategy for Allocation:
- We will distribute items giving priority to the highest individual valuations.
- Each agent should ideally receive items that they value highly, ensuring they do not feel envious of others.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Agent 2** has the highest total valuation and will receive items with high individual values:
   - Item 6 (96), Item 2 (92), Item 5 (87)

2. **Agent 3** has the next highest total valuation:
   - Item 1 (86), Item 7 (87), Item 5 (83) already allocated to Agent 2, so choose next highest not allocated: Item 3 (37)

3. **Agent 0** has a moderate total valuation:
   - Item 4 (76), Item 0 (50) 

4. **Agent 1** has the lowest total valuation:
   - Item 4 (90) already allocated to Agent 0, so choose next highest not allocated: Item 1 (72)

### Final Allocation:
- Ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item.

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5, 6],
    "3": [0, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
