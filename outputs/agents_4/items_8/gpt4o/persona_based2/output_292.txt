Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  57  94  71  95  93   9   2
1  35  79  82  23   9  98  95  11
2  52  42  85  48  15  10  14   6
3  45  50   8  53  22  38  44  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the allocation of any other agent. This can be challenging, but we can aim for a division where the perceived value differences are minimized.

Let's calculate an allocation using a simple round-robin approach based on valuations. We'll go through each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets the same number of items by the end.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Valuations: [7, 35, 52, 45]
   - Highest value: 52 (Agent 2)
   - Assign to Agent 2
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Valuations: [57, 79, 42, 50]
   - Highest value: 79 (Agent 1)
   - Assign to Agent 1
   
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Valuations: [94, 82, 85, 8]
   - Highest value: 94 (Agent 0)
   - Assign to Agent 0
   
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Valuations: [71, 23, 48, 53]
   - Highest value: 71 (Agent 0)
   - Assign to Agent 0
   
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Valuations: [95, 9, 15, 22]
   - Highest value: 95 (Agent 0)
   - Assign to Agent 0
   
6. **Item 5**: 
   - Valuations: [93, 98, 10, 38]
   - Highest value: 98 (Agent 1)
   - Assign to Agent 1
   
7. **Item 6**: 
   - Valuations: [9, 95, 14, 44]
   - Highest value: 95 (Agent 1)
   - Assign to Agent 1
   
8. **Item 7**: 
   - Valuations: [2, 11, 6, 71]
   - Highest value: 71 (Agent 3)
   - Assign to Agent 3

### Final Allocation:
- To ensure each agent receives an equal or almost equal number of items, we need to adjust the allocation. Since Agent 0 has three items, Agent 1 three items, Agent 2 one item, and Agent 3 one item, let's adjust to ensure more even distribution.

### Adjusted Allocation:
- Reassign Item 1 from Agent 1 to Agent 2.
- Reassign Item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 3.

This results in:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 3: Items [5, 7]

### JSON Representation of the Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the items while considering the highest valuations and ensuring each agent receives items.
