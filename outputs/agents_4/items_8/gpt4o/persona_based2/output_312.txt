Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  11  14  62  89  99  29   1
1  90  53  12  51  65  61  31  59
2  46  90  13  20  12  61  60  40
3  94  97  87  73  38  60  27  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll use a heuristic approach to distribute the items based on the valuations provided.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items to get a sense of their overall preferences:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 31 + 11 + 14 + 62 + 89 + 99 + 29 + 1 = 336
- Agent 1's total valuation: 90 + 53 + 12 + 51 + 65 + 61 + 31 + 59 = 422
- Agent 2's total valuation: 46 + 90 + 13 + 20 + 12 + 61 + 60 + 40 = 342
- Agent 3's total valuation: 94 + 97 + 87 + 73 + 38 + 60 + 27 + 93 = 569

Given these total valuations, we know Agent 3 values the items the most, followed by Agent 1, Agent 2, and finally Agent 0. We will attempt a distribution that reflects these valuations while aiming for fairness.

Now, let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 3**: As the agent with the highest total valuation, Agent 3 should get some of the highest-valued items to minimize envy. Assign items 1, 3, and 7 to Agent 3, as these are among the highest valued for them.

2. **Agent 1**: Next, allocate some high-value items to Agent 1. Assign items 0 and 5 to Agent 1, as these have high valuations for them.

3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 to Agent 2, which is valued relatively high by them.

4. **Agent 0**: Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 0. This ensures all agents have at least one item and tries to balance their lesser overall valuation by assigning these specific items.

Finally, let's check the allocations to ensure all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Items 1, 3, 7

This allocation assigns all 8 items among the 4 agents, considering their relative valuations and trying to reduce envy.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
