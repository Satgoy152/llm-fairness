Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  21  76  20  72  79  62  79
1  28  19  81   2  23  27  44  54
2  55  81  70   6  86  75  31  87
3  85   0  72  88  32  35  85  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent values their allocation as much as possible and would not prefer another agent's allocation based on their valuations.

First, let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 9 + 21 + 76 + 20 + 72 + 79 + 62 + 79 = 418
- Agent 1: 28 + 19 + 81 + 2 + 23 + 27 + 44 + 54 = 278
- Agent 2: 55 + 81 + 70 + 6 + 86 + 75 + 31 + 87 = 491
- Agent 3: 85 + 0 + 72 + 88 + 32 + 35 + 85 + 45 = 442

A fair division strategy could be based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring envy-freeness:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 5 and 7.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 1 and 4.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 0, 3, and 6.

Taking these preferences into account, a possible fair allocation is:

- Assign item 5 and 7 to Agent 0: Agent 0 values these items at 79 and 79, respectively.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1: Agent 1 values this item at 81.
- Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 2: Agent 2 values these items at 81 and 86, respectively.
- Assign items 0, 3, and 6 to Agent 3: Agent 3 values these items at 85, 88, and 85 respectively.

This allocation considers each agent's highest-valued items, thereby reducing the likelihood of envy.

The resulting allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0, 3, 6]
}
```
