Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  32  92   3  57  81  81   8
1  21  90  93  64   8  99  12  43
2  95   1  74  91  29   8  90  59
3  56  30  62  65  11  44  75  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that aims for fairness and envy-freeness, we'll use a method that considers the agents' valuations for each item. One common approach is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) solution, which attempts to maximize the product of the agents' utilities (where utility is the sum of valuations of items allocated to an agent). This method can help in achieving an allocation that is both efficient and fair.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **List each agent's preference for items**: This means identifying which items are most valued by each agent.

2. **Assign items iteratively**: Start by assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual utility without causing envy.

3. **Check for envy-freeness**: After assigning items, ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation. This means that no agent should prefer the bundle of another agent over their own.

Using the given valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (92) and item 5 (81), so we will consider these.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (99) and item 2 (93), but cannot have both since agent 0 also highly values them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 (95), item 3 (91), and item 6 (90) highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 (75) and item 3 (65) reasonably.

After considering these high-value items and ensuring that allocations minimize envy:

- **Agent 0** gets item 2 (92) and item 4 (57).
- **Agent 1** gets item 1 (90) and item 5 (99).
- **Agent 2** gets item 0 (95) and item 3 (91).
- **Agent 3** gets item 6 (75) and item 7 (42).

This allocation maximizes the agents' utilities based on their individual valuations and maintains fairness by distributing high-value items among different agents. 

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```
