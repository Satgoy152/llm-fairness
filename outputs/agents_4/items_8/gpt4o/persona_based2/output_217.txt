Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  79  92  94  57  27  52  89
1  15  40  79  13  55  44  26  41
2  16  71  49  94  73  54  88  95
3  43  44  92  40  47  47  30  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents using the concept of envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own. In this case, we have 8 items and 4 agents, so each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuations and try to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 7. We'll aim to allocate two of these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the most, but since Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2, it might be more efficient to allocate different items to Agent 1. Items 1 and 5 have relatively high valuations for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values items 3 and 7 the most, but since Agent 0 also values item 3 highly, we will need to consider other options. Items 4 and 6 are also valued highly by Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has a relatively uniform valuation, but item 2 stands out. However, since Agent 0 values item 2 the most, we will allocate different items to Agent 3. Items 0 and 5 have reasonable valuations.

Let's allocate the items based on this analysis:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 2 and 3 (highest valuations for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1 and 5 (good valuations for Agent 1, and not the highest for others).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 4 and 7 (decent valuations for Agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 0 and 6 (reasonable valuations and not the highest for others).

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on each agent's highest preferences while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 8.
