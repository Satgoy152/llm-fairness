Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  72  63  22  46  44  30  55
1   1  13   4  48  84  63  27  27
2  99  18  99  33  76  89  63  21
3  94  17  99   9  46  84  52  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations given by each agent. One approach to achieving a fair division is to try and maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items that they value highly, while also ensuring that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

Let's analyze the given valuations and devise a strategy to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (72), followed by item 2 (63), and item 7 (55).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (84), followed by item 5 (63).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for items 0 (99) and 2 (99) equally, followed by item 5 (89).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for items 2 (99), and 0 (94), followed by item 5 (84).

Considering these valuations, let's make a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (72) which is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 (84) which is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 0 (99) as it's one of their highest valued items and item 6 (63) which is also highly valued.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 2 (99) as it is the highest valued item for them.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items trying to balance the overall valuation each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (22) and item 7 (55) to fill up their allocation.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (63) to complement their valuation.
- **Agent 3**: They already have item 2 (99), which is quite high, so they don't need more items to balance.

This allocation tries to ensure each agent receives items they highly value and balances the overall distribution of value.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2]
}
```
