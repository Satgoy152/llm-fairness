Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15   3  54  24  31  96  76  47
1  37  38  17  38  93  36  63  51
2  42  30  61  34  25  46  79   7
3  84  74  33  90  23  44  72  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use methods such as the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) or a similar approach that balances efficiency and fairness. Here we aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 the highest (96), followed by item 6 (76). 
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (93), followed by item 1 (38) and item 3 (38).
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the highest (79), followed by item 2 (61).
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest (90), followed by item 0 (84).

We'll allocate items based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 since it has the highest valuation by any agent (96).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valuation (93).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 as it is their highest valuation (79).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 as it is their highest valuation (90).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 has a high valuation for it (54), and it balances the distribution.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since it is their next highest valued item (38).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 because it is their next highest valued item (84).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 to balance the distribution.

After these allocations, all items are distributed, and each agent has a fair allocation based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' preferences, ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly, thereby minimizing envy.
