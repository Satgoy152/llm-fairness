Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  79  76  64  29  94  36  90
1  71  93  53  25  28  23  21  17
2  66  14  17  33  35  79  60  62
3  97  55  47  16  38  10   7  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own, given their valuations. To achieve this, we will use a heuristic approach, considering both the valuations and the number of items each agent can receive.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Highest Value Allocation**:
   - Start by identifying the item of highest value for each agent and try to allocate those to the respective agents.

2. **Balancing the Number of Items**:
   - Each agent must receive at least 2 items since there are 4 agents and 8 items. 

3. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**:
   - Adjust allocations so that no agent envies another's allocation based on their given valuations.

The allocations are as follows:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items [1, 5]: These items provide high value to Agent 0 (79 and 94).

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Items [0, 2]: These provide a high aggregate value to Agent 1 (71 and 53).

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Items [6, 7]: These are among the highest valued for Agent 2 (60 and 62).

- **Agent 3**: 
  - Items [3, 4]: These provide the best possible aggregate value for Agent 3 among the remaining items (16 and 38).

This allocation ensures each agent receives 2 items, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
