Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19   3  60  87  91  25   3  33
1  69  74  12  77  44  71  36  51
2  58  98  87  94   4  68  34   2
3  75  25  22  11  20  61  12  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents while considering envy-freeness, it's important to ensure that each agent values their allocation as much as or more than what any other agent receives. Given the valuations in the table, we can start by trying to allocate items to maximize total satisfaction and minimize potential envy.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Allocate items 0 and 7. 
   - Agent 0 values these items at 19 and 33, respectively, for a total value of 52.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate items 1 and 5.
   - Agent 1 values these items at 74 and 71, respectively, for a total value of 145.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 2 values these items at 87 and 94, respectively, for a total value of 181.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocate items 4 and 6.
   - Agent 3 values these items at 20 and 12, respectively, for a total value of 32.

This allocation attempts to balance the values each agent receives, considering their preferences and trying to minimize envy. It's not always possible to completely eliminate envy, but the goal is to minimize it as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
