Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  55  96  38  47  38  18  72
1  46  44  54  51   5  49  20  52
2  18  34  40  87  85  23  29  72
3  56  24  78  76  18  96  52  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy, we aim to allocate items to agents in a way that balances their valuations as much as possible. We will use a heuristic approach to allocate the items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the available items, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (96)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (54), Item 3 (51), Item 7 (52)
   - Since Item 2 is already allocated, consider next highest available: Item 7 (52)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (87), Item 4 (85)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (96)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, one to each agent. Next, we continue to allocate the remaining items:

5. **Allocate remaining items:** 
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 4, 6

   - **Agent 0:**
     - Next highest available: Item 0 (79)
     - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

   - **Agent 2:**
     - Next highest available: Item 4 (85)
     - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

   - **Agent 3:**
     - Next highest available: Item 6 (52)
     - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3.

   - **Agent 1:**
     - Remaining item: Item 1 (44)
     - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

This ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the fairness by giving each agent items they value highly and ensuring all items are distributed.
