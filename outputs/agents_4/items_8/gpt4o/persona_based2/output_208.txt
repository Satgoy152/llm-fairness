Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  39  52  64  61  56  40  18
1  15  54  43   3  85  44  67  53
2  15  13  69  11  93  38  93  50
3  96  86  22  54  35  46  50  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, I will use the concept of envy-freeness in fair division. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the valuations table, we can attempt to allocate the items such that the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

First, let's review the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  39  52  64  61  56  40  18
1  15  54  43   3  85  44  67  53
2  15  13  69  11  93  38  93  50
3  96  86  22  54  35  46  50  78
```

Next, I'll consider each agent's total value for their most preferred items and aim to distribute the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while maintaining envy-freeness.

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0, so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4, so we assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 4 and 6, but since item 4 is already taken, we assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1, so we assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Now I'll allocate the remaining items while considering the preferences and ensuring each agent has an integer number of items:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since it's one of the highest remaining valued items for them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 since it has a relatively higher value for them compared to others.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 since it's a moderate value for them and not highly valued by others.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 as it has a moderate value for them.

The allocations can be distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This distribution attempts to balance the high-value preferences of each agent and distribute the items fairly, while ensuring that each agent's bundle is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
