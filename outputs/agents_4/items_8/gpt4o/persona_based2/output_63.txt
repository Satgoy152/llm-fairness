Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  72  86  29  63  33  97  13
1  50  44  59  47  91  64  84  48
2  34  91  61  71  99  34   2  31
3  35  65  31  66  19  31  28  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible. One approach to achieve fairness is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations, let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy among the agents:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (97).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (91).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (99), but since it's more beneficial overall for Agent 1, we'll allocate their next highest, item 1 (91).
- Agent 3 values item 7 the highest (94).

Let's allocate these items first to align with the highest valuations for each agent:

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Now, we are left with items 0, 2, 3, and 5 to be allocated and we ensure each agent gets two items:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 2, as it is their next highest valuation (86).
- Agent 1: Allocate item 5, as it is their next highest valuation (64).
- Agent 2: Allocate item 0, as it is their next highest valuation (34).
- Agent 3: Allocate item 3, as it is their next highest valuation (66).

This way, all items are allocated, and each agent receives two items. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and provide a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
