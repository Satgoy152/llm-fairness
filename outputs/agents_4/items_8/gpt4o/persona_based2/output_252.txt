Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  23  29  80  49  76  89  45
1  18   5  20  66   9  50   2  33
2  89  16   1  74  89  45  35  55
3   8  10  35  37  70  94  77  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 8 10 35 37 70 94 77 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations carefully. We want each agent to feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation from their own perspective.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for item 6 (89) and item 3 (80). Assign items 6 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 5 (50) and item 3 (66) relatively high, but item 3 is already taken by Agent 0. Assign item 5 to Agent 1. 
   - Item 7 has a value of 33, which is the next highest for Agent 1 after item 5. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 as well.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values items 0 (89) and 4 (89) equally high. Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 has remaining items 1 and 2. Assign these to Agent 3 as they are not as highly valued by the others.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

These allocations ensure that each agent gets items that maximize their individual valuations, aiming for a sense of fair division based on the given valuations.
