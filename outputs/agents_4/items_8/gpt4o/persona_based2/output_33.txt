Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  83  28  51   6  16  35  31
1  96  72  16  44  78  41  31  41
2  26  92  59  23  33  65  95  59
3  89  20  57  11  52   1  18  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [26 92 59 23 33 65 95 59]
 [89 20 57 11 52  1 18 94]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels that they have received a fair share according to their valuations. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's start by summarizing the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 333 (83 + 83 + 28 + 51 + 6 + 16 + 35 + 31)
- Agent 1: 419 (96 + 72 + 16 + 44 + 78 + 41 + 31 + 41)
- Agent 2: 452 (26 + 92 + 59 + 23 + 33 + 65 + 95 + 59)
- Agent 3: 342 (89 + 20 + 57 + 11 + 52 + 1 + 18 + 94)

Next, we'll try to allocate items in a way that balances these totals and minimizes envy.

Let's go through the items, considering each agent's valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value for Agent 1 (96), second highest for Agent 3 (89). Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value for Agent 2 (92), second highest for Agent 0 (83). Allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value for Agent 3 (57), second highest for Agent 2 (59). Allocate to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value for Agent 0 (51), second highest for Agent 1 (44). Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value for Agent 1 (78), second highest for Agent 3 (52). Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value for Agent 2 (65), second highest for Agent 1 (41). Allocate to Agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value for Agent 2 (95), second highest for Agent 0 (35). Allocate to Agent 2.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value for Agent 3 (94), second highest for Agent 2 (59). Allocate to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 5, 6],
    "3": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to align with the valuations and balances the distribution of items while aiming to minimize envy.
