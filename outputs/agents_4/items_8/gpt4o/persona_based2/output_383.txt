Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  84  31  41  29  12  41  27
1  82  77  77  43  93  64  78  63
2  72  37  50  30  63  32  91  87
3   8  32  73  62  38  19  40  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to use a method that seeks to minimize envy among agents and allocate items such that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, one common approach is to use the Envy-Free up to One Item (EF1) criterion, which ensures that each agent values their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle, possibly except for one item.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  84  31  41  29  12  41  27
1  82  77  77  43  93  64  78  63
2  72  37  50  30  63  32  91  87
3   8  32  73  62  38  19  40  39
```

A potential allocation strategy is as follows:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 0, 1, 2, and 4. Assign these items to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 6 and 7, assign these items to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** can take items 3 and 5, which are not highly valued by other agents, ensuring a fair distribution.

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 6 and 7.
- Agent 3 does not receive any items, since their valuations are generally lower compared to other agents.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the values received by each agent and adheres to the fair division principles, although exact envy-freeness may not be possible with the given constraints and discrete items.
