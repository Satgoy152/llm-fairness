Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  69  11  71   9   8  73  71
1  45  92  18   2   7  50  50  51
2  36  88  53  12  26  55  98  55
3  82   0  90  65  97  56  16  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82  0 90 65 97 56 16 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that the items they receive are at least as good as the items received by any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate in a way that maximizes fairness:

### Valuations Matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  69  11  71   9   8  73  71
1  45  92  18   2   7  50  50  51
2  36  88  53  12  26  55  98  55
3  82   0  90  65  97  56  16  93
```

### Initial Observations:
- Agent 0 highly values item 0 and 6.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 6.
- Agent 3 highly values item 4 and 7.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, since they value it the highest (94).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (92).
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 2, since they value it the highest (98).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as they value it the highest (97).

After allocating the most valued items, we will allocate the remaining items by considering the remaining highest valuations and trying to balance the total value of allocations:

5. Assign item 7 to Agent 3, as they also have a high valuation for this item (93).
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 3, as they have a strong valuation for this item (90).
7. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it (71).
8. Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as they have a reasonable valuation (55).

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [4, 7, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items according to the agents' preferences while ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair share.
