Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  22  56  28  51  90  62  47
1  19  32  84  44  71   5  48  62
2  91  95  10  52  50  65  93  89
3  44  84  55  25  17  66  56  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations to aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels that they have received the best possible set of items according to their own valuations. Given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all 8 items must be allocated, we can proceed by considering a balanced approach that minimizes envy.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (90), Item 6 (62)
   - Allocation: [5, 6]
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (84), Item 4 (71)
   - Allocation: [2, 4]
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (91), Item 1 (95)
   - Allocation: [0, 1]
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Remaining items: Item 3 (25), Item 7 (45)
   - Allocation: [3, 7]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that are among the best available to them given the constraints, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, with attempts to balance their valuations as fairly as possible.
