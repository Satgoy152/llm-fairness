Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  73  68  20   6  79  21  64
1  99  27  52  12  66  54  87  97
2  36  89  31  77  89  39  65  82
3  19  21   4  80  37  30  43  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we look for an allocation that minimizes envy, aiming for an envy-free or approximately envy-free division. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Given the problem, we can use the following heuristic approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items to agents such that each agent receives items that maximize their own valuation while considering other agents' preferences.
3. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Let's go through the process:

### Step 1: Initial Allocation Strategy

- Sort the items based on each agent's valuation in descending order. This helps prioritize high-value items for each agent.
- Allocate items to agents one by one, ensuring that each agent gets an item they value highly.

### Step 2: Iterative Adjustment

- Adjust allocations iteratively to reduce any potential envy. This might involve swapping items between agents if it increases each agent's satisfaction.

### Allocation Plan

Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest valuation items: 5 (79), 1 (73), 7 (64)
- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest valuation items: 0 (99), 7 (97)
- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest valuation items: 1 (89), 4 (89), 7 (82)
- **Agent 3**:
  - Highest valuation items: 3 (80), 7 (84)

Let's allocate based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets some items:

- Agent 0: [5, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]

Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, aiming to minimize envy.
