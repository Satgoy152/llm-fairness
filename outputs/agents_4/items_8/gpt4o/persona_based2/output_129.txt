Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  82  53  16  82  14  65  99
1  40  77   2  63  23  56  54  10
2  25  47  37  75  59  51  79   7
3  14  86  92  69  76  42  47   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to aim for a distribution where each agent feels they have received their fair share according to their valuation. This is a challenging problem, especially with integer constraints, so we will try to minimize envy by maximizing the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's first consider the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0: 59 + 82 + 53 + 16 + 82 + 14 + 65 + 99 = 470
- Agent 1: 40 + 77 + 2 + 63 + 23 + 56 + 54 + 10 = 325
- Agent 2: 25 + 47 + 37 + 75 + 59 + 51 + 79 + 7 = 380
- Agent 3: 14 + 86 + 92 + 69 + 76 + 42 + 47 + 4 = 430

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has a particularly high valuation for items 1 and 4. Allocating these items would give them a total valuation of 82 + 82 = 164.
   
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 highly, so we assign item 3 to them. This gives them a valuation of 63.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 6 and 3, but since item 3 is already allocated, we allocate item 6 to this agent. This gives them a valuation of 79.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 highly, so we assign item 2 to them. We should consider allocating item 4 or 5 as well, but since item 4 is already allocated, we allocate item 5. This gives them a valuation of 92 + 42 = 134.

Continuing this approach while ensuring all items are allocated, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4 (Valuation = 59 + 82 + 82 = 223)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 7 (Valuation = 63 + 10 = 73)
- Agent 2: Items 5, 6 (Valuation = 51 + 79 = 130)
- Agent 3: Items 2 (Valuation = 92)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, and all items are distributed. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2]
}
```
