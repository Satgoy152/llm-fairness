Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  72  34  58  68  30  62  37
1  78  71  11  24  23  39   6  96
2  95  93   7  34  55  31  23  92
3  49  84   2  92   0  67   1  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel that their bundle of items is at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuation.

Let's consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items to achieve a fair allocation:

First, we can calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined:

- Agent 0: 61 + 72 + 34 + 58 + 68 + 30 + 62 + 37 = 422
- Agent 1: 78 + 71 + 11 + 24 + 23 + 39 + 6 + 96 = 348
- Agent 2: 95 + 93 + 7 + 34 + 55 + 31 + 23 + 92 = 430
- Agent 3: 49 + 84 + 2 + 92 + 0 + 67 + 1 + 48 = 343

Now, let's aim to allocate items by ensuring each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their valuation while maintaining a balanced distribution of total value across agents:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly, so we'll assign item 1 to them. They also have a relatively high valuation for item 4 and item 0, so we can assign these items as well.

2. **Agent 1** highly values item 7, so we'll assign it to them. Item 0 is the next highest, but already assigned, so they can take item 5.

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 7 but they are already assigned. We'll give them item 3 and item 6 as they are moderately valued by this agent.

4. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly, but it is already assigned, so we will assign items 2 and 5 to them, which are still available and have relatively higher valuations for them.

After considering the above, we adjust our allocations to ensure all items are assigned and each agent receives a fair share. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives according to their preferences, while ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair share.
