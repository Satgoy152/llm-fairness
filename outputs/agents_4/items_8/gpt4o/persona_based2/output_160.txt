Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  85  66  35  27  29  35  67
1  85   3  93  79  20  66  47  92
2  28  34  76  59  70   9  22  25
3  68  88  43  76  52   0  32  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and aim for envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item and try to distribute them in a way that minimizes any potential envy. This problem is complex and finding a perfect envy-free allocation might not always be possible, but we can strive to approximate it as best as possible.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** 
   - Compute the total valuation each agent has for all items to get a sense of how they value the entire set.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Start by allocating items based on the highest valuation each agent has for a single item, ensuring each agent gets their most valued item if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - After initial allocations, adjust the remaining allocations to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their valuations.

4. **Iterate for Improvement:**
   - Re-evaluate and adjust allocations to minimize envy, ensuring each agent's total value is as balanced as possible given their preferences.

Following this approach, here's a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Gets items [1, 5]
  - Total valuation: 85 (item 1) + 29 (item 5) = 114

- **Agent 1:** Gets items [2, 7]
  - Total valuation: 93 (item 2) + 92 (item 7) = 185

- **Agent 2:** Gets items [4, 6]
  - Total valuation: 70 (item 4) + 22 (item 6) = 92

- **Agent 3:** Gets items [0, 3]
  - Total valuation: 68 (item 0) + 76 (item 3) = 144

This allocation considers each agent's highest-valued items and distributes the remaining items to balance total valuations.

### Final JSON Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
