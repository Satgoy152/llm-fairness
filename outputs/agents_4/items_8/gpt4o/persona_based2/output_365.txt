Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  49  55  40  82  45  52  15
1  41   2  88  91  12  20  78  11
2  58  16  44  18   8  79  11  94
3  85   7  67  37  64   4  22  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we want to ensure that each agent's allocation is perceived as fair based on their valuations. Given the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items, we aim to distribute the items such that the total perceived value by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Letâ€™s analyze the valuations and attempt to create an envy-free allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (69), 4 (82), and 6 (52).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 2 (88), 3 (91), and 6 (78).
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 very highly (94), followed by item 5 (79).
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 0 (85), and item 2 (67).

A potential allocation strategy can be:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 due to their highest valuation.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, since they value it the most.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 for their second-highest value.
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, their highest-valued item.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 2, their second-highest preference.
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 0, their second-highest preference.
7. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 due to their highest preference.
8. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 to balance allocations.

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences and should be perceived as fair based on their valuations of the items. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
