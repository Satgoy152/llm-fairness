Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  54  42  14  96   9  65  83
1  51  22  83  63  53  67  99  14
2  31  58  73  12  21  42  99  36
3  23  88  74  45  58  69  84  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, let's consider the valuations of the agents for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. We'll try to allocate items such that no agent envies another's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - There are 8 items and 4 agents, meaning each agent should ideally get 2 items for an equitable distribution, but we may adjust to ensure fairness.
   - We need to consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate those first, ensuring no agent is significantly worse off.

2. **Allocation Process**:
   - Start by allocating items that are most valuable to each agent, trying to ensure that each feels they have received a fair portion of what they value highly.

3. **Detailed Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (96), and item 0 next (65). Allocate items 4 and 0 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (99), and item 2 next (83). Allocate items 6 and 2 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the highest, which is already taken, so we allocate their next highest, item 2 (73), which is also taken. Allocate item 5 (42) and item 1 (58) to agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the highest, but it's taken. Their next highest is item 5, which is taken. Allocate item 3 (45) and item 7 (43) to agent 3.

4. **Final Check**:
   - Ensure each agent has the allocated number of items and that all 8 items are allocated.

5. **Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Items 4, 0
   - Agent 1: Items 6, 2
   - Agent 2: Items 5, 1
   - Agent 3: Items 3, 7

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of what they value, minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.
