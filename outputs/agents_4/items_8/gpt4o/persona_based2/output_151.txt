Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  27  56  57  87  41  85  81
1  14  25  73  20  98  77   5  95
2  92  86  39  80  36  24  62  10
3  18  72  90  84  16  78  71  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that maximizes the minimum satisfaction of each agent. One approach is to use a round-robin allocation based on the agents' preferences, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that no agent envies another.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [99, 27, 56, 57, 87, 41, 85, 81]
Agent 1: [14, 25, 73, 20, 98, 77, 5, 95]
Agent 2: [92, 86, 39, 80, 36, 24, 62, 10]
Agent 3: [18, 72, 90, 84, 16, 78, 71, 37]
```

We will allocate the items to the agents step-by-step, taking care to distribute the items so that each agent has a fair allocation based on their preferences:

1. **Round 1**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (value: 99, highest for Agent 0).
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (value: 98, highest for Agent 1).
   - Agent 2 gets item 1 (value: 86, highest for Agent 2).
   - Agent 3 gets item 2 (value: 90, highest for Agent 3).

2. **Round 2** (remaining items: 3, 5, 6, 7):
   - Agent 0 gets item 6 (value: 85, second-highest for Agent 0).
   - Agent 1 gets item 7 (value: 95, second-highest for Agent 1).
   - Agent 2 gets item 3 (value: 80, second-highest for Agent 2).
   - Agent 3 gets item 5 (value: 78, second-highest for Agent 3).

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has received two items based on their highest preferences available during each round.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly, taking into account the preferences of each agent as much as possible.
