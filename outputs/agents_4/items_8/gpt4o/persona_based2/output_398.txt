Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  34  78  95  45  92  56  11
1   7  24  95  49  27  55  81  48
2  34  73  22  48  89  25  14  62
3  95   9  36  99  48  46  49  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items that another agent receives over their own bundle.

Let's consider the valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** 40, 34, 78, 95, 45, 92, 56, 11
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** 7, 24, 95, 49, 27, 55, 81, 48
3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** 34, 73, 22, 48, 89, 25, 14, 62
4. **Agent 3's Valuations:** 95, 9, 36, 99, 48, 46, 49, 88

Our goal is to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized for their allocated items, keeping envy to a minimum.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Initial High Value Allocation:**
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (99). Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (92). Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (95). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (89). Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

2. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 3, having received item 3, has a high value for item 7 (88). Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 2 has a high value for item 1 (73). Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 has a high value for item 6 (56). Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has an interest in item 0 (7), but since item 0 has a higher value for Agent 3 (95), allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocation:
The allocation looks as follows, aiming for a balance based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent some of their most valued items while ensuring all 8 items are allocated.
