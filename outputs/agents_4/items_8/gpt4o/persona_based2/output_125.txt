Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  72  94  97  90  90  74  88
1  97  24   0  77  52  31  47  27
2  77  96  65  90  33  41  20   4
3  85  14  26  51  25  42  37  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Given the valuations, we'll try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their own valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [82, 72, 94, 97, 90, 90, 74, 88]
Agent 1: [97, 24,  0, 77, 52, 31, 47, 27]
Agent 2: [77, 96, 65, 90, 33, 41, 20,  4]
Agent 3: [85, 14, 26, 51, 25, 42, 37, 92]
```

First, we can assign the item with the highest value to each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 97.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 97.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 96.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the highest at 92.

Now, let's assign these items first:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 7.

This leaves us with the following unallocated items: [2, 4, 5, 6].

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 would most prefer item 2 next (value 94).
- Agent 1's next best option is item 4 (value 52).
- Agent 2 would prefer item 5 (value 41).
- Agent 3 is left with item 6 (value 37).

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: [3, 2]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [1, 5]
- Agent 3: [7, 6]

Finally, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [7, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives two items.
