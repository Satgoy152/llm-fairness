Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  63  87   5   6  87  49  22
1  15   2  69  37  46  67  62  17
2   9  20  89  15   7  64  64  81
3  64  13  21  19  32  98  42  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and distribute the items in a way that attempts to equalize perceived value across agents. We will use a simple heuristic approach to allocate items to agents, aiming for an envy-free allocation as much as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items, which will help us gauge their overall preferences:

- Agent 0: 90 + 63 + 87 + 5 + 6 + 87 + 49 + 22 = 409
- Agent 1: 15 + 2 + 69 + 37 + 46 + 67 + 62 + 17 = 315
- Agent 2: 9 + 20 + 89 + 15 + 7 + 64 + 64 + 81 = 349
- Agent 3: 64 + 13 + 21 + 19 + 32 + 98 + 42 + 31 = 320

Now let's attempt an allocation. A fair distribution should ideally distribute the total perceived value equally among the agents. The total sum of all valuations is 409 + 315 + 349 + 320 = 1393, so each agent should receive approximately 1393 / 4 = 348.25 in perceived value.

We will allocate items to agents based on maximizing each agent's perceived value while considering the constraints:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 because it has the highest value for them (98), and it is a relatively high value item.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value for them (90), and it's a significant portion of their total value.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 because it has the highest value for them (89).
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 because it's one of their higher value items (62) and helps balance their total valuation.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 as it adds significant value (46).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 to maximize their perceived value (63).
7. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 as it provides a reasonable value (19).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 to balance out their perception (81).

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value among agents while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the total value.
