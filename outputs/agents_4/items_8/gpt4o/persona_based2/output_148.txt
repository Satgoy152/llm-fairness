Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  94  91  95  40  83  91  97
1  73  91   1  72  40  97  32  27
2  81  36  53  36  25  52  34  10
3  80  41  32  81  25  86   3  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We'll try to balance the allocation so that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Understand the Valuations**: We have a table of valuations for 4 agents and 8 items. Each agent has different values for each item.

2. **Agent Preferences**: Identify which items each agent values the most to the least. This helps in ensuring that we try to allocate highly valued items to the respective agents.

3. **Initial Allocation**: Start by giving each agent one of their most valued items, if possible. Then, continue to allocate the remaining items based on decreasing order of preference while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and no agent gets all items they value highly at the expense of others.

4. **Iterate for Fairness**: After initial allocation, iterate to reallocate items if any agent is particularly envious of another's allocation, adjusting until a fair state is achieved.

5. **Final Allocation**: Ensure all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item (where possible), achieving a balanced and fair distribution.

Let's proceed with a proposed allocation based on these principles:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 7 the highest and item 3 highly.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the highest and item 1 highly.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the highest.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 3 and item 5 highly.

Considering these preferences, a fair allocation would aim to give each agent at least one of their highly valued items without causing envy. Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [7, 2]
- **Agent 1**: Items [5]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 4, 6]
- **Agent 3**: Items [1, 3]

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 gets their highest valued item 7 and another high-valued item.
- Agent 1 gets their highest valued item 5.
- Agent 2 gets their highest valued item 0 and a fair share of other items.
- Agent 3 gets item 3 which they value highly, and item 1.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 4, 6],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to be as envy-free as possible given the preferences and constraints.
