Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  94  81  95  27  38  52  96
1  38  33  11  87  47  72  44  63
2  56  93   4  85  32  88  36  68
3  74   0  52   3  25  59  20  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that there is no envy and each agent receives an integer number of items, we can adopt the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which balances efficiency and fairness.

To achieve this, we'll consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to allocate them in a way that maximizes the product of their utilities. This method often results in an envy-free allocation, or at least reduces envy to a minimum.

Here's the process we'll use:

1. Calculate the product of utilities for each possible allocation.
2. Choose the allocation that maximizes this product.

Given the values in the table, let's attempt to allocate the items.

First, we observe the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (96) and item 3 (95) next.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (72) and item 3 (87) next.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (88) and item 1 (93) next.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (74) and item 2 (52) next.

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 7 to agent 0, as it's their highest valued.
2. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as it's their highest valued.
3. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as it's their second-highest valued after item 5, which is already taken.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 3, as it's their highest valued.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 0, it’s their second-highest valued after item 7.
6. Assign item 2 to agent 3, as it's their second-highest valued after item 0.
7. Assign item 4 to agent 2, as it’s another decent valued item for them.
8. Assign item 6 to agent 1, as it’s another decent valued item for them.

Now each agent either has two items or one, and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Items 5, 4
- Agent 3: Items 0, 2

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction and should be reasonably envy-free.
