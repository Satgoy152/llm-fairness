Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  19  34  32  73  50  79  47
1  77  83  36  67  39  89  35  52
2  17  48  19  94  16  36  93  40
3  52  85   1  36  20   8  89  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation. Given the valuations provided, one possible way to achieve this is by maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate items such that we minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations**: Prefers item 6 the most.
2. **Agent 1 Valuations**: Prefers item 5 the most.
3. **Agent 2 Valuations**: Prefers item 3 the most.
4. **Agent 3 Valuations**: Prefers item 1 the most.

Now, let's assign items based on these preferences and check for potential envy:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 6 (highest value for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (highest value for Agent 1).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (highest value for Agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 1 (highest value for Agent 3).

Next, assign the remaining items by looking at secondary preferences and filling in gaps to avoid envy:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (high value, reducing envy from Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest available for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (next highest available).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (remaining item).

After distributing the items, the allocations are:

- **Agent 0**: Items 6, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 5, 0
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 4
- **Agent 3**: Items 1, 7

This distribution aims to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy and maximizing perceived fairness.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
