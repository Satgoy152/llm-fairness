Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  40   8  98  55  93  17  77
1  42  89  44  42  18  39   1  15
2  50  10  17  57  65  95  63  79
3  43  20  32  33   7  89  32  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a manner that strives for envy-freeness, we can use a method inspired by the "Adjusted Winner" procedure, although exact envy-freeness might not always be possible in discrete allocations. The key idea is to allocate items to agents such that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their total valuation, subject to the constraint that all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - There are 4 agents and 8 items, so ideally each agent should get 2 items to maintain a balanced distribution.
   - We should try to distribute items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation more than their own allocation.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - We will start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most. 
   - After each allocation, we will adjust the remaining unallocated items and continue the process.

3. **Step-by-Step Allocation:**

   - **Item 0:** Highest valuation is by agent 0 (98).
   - **Item 1:** Highest valuation is by agent 1 (89).
   - **Item 2:** Highest valuation is by agent 1 (44).
   - **Item 3:** Highest valuation is by agent 0 (98).
   - **Item 4:** Highest valuation is by agent 2 (65).
   - **Item 5:** Highest valuation is by agent 2 (95).
   - **Item 6:** Highest valuation is by agent 2 (63).
   - **Item 7:** Highest valuation is by agent 0 (77).

   After this allocation, let's check if any agent gets more than 2 items and adjust as necessary:

   - Agent 0 is initially allocated items 0, 3, and 7.
   - Agent 1 is allocated items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 2 is allocated items 4, 5, and 6.

   Since Agent 0 and Agent 2 have 3 items each, let's adjust to give each agent 2 items:

   - Reallocate item 7 (valued at 77 by agent 0) to agent 3, who values it at 29, to ensure agent 0 only has 2 items.
   - Reallocate item 6 (valued at 63 by agent 2) to agent 3, who values it at 32, to ensure agent 2 only has 2 items.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 2]
   - Agent 2: Items [4, 5]
   - Agent 3: Items [6, 7]

5. **JSON Representation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items while considering the agents' valuations, but it's important to note that exact envy-freeness might not be achieved due to discrete allocations.
