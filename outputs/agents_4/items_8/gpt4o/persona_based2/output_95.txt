Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  87  62  23  49  86  16  12
1  24  41  39  13  83  56  95  66
2  77  76  15   3  44  77  97  24
3  48  83  68  56  92  27  23   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use methods like the "round robin" or "envy-free" algorithms. Let's try to achieve an envy-free allocation by considering each agent's preferences and distributing items so that no agent feels another has received a better allocation.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Preferences:** 
   - Each agent values items differently. We must recognize which items are most valuable to each agent.

2. **Prioritize Allocation:**
   - Allocate items based on the highest individual valuations first, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share over the entire allocation process.

3. **Allocate the Items:**
   - We will allocate one item at a time, prioritizing the highest value for the agent who values it most, then move to the next item and agent.

4. **Check for Envy-Freeness:**
   - Ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Let's execute this process:

**Allocations:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Values item 1 the highest (87). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
  - Next highest available is item 2 with a value of 62.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Values item 6 the highest (95). Assign item 6 to agent 1.
  - Next highest available is item 4 with a value of 83.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Values item 6 the highest (97), already allocated. Next is items 0 and 5 valued at 77. Assign item 5 to agent 2.

- **Agent 3:**
  - Values item 4 the highest (92), already allocated. Next is item 1 with a value of 83, already allocated. Next, item 3 is valued at 56.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 6, 4
- Agent 2: Items 5, 0
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items, and high-value items are distributed according to preferences. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
