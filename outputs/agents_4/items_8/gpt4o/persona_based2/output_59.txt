Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  78  74  66  87  49  68  15
1  31  93  31  80  45  34  86  55
2  26  50  17  30   2  27  72  20
3  79  21  22  78  90  17  29  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible, we can use a method where we try to maximize the minimum satisfaction of each agent. This involves distributing the items in such a way that each agent is content with their share as much as possible, based on their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Step 1: Assign the highest valued item for each agent where possible.**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 highly (87).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highly (93).
   - Agent 2 values item 6 highly (72).
   - Agent 3 values item 4 highly (90), but it's already chosen by Agent 0. The next highest is item 0 (79).

2. **Step 2: Allocate remaining items based on remaining highest values and ensuring no agent is left with zero items.**
   - For Agent 0, the next highest available items are 2 (74) and 3 (66).
   - For Agent 1, the next highest available item is 6 (86), but it's already chosen by Agent 2. The next available is 3 (80).
   - For Agent 2, the next highest available item is 7 (20).
   - For Agent 3, allocate another item to balance the allocation, e.g., item 5 (17).

**Allocations:**

- Agent 0: Items 4, 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 6, 7
- Agent 3: Items 0, 5

By following this allocation, we try to ensure that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, and the distribution is balanced.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
