Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  41   9  16  49  85  23  12
1  95  32  50  57  17  22  99  54
2  10  10   3  90  79  83  39  83
3  22  98  16  13  57  98  21  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering envy-freeness, we can employ a method that aims to equalize the perceived value of each agent's allocation as much as possible. Given the valuations, we'll try to distribute the items such that no agent envies another's allocation more than their own.

Here is a step-by-step plan for the allocation:

1. **Identify High-Valued Items:** 
   - Each agent has different valuations for the items. We should try to allocate items such that agents get higher-valued items according to their preferences.

2. **Greedy Allocation Approach:**
   - Distribute items one at a time, choosing the unallocated item that provides the most utility to any agent not yet satisfied with their allocation.
   - This approach aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent with their allocation.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - After a preliminary allocation, check if any agent is left with too low a total value compared to others, and if possible, swap items to improve fairness.

Given this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Value most item 0 (93), item 5 (85)
- **Agent 1:** Value most item 6 (99), item 0 (95)
- **Agent 2:** Value most item 3 (90), item 5 (83)
- **Agent 3:** Value most item 1 (98), item 5 (98)

To balance the allocation, we allocate as follows:

1. Agent 0 gets items: 0, 5
2. Agent 1 gets items: 6, 4
3. Agent 2 gets items: 3, 7
4. Agent 3 gets items: 1, 2

This distribution attempts to ensure that each agent gets a share that maximizes their own preferences while balancing total values.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
