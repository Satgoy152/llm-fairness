Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  35  70  18  23  48  76  80
1  67  58  14  55  12  42  68  15
2  32  45  78   2   0  68  32  16
3  84  45  83  19  72  71  72  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation, i.e., the allocation should aim for envy-freeness as much as possible. This can be challenging with integer allocations, but we will try to distribute items in a way that minimizes envy.

Here's how the valuations look:

| Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Agt0 | 1  | 35 | 70 | 18 | 23 | 48 | 76 | 80 |
| Agt1 | 67 | 58 | 14 | 55 | 12 | 42 | 68 | 15 |
| Agt2 | 32 | 45 | 78 | 2  | 0  | 68 | 32 | 16 |
| Agt3 | 84 | 45 | 83 | 19 | 72 | 71 | 72 | 61 |

To achieve an allocation that attempts to be as fair as possible, we can follow a heuristic approach that considers maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that the distribution is balanced. We proceed as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 7 the most. Assign item 7 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 the most. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 the most. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 the most. Assign item 3 to agent 3.

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

5. **Remaining Items**: Items 1, 4, 5, 6 are left. We need to distribute them fairly:

   - **Agent 0**: Assign item 6 (valued at 76) to agent 0.
   - **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (valued at 58) to agent 1.
   - **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (valued at 68) to agent 2.
   - **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 (valued at 72) to agent 3.

Now, each agent has 2 items, and we've considered their most valued items in the allocation where possible. This should minimize envy among the agents.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
