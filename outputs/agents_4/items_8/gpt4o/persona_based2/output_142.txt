Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  22  94  41  68  71  52  54
1  77   4  77   7   5  34  75  57
2  79  92  50  29  26  29  40  47
3   1  45  29  76  43  16  87  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to apply concepts from fair division, such as envy-freeness or maximizing the minimum utility. However, given that we are constrained to allocate exactly 8 items, we will focus on ensuring that each agent receives items in a way that considers their preferences as much as possible.

One simple approach is to use a method like the "round-robin" allocation, where we sequentially assign each agent their most valued unallocated item until all items are assigned. Here's how it could work in this case:

1. **Agent 0:** Most valued item is 2 (94), allocate item 2.
2. **Agent 1:** Most valued item is 0 (77), allocate item 0.
3. **Agent 2:** Most valued item is 1 (92), allocate item 1.
4. **Agent 3:** Most valued item is 6 (87), allocate item 6.
5. **Agent 0:** Next most valued item is 4 (68), allocate item 4.
6. **Agent 1:** Next most valued item is 6 (75) but already taken, next is 7 (57), allocate item 7.
7. **Agent 2:** Next most valued item is 5 (29), allocate item 5.
8. **Agent 3:** Next most valued item is 3 (76), allocate item 3.

This allocation respects the constraint of assigning exactly 8 items and attempts to give each agent some of their higher-valued items. Let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [6, 3]
}
```
