Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  55  58  20  15  71   6  98
1   2  94  19  83   8  77  50  53
2  37  14  71   7  90  71  12  33
3  99  10  49  74  54   3  95  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method called "round-robin" where each agent picks the most valuable remaining item for them. This ensures that each agent has a chance to pick the items they value most, minimizing envy.

Let's perform the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0** values item 7 the most (value: 98), so they pick item 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (value: 94), so they pick item 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (value: 90), so they pick item 4.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most (value: 99), so they pick item 0.

Now we repeat the process for the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0** now values item 0 the most, but it's taken. The next highest is item 5 (value: 71), so they pick item 5.
6. **Agent 1** now values item 3 the most (value: 83), so they pick item 3.
7. **Agent 2** now values item 2 the most (value: 71), so they pick item 2.
8. **Agent 3** now values item 6 the most (value: 95), so they pick item 6.

All items have been allocated. Here's how it looks for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Items [7, 5]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 3]
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 2]
- **Agent 3**: Items [0, 6]

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
