Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  73  91  36  45  56  57  76
1  54  86  60  25  91  65  51  84
2  58  24  55  37  49   3  98  44
3  49  24  31   8  72  62  45  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider various concepts such as envy-freeness and maximizing the total value for each agent. However, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, we'll try to balance the allocations based on the valuations provided.

Let's start by analyzing the preferences of each agent:

- Agent 0 values items 2 and 7 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 1 and 4 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 4 and 7 highly.

We can aim to allocate items in such a way that each agent's higher-valued items are prioritized. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items 2 and 7. These are highly valued by Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 1 and 4. These are highly valued by Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 0 and 6. Item 6 is highly valued and item 0 provides additional value.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items 3 and 5. These provide reasonable value to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value relatively well, and all 8 items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize fairness by considering the relative values each agent places on the items they receive, while ensuring all items are allocated.
