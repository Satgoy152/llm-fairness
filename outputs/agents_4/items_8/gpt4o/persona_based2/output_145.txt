Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  55  32   6   1  27  86   4
1  72  41  11  70  10  99  19  54
2  55  79  34   6  17  87  56  27
3  57  13  18  44  95  72  76  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute items so that no agent feels another has a better share.

To achieve this, we can use a strategy that aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives, given their individual preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List Total Valuations for Each Agent:** Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.

   - Agent 0: 243
   - Agent 1: 376
   - Agent 2: 361
   - Agent 3: 449

2. **Assign Items to Agents Based on Highest Value:** Begin by assigning each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no item is assigned more than once.

3. **Adjustments for Fairness:** After initial assignments, we may need to adjust to ensure each agent has a similar total valuation of items, which can help reduce envy.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (86), so allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (99), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (79), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (95), so allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (72) since Agent 1 values it the second highest.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (32) to balance the allocation.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (70) because it is also valued highly (second highest).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 (74) as it has a reasonable valuation.

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of their most valued items while trying to maintain balance.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [5, 0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the perceived total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets some of their higher-valued items.
