Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  22  85  46  48  37  78  55
1  91  10  54  27  27  64  19  61
2  85  39  87  19  13  40  84  28
3  51  24  60  76  81   9   0  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while taking into consideration their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. Given the constraints, we'll attempt to distribute the items so that each agent's satisfaction is maximized based on their valuations.

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highly: 0, 2, 6
- Agent 1 values items highly: 0, 5, 7
- Agent 2 values items highly: 0, 2, 6
- Agent 3 values items highly: 4, 3, 7

A strategy for a fair division is to assign the highest valued items to each agent while ensuring no overlaps, if possible.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items 0, 2, and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items 0, 5, and 7.
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items 0, 2, and 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Prioritize items 4, 3, and 7.

To ensure no overlap and maximize each agent's satisfaction, we can proceed with the following allocation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (high valuation and no overlap with Agent 1's highest)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (high valuation and no overlap with Agent 0's highest)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (shared interest with Agent 0, but Agent 0 already has item 2)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest interest item not overlapping with others)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1, 3, 6, and 7:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (second highest valuation)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (best remaining item for Agent 2)

Considering the allocations, here is the fair distribution of items:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences while keeping the overall distribution fair and envy-free to the greatest extent possible given the constraints.
