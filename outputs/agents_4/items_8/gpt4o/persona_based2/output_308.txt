Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  69  27  79  96  12  70  31
1  74  57  90   3  80  84  97  64
2  67  97  21  22  10  89  52  34
3  35  16  57  93  47  27  22  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy and maintains balanced value across agents. This aims to ensure that no agent feels another has received a significantly better allocation in terms of their own valuations.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
Agent 0: 28  69  27  79  96  12  70  31
Agent 1: 74  57  90   3  80  84  97  64
Agent 2: 67  97  21  22  10  89  52  34
Agent 3: 35  16  57  93  47  27  22  53
```

Let's proceed with a round-robin allocation strategy, taking into account the highest valuations for each item by the agents to ensure each agent is as satisfied as possible given the constraints.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 4 (96), Item 3 (79), Item 6 (70)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 6 (97), Item 2 (90), Item 5 (84)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 1 (97), Item 5 (89), Item 0 (67)
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: Item 3 (93), Item 2 (57), Item 7 (53)

Proposed Allocation Strategy:
- Agent 0 receives items: 4, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 5
- Agent 2 receives items: 1, 0
- Agent 3 receives items: 3, 7

This allocation roughly balances the total valuation each agent receives based on their own assessments, aiming to minimize envy and ensure fairness.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
