Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  31   4  92   8  86  58  38
1  60  83   1  77  70  65   8   5
2  66  17  90  17  61  63  19  13
3  95  77  12  34   1  12  52  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, we should consider both envy-freeness and maximizing each agent's valuation for their allocated items. Given the valuations, a natural approach is to use a round-robin allocation method or a similar strategy that maximizes the satisfaction of all agents. 

Let's examine the valuations matrix:

```
Agent 0: [28, 31, 4, 92, 8, 86, 58, 38]
Agent 1: [60, 83, 1, 77, 70, 65, 8, 5]
Agent 2: [66, 17, 90, 17, 61, 63, 19, 13]
Agent 3: [95, 77, 12, 34, 1, 12, 52, 57]
```

Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible and no agent envies another. Here is a proposed allocation:

1. **Item 0** (valued highest by Agent 3): Assign to Agent 3.
2. **Item 1** (valued highest by Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2** (valued highest by Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3** (valued highest by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4** (valued highest by Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5** (valued highest by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6** (valued highest by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7** (valued highest by Agent 3): Assign to Agent 3.

The allocation aims to distribute the items based on the highest valuation per item, ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly. We attempt to balance the allocations to prevent envy by ensuring everyone gets roughly equal value.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items they value highly, Agent 1 receives high-value items as per their preferences, Agent 2 receives their highest valued item, and Agent 3 gets the items they value the most.
