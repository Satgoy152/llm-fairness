Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  80  14  44  58  97  41  24
1  22  94   7  93  89  71  80  98
2  12  31  97  26  21  27  33  24
3  86  57  54  77   8   3  48  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels that they receive a fair share based on their valuations. One common approach to achieve this is the Envy-Free up to One Item (EF1) allocation, where no agent envies another agent's allocation after possibly removing one item from the other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations, a possible EF1 allocation can be achieved as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 0 and item 5 highly (both at 97), so we can allocate these to them.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 7 (valued at 94 and 98), so we allocate these to them.
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 97 and can also get item 6, which they value reasonably at 33.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3 (77) and item 4 (8), so we allocate these to them.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, minimizing the potential envy.

Now, let's organize the allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents, and each agent receives a set of items that should minimize envy based on their individual valuations.
