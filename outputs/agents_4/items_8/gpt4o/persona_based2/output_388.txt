Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81   7  23  18  59  41  68  90
1  18   6  57  87  20  14  61  39
2  68  38  77  10  26  64  93  50
3  49  56  59  57  78  61  62  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, or as close to envy-free as possible, considering the valuations provided. Envy-freeness means no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Let's first assess the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 81 + 7 + 23 + 18 + 59 + 41 + 68 + 90 = 387
- Agent 1's total valuation: 18 + 6 + 57 + 87 + 20 + 14 + 61 + 39 = 302
- Agent 2's total valuation: 68 + 38 + 77 + 10 + 26 + 64 + 93 + 50 = 426
- Agent 3's total valuation: 49 + 56 + 59 + 57 + 78 + 61 + 62 + 53 = 475

To allocate items fairly, we'll consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their share relative to their total valuation.

### Proposed Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize giving Agent 0 the items they value highly. Items 7, 0, and 6 are high-value items for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize giving Agent 1 the items they value highly. Item 3 is highly valued.
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize giving Agent 2 the items they value highly. Items 6 and 2 are high-value items for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Prioritize giving Agent 3 the items they value highly. Items 4 and 1 are highly valued.

### Allocation

Based on the strategy, we allocate items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 6
- **Agent 3**: Items 1, 4, 5

This allocation takes into account the highest-value items for each agent while attempting to distribute items fairly. Let's summarize this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving an allocation that includes items they highly value, aiming for fairness and minimizing envy.
