Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  52  76  21  48   7  80  55
1  75  47   1  91  78  11  54  24
2  43  91  48  33  31  45  15  85
3  81  16  95  80  81  12  18  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix you've provided, let's try to make an allocation that approaches envy-freeness as closely as possible.

Here's a breakdown of the agents' preferences:

- Agent 0 seems to value items 6, 2, and 1 highly.
- Agent 1 highly values items 3, 4, and 0.
- Agent 2 highly values items 1, 7, and 5.
- Agent 3 highly values items 2, 0, and 3.

To ensure a fair division, the items should be distributed such that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, but we can attempt to balance it as much as possible.

Here's a proposed allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Assign items [6, 1]. These are items valued highly by Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Assign items [3, 4]. These items are among the highest for Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Assign items [7, 5]. These items are highly valued by Agent 2.
- Agent 3: Assign items [0, 2]. These items are highly valued by Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning each agent some of their top-valued items. Let's format this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
