Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  59  19  11  32  92  29  21
1  10   9  52  22  77  30  28  47
2  94  77  33  25  86  76  43  22
3  28  62  55  66  97  47  37  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a manner that minimizes envy and ensures fairness. One effective way to achieve this is by using the Envy-Free algorithm, which involves assigning items to agents based on their valuations, ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations and make an allocation:

1. **Identify the total value each agent assigns to all items:**
   - Agent 0: 46 + 59 + 19 + 11 + 32 + 92 + 29 + 21 = 309
   - Agent 1: 10 + 9 + 52 + 22 + 77 + 30 + 28 + 47 = 275
   - Agent 2: 94 + 77 + 33 + 25 + 86 + 76 + 43 + 22 = 456
   - Agent 3: 28 + 62 + 55 + 66 + 97 + 47 + 37 + 86 = 478

2. **Allocate items to maximize total valuation per agent:**

- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest, so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest, so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest, so allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- Allocate the remaining items based on maximizing individual agent's value:

   - Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (77), assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (52), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (66), assign to Agent 3.
   - Item 6: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (43), assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 7: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (86), assign to Agent 3.

3. **Final allocation:**

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 6
- Agent 3: Items 3, 4, 7

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's valuation and attempts to minimize envy by distributing the items according to the highest individual valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 6],
    "3": [3, 4, 7]
}
```
