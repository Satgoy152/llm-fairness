Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81   7  83   5  27  78  84  16
1  21  13  43  96  86  55  80  39
2  70  49  93  96  46  39  65  16
3  72  88  74  20  98  85  48  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that takes into consideration their individual valuations, we can use an approach that aims for envy-freeness and efficiency. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations, we will try to allocate items such that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their individual satisfaction while aiming to minimize any potential envy.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 0, 2, and 6. We can allocate items 0 and 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 3. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 2. However, item 2 is already allocated to maximize fairness, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 4 and 1. We can allocate items 4, 1, and 7 to Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's highest preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4, 7, 2]
}
```

This allocation captures each agent's preferences while respecting the constraint that all 8 items are allocated. Note that some compromise is inevitable to maintain fairness.
