Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  87  18   5  97  50  94  48
1  90  77  94  16  42  48  36   3
2  57  33  14   7  76  42  74  11
3  97   8  61  23   1  35  32  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Compute the total value each agent assigns to all items to gauge their overall interest.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items they highly value, aiming to maximize individual satisfaction while trying to minimize envy.
3. **Adjustments for Fairness**: After initial allocation, check for any significant envy or imbalance and adjust accordingly to achieve a more equitable distribution.

Here is a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 475
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 406
   - Agent 2's total valuation: 314
   - Agent 3's total valuation: 346

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (97), item 6 (94).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (90), item 2 (94).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 4 (76), item 6 (74).
   - Agent 3 highly values item 0 (97), item 7 (89).

3. **Propose Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [4, 6] (Value: 97 + 94 = 191)
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 2] (Value: 90 + 94 = 184)
   - Agent 2: Items [5] (Value: 42)
   - Agent 3: Items [7, 3] (Value: 89 + 23 = 112)

4. **Check for Remaining Items and Adjust**:
   - Remaining items: 1
   - Agent 2 has the lowest total value, so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

5. **Final Adjustments**:
   - Verify all items are allocated and the allocation attempts to minimize envy.

Based on this strategy, the final allocation can be represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while considering their preferences and minimizing envy.
