Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  70  20  10  73  89  68  16
1  58  90  14  65  28  46  56  25
2  81  79  43  22  17  17   9  19
3  33  48  43  87  51  19  68  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own, based on their valuations of the items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High values: Item 5 (89), Item 4 (73)
   - Allocate items 5 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High values: Item 1 (90), Item 3 (65)
   - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High values: Item 0 (81), Item 2 (43)
   - Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - High values: Item 7 (72), Item 6 (68)
   - Allocate items 7 and 6 to Agent 3.

This allocation is designed to minimize envy, as each agent receives some of their most valued items.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and all 8 items are distributed accordingly.
