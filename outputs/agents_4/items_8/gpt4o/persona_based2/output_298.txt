Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  39  23  89  17  19  13  45
1  56  87   1  38  57   2  11  99
2  60  26  33  78  62  29  47  94
3  91   7  17  20  22  89  98  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent receives items such that they value their own bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle. However, achieving exact envy-freeness is challenging, so we will aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items based on maximizing the value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 (value 89). Assign item 3 to Agent 0. 

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 7 (value 99). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 7 (value 94), but it's already taken. The next highest value is item 3 (value 78), but it's also taken. The next highest value is item 0 (value 60). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 0 (value 91), but it's taken. The next highest is item 6 (value 98). Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations for each agent:

5. **Remaining Items**: 1, 2, 4, 5

- Agent 0 has items 1 (39), 2 (23), 4 (17), 5 (19) remaining.
- Agent 1 has items 1 (87), 4 (57), 5 (2) remaining.
- Agent 2 has items 1 (26), 2 (33), 4 (62), 5 (29) remaining.
- Agent 3 has items 1 (7), 2 (17), 4 (22), 5 (89) remaining.

6. **Allocate Remaining Items**:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value remaining for any agent 87).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (second highest value remaining for any agent 89).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (next highest value 62).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 23).

After these allocations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 2
- Agent 1: Items 7, 1
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4
- Agent 3: Items 6, 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and maximizes their valuations as much as possible under the constraints. 

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [6, 5]
}
```
