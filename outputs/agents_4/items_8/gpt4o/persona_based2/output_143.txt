Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  85  91  40  90  68  46  55
1   8  34  71  22  87  95  50  89
2  86   7  84  73  88  44  46  28
3  70  27  78  20  84  43  50  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To tackle the problem of fairly allocating items to agents while considering the agents' valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total welfare and aiming for envy-freeness if possible. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with an allocation that aims to maximize efficiency and fairness:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Value for Each Item
To determine the best allocation, first consider the total perceived value of each item by all agents:

- Item 0: 21 + 8 + 86 + 70 = 185
- Item 1: 85 + 34 + 7 + 27 = 153
- Item 2: 91 + 71 + 84 + 78 = 324
- Item 3: 40 + 22 + 73 + 20 = 155
- Item 4: 90 + 87 + 88 + 84 = 349
- Item 5: 68 + 95 + 44 + 43 = 250
- Item 6: 46 + 50 + 46 + 50 = 192
- Item 7: 55 + 89 + 28 + 47 = 219

### Step 2: Allocate Items
To achieve a fair allocation, we'll try to allocate items in such a way that each agent receives items that maximize their utility.

- **Agent 0**: Prefers item 2 (91) and item 4 (90).
- **Agent 1**: Prefers item 5 (95) and item 7 (89).
- **Agent 2**: Prefers item 0 (86) and item 4 (88).
- **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 (70) and item 4 (84).

Given these preferences and aiming for envy-freeness, we must carefully assign items to balance values:

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: [1, 2] (Total value = 85 + 91 = 176)
- **Agent 1**: [5, 7] (Total value = 95 + 89 = 184)
- **Agent 2**: [0, 3] (Total value = 86 + 73 = 159)
- **Agent 3**: [4, 6] (Total value = 84 + 50 = 134)

This allocation attempts to distribute items fairly, balancing the total received values among agents while respecting agents' preferences as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
