Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  29  55  92   2   2  28  77
1  64  26  74  62  95  26  36  92
2  48  89  66  27  70  72  33  77
3  63  40  31  25  87  92   9  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 29 55 92  2  2 28 77]
 [64 26 74 62 95 26 36 92]
 [48 89 66 27 70 72 33 77]
 [63 40 31 25 87 92  9 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use principles from fair division, particularly aiming for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own.

To achieve this, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring that the allocations are as balanced as possible across agents. Given the valuations in the table, our task is to make decisions based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value items for each agent and attempt to allocate them such that the agents have their most valued items.
2. Ensure each agent receives an approximately equal value of items, if not an equal number of items.
3. Adjust the allocations to prevent any envy, if possible.

### Allocation Steps:

- **Agent 0**: Valuation highlights are item 3 (92), item 7 (77). We'll start by giving them item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Valuation highlights are item 4 (95), item 7 (92). We'll assign item 4 to them.
- **Agent 2**: Valuation highlights are item 1 (89), item 5 (72). We'll allocate item 1 to them.
- **Agent 3**: Valuation highlights are item 5 (92), item 4 (87). Since item 4 is taken, we assign item 5 to them.

After initial allocations:

- **Agent 0**: [3]
- **Agent 1**: [4]
- **Agent 2**: [1]
- **Agent 3**: [5]

Remaining items: 0, 2, 6, 7

Now, we'll distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (77), increasing their total value.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (64), balancing their value.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (66), raising their value.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (9), completing their allocation.

Final allocations:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 7] - Total Value: 169
- **Agent 1**: [4, 0] - Total Value: 159
- **Agent 2**: [1, 2] - Total Value: 155
- **Agent 3**: [5, 6] - Total Value: 101

This allocation, while not perfectly envy-free due to inherent valuation differences, attempts to balance the total perceived value across the agents.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
