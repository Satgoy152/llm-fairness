Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  14  64  79   2   6  76  41
1  90  18  46  10  25   5  54  80
2  56  69  69  69   4  12  99  91
3  91  21  40  56  82  67  48  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, let's consider the valuations provided and attempt to distribute items such that each agent's allocation is as equitable as possible. The goal is to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they highly value relative to others.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Look for items that have significantly higher valuations by each agent compared to others.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High Valuations**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (80).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (90), but since agent 0 also values it highly, agent 1 may instead get item 7 (80).
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the most (99).
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the most (91), but since it is already preferred by others, agent 3 may instead get item 4 (82).

3. **Balance Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items based on minimizing overall envy:
   - Agent 0 has a strong secondary interest in items 3 (79) and 6 (76), but item 6 is already allocated to agent 2. So, assign item 3 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 can take items with moderate value like item 2 (46).
   - Agent 3 can take item 7 (86), which is second best for them.
   - Agent 2 has the option of item 7 (91), but it's already taken, so item 5 (12) can be for agent 2.

4. **Final Allocation**: Make sure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 7]
- Agent 2: [6, 5]
- Agent 3: [4, 1]

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and minimizes envy by assigning items based on high relative valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```

This distribution ensures all 8 items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
