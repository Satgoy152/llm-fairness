Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  38  86  52  80  87  59   1
1  60  69  38  66  15  98  63  11
2   3  59  18  34  77  34  23  31
3  76  22  27  16  42  56  21   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering each agent's valuation of the items, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should ideally prefer their own allocation to any other agent's allocation, based on their valuations.

To achieve this, one common method is to use algorithms like the adjusted winner procedure, the envy-free cake-cutting algorithm, or iterative auction-based approaches. However, in this context, we'll use a simpler heuristic approach due to the discrete nature of the items and the integer constraint.

### Heuristic Approach:
1. **Initial Allocation**: Start by giving each agent the item they value the most.
2. **Balancing**: Adjust allocations to balance the total value each agent receives, so no agent feels envious of another's allocation.
3. **Iterate**: Repeat adjustments until all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify highest-valued items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (95).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (98).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (77).
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest, but it's already taken. Next, item 5, also taken. Next, item 6 is highest available (21).

2. **Initial tentative allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [0]
   - Agent 1: [5]
   - Agent 2: [4]
   - Agent 3: [6]

3. **Allocate remaining items based on next highest preference and balance**:
   - Remaining items: 1, 2, 3, 7
   - Agent 0 next prefers item 2 (86).
   - Agent 1 next prefers item 1 (69).
   - Agent 2 next prefers item 1, but it's taken. Next, item 3 (34).
   - Agent 3 next prefers item 3, but it's taken. Next, item 2, also taken. Next, item 1, also taken. Next, item 7 (0).

4. **Finalize balancing and allocation**:
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 as they have lower total value.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 as they have lower total value.

### Final Allocations:
```
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation aims to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's preference according to their valuations.
