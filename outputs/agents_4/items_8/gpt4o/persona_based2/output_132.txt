Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  70  89  23  80  84  54  71
1  58  89  48  32  27  62  92  20
2  23  48  53  55  18  92  11  32
3  99  71  81  10   8  97  18  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that is envy-free or approximately envy-free, we can use a method that seeks to balance the total valuation that each agent receives. We aim for each agent to feel that they have received a fair share of the total value of items based on their own valuations.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 83 + 70 + 89 + 23 + 80 + 84 + 54 + 71 = 554
- Agent 1's total valuation: 58 + 89 + 48 + 32 + 27 + 62 + 92 + 20 = 428
- Agent 2's total valuation: 23 + 48 + 53 + 55 + 18 + 92 + 11 + 32 = 332
- Agent 3's total valuation: 99 + 71 + 81 + 10 + 8 + 97 + 18 + 84 = 468

Next, we need to distribute items such that the distribution is roughly proportional to their values or their preferences. A common approach is to use a method similar to the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division algorithms. However, due to the constraint of integer allocation, a heuristic approach can work as well.

Now let's allocate items while ensuring as much fairness as possible:

1. **Assign highest valued items to each agent**:
   - For Agent 0, the highest valued items are 2 (89) and 5 (84).
   - For Agent 1, the highest valued items are 6 (92) and 1 (89).
   - For Agent 2, the highest valued item is 5 (92), but since it's already allocated, let's try items 3 (55) and 2 (53).
   - For Agent 3, the highest valued items are 0 (99) and 5 (97).

2. **Finalize allocation**:
   Since some items are valued highly by multiple agents, we need to resolve these based on their total values or next highest preferences. Let's try to allocate so that the total perceived value of items received by each agent is balanced:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 6
- Agent 2: Items 3
- Agent 3: Items 5, 7

Thus, each agent receives items, and the allocation is as balanced as possible based on their valuations. Here is the json format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value among agents as much as possible given the constraint of integer allocations.
