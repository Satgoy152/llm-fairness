Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  64  23  84  60  37  44  88
1  66  30  46  41  84  76  71  40
2  65  64  31  34  55  97  33  85
3  71  28  43  64  99  53  75  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. This can be challenging, especially with integer allocations, but we can aim for a division that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Let's examine the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their preferences:

- Agent 0: 484
- Agent 1: 454
- Agent 2: 464
- Agent 3: 526

Since we have 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items, given that we need to allocate all items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each agent's value while trying to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 0 and 3. Assign these to Agent 0.
   - Allocated: [0, 3]

2. **Agent 1**: Highest value items are 4 and 5. Assign these to Agent 1.
   - Allocated: [4, 5]

3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 5 and 7, but 5 is already taken, so allocate the next highest available items, which are 7 and 1.
   - Allocated: [7, 1]

4. **Agent 3**: Remaining items are 2 and 6. Assign these to Agent 3.
   - Allocated: [2, 6]

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's value for the items they receive while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [7, 1],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```
