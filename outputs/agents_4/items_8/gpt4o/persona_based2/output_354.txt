Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  38  13  73  36  72  94  85
1  73  95  11   1  49  78   7  97
2  15  61  69  89  93  61  39  43
3  70  83  82  41  90  13   8  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives a fair share considering their individual valuations, and the allocation is envy-free as much as possible.

An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle. Given that we have to assign 8 items to 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. However, since valuations are not uniform, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, but we can aim to minimize envy.

We start by looking at the valuations and try to allocate items based on maximizing the value for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 6 (value 94) and 7 (value 85) the most.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 1 (value 95) and 7 (value 97) the most. Since item 7 is already chosen by Agent 0, they can have item 5 (value 78) as the second choice.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 4 (value 93) and 3 (value 89) the most.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 1 (value 83) and 4 (value 90). Since item 4 is already chosen by Agent 2, they can have item 0 (value 70) as the second choice.

Let's assign the items considering these preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Items 6 (94) and 7 (85)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 (95) and 5 (78)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 (89) and 4 (93)
- **Agent 3**: Items 0 (70) and 2 (82)

This allocation maximizes each agent's total valuation based on their top preferences and distributes items fairly.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
