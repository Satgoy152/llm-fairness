Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91   3   7  40  46  50  51  23
1  24  28  19  17   9  94  64  83
2  17  20  43  67  49  21  75  93
3  45  57  61  33  14  31  14  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To determine a fair allocation of items among agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where possible while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the constraints and valuations, we can use a heuristic approach to approximate fairness. 

Firstly, we identify items highly valued by specific agents and try to allocate them accordingly. We also aim to distribute the total value each agent receives as evenly as possible, considering their valuations for each item.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (91).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 (94).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 7 (93).
   - Agent 3 highly values item 2 (61).

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:**  
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 1.
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 2.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 3.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**  
   We attempt to allocate remaining items such that the total value for each agent is balanced.

   - Agent 0: Already has item 0. Add item 6, which is also of high value (51).
   - Agent 1: Already has item 5. Add item 1 (28).
   - Agent 2: Already has item 7. Add item 3 (67).
   - Agent 3: Already has item 2. Add item 4 (14).

4. **Review and Adjust if Necessary:**  
   Ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the totals are balanced as fairly as possible.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives a fair portion based on their preferences.
