Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  81  40  17  35  89  23  77
1  79  30  91  95  38  78  60  60
2  99  10  25  79  84  63  92   4
3  43  42  81  51  98  55  21  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To approach this fair division problem, we aim to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as any other allocation, according to their own valuations. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Given the table of valuations, one way to achieve an envy-free solution is to use a method like the "round-robin" where agents take turns picking items based on their highest valuations. However, since this is a computational problem, we need to check various allocations to find one that minimizes envy.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (89) and item 1 (81).
- Agent 1 highly values item 3 (95) and item 2 (91).
- Agent 2 highly values item 0 (99) and item 6 (92).
- Agent 3 highly values item 4 (98) and item 2 (81).

A possible fair allocation is:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives items 5 and 1.
   - Valuation: 89 (item 5) + 81 (item 1) = 170

2. **Agent 1**: Receives items 3 and 2.
   - Valuation: 95 (item 3) + 91 (item 2) = 186

3. **Agent 2**: Receives items 0 and 6.
   - Valuation: 99 (item 0) + 92 (item 6) = 191

4. **Agent 3**: Receives items 4 and 7.
   - Valuation: 98 (item 4) + 64 (item 7) = 162

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 items, and the envy is minimized given their respective valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
