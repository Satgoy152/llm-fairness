Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  12  41  67   5  19  62  27
1   9  46  28  92  68  56  12  27
2   1  35  66  39  88  59  18  39
3  85   0  17  99  35  87  60  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, I will aim for an envy-free distribution. Envy-freeness means that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent.

One approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or "Divide and Choose." However, given the complexity of these methods and the requirement to provide a solution here, I'll adopt a simpler approach to approximate fairness considering the valuations.

The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while ensuring no agent envies another. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by identifying the item each agent values the most and attempt to allocate it to them, if possible.

2. **Avoid Envy:** Ensure no agent feels another has received a more valuable allocation by balancing high-value items among the agents.

3. **Iterate Fairly:** Continue the allocation by iterating over remaining items and ensuring that each addition doesn't create an imbalance in perceived value.

Let's implement this:

### Step 1: Initial Allocation
- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (67), allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (92), but it's already allocated. Next, item 4 (68), allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (88), but it's allocated. Next, item 2 (66), allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (99), but it's allocated. Next, item 0 (85), allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

### Step 2: Continue Allocation
- Remaining items: 1, 5, 6, 7.
- Agent 0 has: [3]. Next highest is item 6 (62), allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has: [4]. Next highest is item 5 (56), allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has: [2]. Next highest is item 5 (59), but it's allocated. Next, item 7 (39), allocate 7 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 has: [0]. Next highest is item 5 (87), but it's allocated. Next, item 1 (0), allocate 1 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent receives approximately fair value based on their preferences.

### Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences and ensures that envy is minimized.
