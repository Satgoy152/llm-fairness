Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  88  48  41  56  99  13  97
1  71  63  63  70  47  42  81  75
2  87  48  13  47  49  58  97  38
3  52  41  70  18  38  11  59  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [52 41 70 18 38 11 59 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to achieve envy-freeness, meaning each agent should be at least as happy with their own allocation as they would be with anyone else's allocation, given their valuations. A common method to approach this problem is through an iterative process, considering each agent's preferences and trying to balance the allocations. 

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

| Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 40 | 88 | 48 | 41 | 56 | 99 | 13 | 97 |
| 1          | 71 | 63 | 63 | 70 | 47 | 42 | 81 | 75 |
| 2          | 87 | 48 | 13 | 47 | 49 | 58 | 97 | 38 |
| 3          | 52 | 41 | 70 | 18 | 38 | 11 | 59 | 13 |

The goal is to distribute the 8 items among the 4 agents to minimize envy.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 5 the highest with a value of 99. We allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest with a value of 71. We allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 the highest with a value of 97. We allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 the highest with a value of 70. We allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 0**: Next, Agent 0 values item 1 with 88. We allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1**: Next, Agent 1 values item 7 with 75. We allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 2**: Next, Agent 2 values item 3 with 47. We allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
8. **Agent 3**: Finally, Agent 3 values item 4 with 38. We allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

### Allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 1
- Agent 1: Items 0, 7
- Agent 2: Items 6, 3
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4

This allocation tries to respect the highest preferences of each agent iteratively and attempts to minimize overall envy.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are among their higher-valued choices, which should lead to a fair division under the constraints given.
