Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  53   8  10  80  33  19  88
1  47  87  95  82  91  70  35  69
2  69  19  84  54  21  62  31  16
3   6  73   3  96  12  20  11  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve a division that considers each agent's valuation of the items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, while attempting to make the allocation as envy-free as possible.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 7 highly (value of 88).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 highly (value of 95).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 highly (value of 84).
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly (value of 96).

Considering these high valuations, a plausible allocation strategy is to prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most, and then distribute the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 2]
- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 6]
- **Agent 3**: Items [3, 4]

Each agent receives two items, and the allocation respects the preferences for the most valued items as much as possible, given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents, and each agent receives at least one of their highly valued items.
