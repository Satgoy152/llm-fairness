Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  53   2  89  21  78  47  73
1  22  12  17  83  58  46  15  47
2  73  42  13  22  57  67  85  10
3  25  98  87  48  76   4  27  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we should consider each agent's preferences and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation. This problem is inherently complex, but a reasonable approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on their highest marginal value to any agent who hasn't yet received a fair share. Here's one way to proceed:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Try to allocate at least two items per agent, if possible, to ensure each agent has some value.
3. Aim to maximize each agent's total value by assigning the most valuable remaining items.

Let's proceed with this approach:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Values

- Agent 0: 64 + 53 + 2 + 89 + 21 + 78 + 47 + 73 = 427
- Agent 1: 22 + 12 + 17 + 83 + 58 + 46 + 15 + 47 = 300
- Agent 2: 73 + 42 + 13 + 22 + 57 + 67 + 85 + 10 = 369
- Agent 3: 25 + 98 + 87 + 48 + 76 + 4 + 27 + 32 = 397

### Step 2: Initial Allocation

We aim to distribute the items based on high individual valuations while ensuring fairness across the agents:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (89), Item 5 (78)
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (58), Item 3 (83)
- **Agent 2**: Item 6 (85), Item 5 (67)
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (98), Item 2 (87)

### Step 3: Adjust and Finalize Allocation

Now, let's adjust and ensure each item is allocated only once:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 since it's their highest preference.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 0.

Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This distribution attempts to balance the high-value items across all agents while ensuring each agent receives a substantial share of their preferred items.
