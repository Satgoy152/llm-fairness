Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  90  53  50   4  83  38  20
1  96  54  41  90  37  72  85  22
2  31  39  30  57  86  36  15  33
3  31  21  62  25  26  54  98  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 54 41 90 37 72 85 22]
 [31 39 30 57 86 36 15 33]
 [31 21 62 25 26 54 98 87]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 8 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

Let's analyze and allocate the items based on the given valuations:

### Valuation Table:
```
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  90  53  50   4  83  38  20
1  96  54  41  90  37  72  85  22
2  31  39  30  57  86  36  15  33
3  31  21  62  25  26  54  98  87
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items 0 and 1. Let's allocate items 0 and 1 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3. Allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4. Allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 6 and item 7. Allocate items 6 and 7 to agent 3.
5. Items 2 and 5 remain unallocated. Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 5 after items 0 and 1, so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
6. Item 2 can be allocated to agent 3, who has a relatively high valuation for it after items 6 and 7.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: Items [6, 7, 2]

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6, 7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is as fair as possible given the valuations.
