Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  99  98  12   9  34  31  14
1  90  31  64  62  45   7  51  36
2  59  25  49  92  36  66  55  58
3  30  22  57  90  25  21  59  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other agent's allocation, based on their personal valuations.

One method to achieve a fair division is the "round robin" or "sequential picking" method, which can be used when the number of items is divisible by the number of agents. In this case, 8 items for 4 agents means each agent should receive 2 items. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to ensure a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate the total valuation of each agent for all items:**
    - Agent 0: 382
    - Agent 1: 386
    - Agent 2: 440
    - Agent 3: 394

2. **Select items based on descending individual valuations:** 
    - We can rotate among agents, allowing each to pick their highest-valued remaining item until all items are allocated.

3. **Allocate items:**
    - **Round 1:** Highest valued item for each agent respectively, rotating in order:
        - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 99)
        - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 90)
        - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 92)
        - Agent 3 picks item 7 (value 90)
    - **Round 2:** Continue picking the next highest valued item:
        - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 98)
        - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 45)
        - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 66)
        - Agent 3 picks item 6 (value 59)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [7, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the available valuations.
