Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  34   2  11  89  29   5  44
1  29  24  80  91  21  47  79   0
2  34   1  56  24  95  32  82  49
3  10  65  24  83  25  16  21  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering envy-freeness, we can apply an algorithm such as the "Round Robin" or "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) approach. Given the valuations each agent assigns to the items, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies another, or at least the envy is minimized.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:**
   - Each agent has distinct high-value items. For example:
     - Agent 0 values item 4 highly (89).
     - Agent 1 values item 3 highly (91).
     - Agent 2 values item 4 highly (95).
     - Agent 3 values item 1 highly (65).

2. **Initial Allocation of High-Value Items:**
   - Allocate the most valued items to each agent where possible:
     - Agent 0 gets item 4.
     - Agent 1 gets item 3.
     - Agent 2 gets item 6 (82) since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0.
     - Agent 3 gets item 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Ensure each agent gets at least one item and that allocations are as envy-free as possible:
     - Agent 0 gets item 7 (44) after item 4.
     - Agent 1 gets item 2 (80).
     - Agent 2 gets item 0 (34) alongside item 6.
     - Agent 3 gets item 5 (16).

4. **Check for Envy and Adjust if Necessary:**
   - Adjust allocations if there are significant envy issues. In this case, the allocation seems reasonably balanced, with each agent receiving items that match at least some of their high preferences.

5. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, with a distribution that minimizes envy based on the initial valuation preferences. Each agent's high-value preferences are considered, and the total allocation sums to 8 items.
