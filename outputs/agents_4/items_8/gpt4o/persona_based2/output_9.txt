Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  45  66  75  67  47  48  55
1  52  12  82  53  10  87  29  94
2  55  86  30  56  92  33  70  98
3  82  22  90  89  67  76   8   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. Our goal is to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations, ideally achieving envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another's allocation over their own.

Let's start by examining the agents' highest valuations for each item and attempt to allocate items such that each agent is satisfied with the items they receive.

### Step-by-step Allocation Approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highest (75).
   - Agent 1 values item 7 highest (94).
   - Agent 2 values item 7 highest (98), but since Agent 1 also highly values it, we'll consider other high-value items for Agent 2 such as item 4 (92).
   - Agent 3 values item 2 highest (90).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Values:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 5, 6.
   - Agent 0 can get item 0 (70), as it is the next highest value for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 can have item 5 (87), which is a high value for them.
   - For item 6, Agent 2 values it reasonably high (70) compared to others.
   - The remaining item 1 can go to Agent 3, who values it second-highest among available items (22).

### Final Allocation:

With this approach, each agent receives items close to their high-value preferences, aiming for a fair distribution.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, striving for an envy-free allocation under the given constraints.
