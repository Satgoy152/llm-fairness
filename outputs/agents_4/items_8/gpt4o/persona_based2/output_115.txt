Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  14  75  44  45  14  89  19
1  92  30  80  25   4  94  14  27
2  95  51   3  72  43  79  28  47
3   1  13  91  17  75  90  71  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 30 80 25  4 94 14 27]

 [ 1 13 91 17 75 90 71 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible, where each agent believes they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the valuations provided, let's analyze and distribute the items:

**Agent 0:**
- Prefers item 6 (value 89) and item 2 (value 75).

**Agent 1:**
- Prefers item 5 (value 94) and item 0 (value 92).

**Agent 2:**
- Prefers item 0 (value 95) and item 5 (value 79).

**Agent 3:**
- Prefers item 5 (value 90) and item 2 (value 91).

To achieve a fair division, we must consider these preferences and attempt to distribute items in a way that reflects the highest valuations for each agent while balancing the overall allocation.

1. **Agent 0:** Receives item 6 and item 3.
   - Items: 6 (value 89), 3 (value 44).
   
2. **Agent 1:** Receives item 5 and item 1.
   - Items: 5 (value 94), 1 (value 30).

3. **Agent 2:** Receives item 0 and item 7.
   - Items: 0 (value 95), 7 (value 47).

4. **Agent 3:** Receives item 2 and item 4.
   - Items: 2 (value 91), 4 (value 75).

All items are allocated with each agent receiving two items, and the distribution attempts to reflect the agents' preferences as closely as possible.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
