Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  51   3  95  30  56  87  53
1  74  73  55  12  24  53   6  49
2  51  85  53  39   4  90  23  36
3  87   3  49  50  88  55  61  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find an envy-free allocation for the given problem, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they are getting a fair share according to their own valuation. One method to achieve this is the "Round Robin" or "Sequential Allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool of items until all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 50, 51, 3, 95, 30, 56, 87, 53
Agent 1: 74, 73, 55, 12, 24, 53, 6, 49
Agent 2: 51, 85, 53, 39, 4, 90, 23, 36
Agent 3: 87, 3, 49, 50, 88, 55, 61, 58
```

Let's proceed with allocating items in a fair manner:

1. **First Round of Picks:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 95).
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 74).
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 90).
   - Agent 3 picks item 4 (value 88).

2. **Second Round of Picks:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 87).
   - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 73).
   - Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 53).
   - Agent 3 picks item 7 (value 58).

The allocation is now complete with all items distributed among the agents. Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

Each agent has received at least one item, and the allocation is based on their preferences, satisfying the condition of a fair division.
