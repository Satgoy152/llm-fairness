Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  97  27  70  53  58  57  93
1   9  59  77  13  56  62   4   2
2   2  45  57  95  65  14  67  35
3  35   4   5  47  50  51  23  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents such that there is no envy (envy-freeness), we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This will ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value as perceived by them.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process
1. **Initial Observations:**  
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 7.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 highly.
   - Agent 3 has relatively low valuations across all items.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**  
   We will start by assigning the most valued items to each agent and then distribute the remaining items to maximize each agent's minimum value.

3. **Assigning High-Value Items:**  
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as it has high value for them (97).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valued item (77).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 as it is their highest valued item (95).

4. **Distributing Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 93 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 62 for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 65 for Agent 2).
   - Assign items 0 and 6 to Agent 3 to balance the distribution (values 35 and 23 for Agent 3, respectively).

### Final Allocations:
Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, while also balancing the total valuations to achieve a fair division. Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
