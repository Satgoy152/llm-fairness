Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  90  66  81  49  62  16   5
1  59  64  31  51  87  96  45  28
2  53  72  90  23  78  23  41   4
3  51  90  68  87   6  82  89  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the goal of minimizing envy, a commonly used method is to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Here, I will use a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items, focusing on balancing the total valuation each agent receives:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that attempts to equalize the total value received by each agent.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 62 + 90 + 66 + 81 + 49 + 62 + 16 + 5 = 431
- Agent 1's total valuation: 59 + 64 + 31 + 51 + 87 + 96 + 45 + 28 = 461
- Agent 2's total valuation: 53 + 72 + 90 + 23 + 78 + 23 + 41 + 4 = 384
- Agent 3's total valuation: 51 + 90 + 68 + 87 + 6 + 82 + 89 + 11 = 484

Next, I will allocate items to agents based on their valuations, aiming to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives a fair share.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: [1, 2]
   - Total value: 90 + 66 = 156

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: [4, 5]
   - Total value: 87 + 96 = 183

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items: [0, 6]
   - Total value: 53 + 41 = 94

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items: [3, 7]
   - Total value: 87 + 11 = 98

Each agent receives exactly 2 items, and we've distributed all 8 items. The allocations are as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Finally, here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
