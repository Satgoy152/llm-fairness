Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  23  65  36  19  76  72  12
1  53  78  19  66  81  96  90  48
2  55  94  11  51   9  86  75  32
3  58  82  62  83  30  79  30  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other allocation, given their valuations. Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should roughly get 2 items. 

Let's start by examining the valuations and attempt to allocate items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High values are for items 0 (72) and 5 (76).
2. **Agent 1**: High values are for items 5 (96) and 6 (90).
3. **Agent 2**: High values are for items 1 (94) and 5 (86).
4. **Agent 3**: High values are for items 3 (83) and 1 (82).

Let's attempt an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 6 and 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 5
- **Agent 3**: Items 3 and 4

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring everyone gets 2 items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an allocation they can be satisfied with.
