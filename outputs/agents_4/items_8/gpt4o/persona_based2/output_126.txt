Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  47   8  56  73   0  82  79
1  61  78  89  86  45  19  88  64
2  71  36  57  58  63  65  30   7
3  13  59  69  12  14  46  99  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 59 69 12 14 46 99 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the goal of minimizing envy, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation relative to the others. This involves analyzing the valuation matrix and finding an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

- Agent 0: [58, 47, 8, 56, 73, 0, 82, 79]
- Agent 1: [61, 78, 89, 86, 45, 19, 88, 64]
- Agent 2: [71, 36, 57, 58, 63, 65, 30, 7]
- Agent 3: [13, 59, 69, 12, 14, 46, 99, 37]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 6 (82) and 7 (79), so these items are allocated to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 2 (89) and 3 (86), so these items are allocated to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 5 (65), so this item is allocated to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 6 (99), but it's already allocated. Instead, allocate items 1 (59) and 4 (14) to Agent 3.

Now, we need to ensure that all 8 items are allocated:

- Item 0 (valued at 58 by Agent 0) can also be allocated to Agent 0.
- This leaves item 4, which is valued the least by the remaining agents. We can allocate it to Agent 3.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Items 1, 4

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while respecting the constraints.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
