Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  48  98  17  62  39   3  59
1   8  89  13  53  91  32  11  38
2  28   0   0  62  40   4  68  38
3  50  18  77  47  23  60  13  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 89 13 53 91 32 11 38]

 [50 18 77 47 23 60 13 62]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among agents, which is a key concept in fair division. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Compute Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: 396
   - Agent 1: 335
   - Agent 2: 240
   - Agent 3: 350

2. **Initial Preferences:**
   - Sort preferences for each agent based on their valuations.

3. **Greedy Allocation:**
   - Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Prefers item 2 (value 98), item 0 (value 70), item 1 (value 48)
  
- **Agent 1:** 
  - Prefers item 4 (value 91), item 1 (value 89)
  
- **Agent 2:** 
  - Prefers item 6 (value 68), item 3 (value 62)
  
- **Agent 3:** 
  - Prefers item 2 (value 77), item 5 (value 60)

### Final Allocation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 as it is their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

- Check for remaining unassigned items (0, 1, 3, 7).

- Allocate these remaining items based on maximizing individual satisfaction without causing envy:
  - Agent 0 gets item 0.
  - Agent 1 gets item 3.
  - Agent 2 gets item 7.
  - Agent 3 gets item 1.

### Resulting Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction while ensuring everyone receives at least one item, and the allocation is relatively envy-free given the constraints.
