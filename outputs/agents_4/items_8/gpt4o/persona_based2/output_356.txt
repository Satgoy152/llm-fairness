Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  81  80  70  44  61  69  37
1  96  85  11  52  87  17  51  77
2   0  35  19  10  10   6  11   6
3  91  76   8  30  34  16  85  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, it's essential to ensure that the division is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuation matrix, the goal is to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their assigned items based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most, followed by items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 has relatively low valuations across all items compared to other agents.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 6.

One possible approach is to start by assigning items with the highest individual valuations to the respective agents and then distribute the remaining items to minimize envy.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, since they value it the highest.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation and would likely want it.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, who values it highly as well.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, who also values it highly.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, who values it more than others.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2, who otherwise has very low valuations.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 3, who values it highly.
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 3, who values it highly as well.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 4
- Agent 2 gets items: 5
- Agent 3 gets items: 6, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value relatively highly, while also attempting to balance the overall distribution to minimize potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```
