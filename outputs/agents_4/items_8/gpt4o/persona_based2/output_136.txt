Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  95  27  95  66  21  25  72
1  19  36  40  55  58  80  26  49
2  74  40  51  74  48  23  84  57
3  77  91  13  77  43  92  64  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to use algorithms like the adjusted winner procedure, but given the constraints of this problem, I'll use a heuristic approach to achieve a fair allocation.

### Step-by-step Process:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent has different valuations for the items.
   - We aim to allocate all 8 items among the 4 agents.

2. **Greedy Allocation**:
   - Start by assigning each agent their most-valued item to ensure initial satisfaction.
   - Then, distribute the remaining items to minimize envy.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for items 1 and 3 (95 each). Allocate item 1.
   - **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (80). Allocate item 5.
   - **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (84). Allocate item 6.
   - **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 5, but it is taken. Next highest is item 1 (91), but it is taken. Allocate item 0 (77).

4. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items are 2, 3, 4, and 7.
   - Allocate to minimize the maximum dissatisfaction.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - **Agent 0**: Allocated item 1. Next highest available valuation is item 3 (95). Allocate item 3.
   - **Agent 1**: Allocated item 5. Next highest available valuation is item 3 (55), but it is taken. Next is item 4 (58). Allocate item 4.
   - **Agent 2**: Allocated item 6. Next highest available valuation is item 3 (74), but it is taken. Next is item 7 (57). Allocate item 7.
   - **Agent 3**: Allocated item 0. Next highest available valuation is item 3 (77), but it is taken. Next is item 2 (13). Allocate item 2.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items that are relatively valuable to them, helping to achieve a fair division.
