Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  66   2  85  70  84  47  87
1  80  13  47  74  94  61  42  35
2   6  95  22  13  18  73   8  92
3  57  16  97  22  31  96  54  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that their perceived value is as equitable as possible. One way to approach this problem is to use the notion of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

First, let's calculate the total value that each agent ascribes to all items:

- Agent 0: 68 + 66 + 2 + 85 + 70 + 84 + 47 + 87 = 509
- Agent 1: 80 + 13 + 47 + 74 + 94 + 61 + 42 + 35 = 446
- Agent 2: 6 + 95 + 22 + 13 + 18 + 73 + 8 + 92 = 327
- Agent 3: 57 + 16 + 97 + 22 + 31 + 96 + 54 + 88 = 461

Next, we allocate the items in a way that tries to balance these perceived values across all agents. We'll aim for each agent to receive approximately one-fourth of the total value, trying to minimize envy among agents.

1. **Allocate items by perceived value:**
   - Start by assigning items that have the highest individual values to the agents who value them most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

2. **Iterate and adjust allocations:**
   - Adjust allocations to ensure no agent envies another by checking if swapping items reduces envy.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items [0, 5], total value: 68 + 84 = 152
- Agent 1: Allocate items [4, 1], total value: 94 + 13 = 107
- Agent 2: Allocate items [7, 3], total value: 92 + 13 = 105
- Agent 3: Allocate items [2, 6], total value: 97 + 54 = 151

This distribution attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent and minimizes envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```
