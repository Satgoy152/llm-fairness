Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  14  52  47  70   1  22  70
1  36  51  69  51  57  79  72  22
2  58  42  39  99  33  45  44  78
3  42  24   0  42  20   1  24  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division, we need to allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

One approach is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or the "Maximum Nash Welfare" criterion to guide our decision. However, since the problem is discrete and involves integer allocations of items, we may need to approximate a fair allocation.

Let's try to assign the items in a way that balances the total valuation each agent receives:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign items iteratively to the agent who values them the most, ensuring a balanced distribution.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign item 3 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest at 99.
- Assign item 5 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest at 79.
- Assign item 7 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it at 78.
- Assign item 4 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 70.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest at 51 and agent 0 has already received one high-value item.
- Assign item 2 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 52, balancing the high values.
- Assign item 6 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it at 72, and they have received fewer items.
- Assign item 0 to agent 3, as agent 3 has not received any items yet.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [5, 1, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while considering the highest individual valuations for each item.
