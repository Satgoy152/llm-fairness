Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  94  93  87  44  77   2  63
1  89  97  50  93  44   5  23  76
2  66   3   0  16  81   1  10  25
3  91  81  42  73  97  93  40  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [91 81 42 73 97 93 40 50]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that they have received the best possible allocation given the constraints. We aim to distribute the items so that no agent envies another agent's allocation. 

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  94  93  87  44  77   2  63
1  89  97  50  93  44   5  23  76
2  66   3   0  16  81   1  10  25
3  91  81  42  73  97  93  40  50
```

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively higher valuation for item 4 compared to others.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 5.

By considering these preferences and attempting to avoid envy, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items that they value highly and that do not cause significant envy. We can give them items 1 and 2.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items that are valuable to them. We can give them items 0 and 3.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4, which they value highly.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 5, 6, and 7. Items 5 and 7 are less valued by others, and item 6 can be accommodated here.

This allocation ensures that:
- Each agent receives items they value relatively highly.
- The allocation minimizes potential envy among agents.

Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation adheres to the constraints of distributing all 8 items among the agents while considering their valuations.
