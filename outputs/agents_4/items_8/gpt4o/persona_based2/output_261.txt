Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  92  84  80  19  62  13   0
1  46  10  36  65  58  43  32   0
2  20   5   2  68  23  45   7  73
3  14  29  96  12  95  24  11  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a manner that is envy-free, we need to consider both the valuations each agent assigns to the items and the requirement that each agent receives an integer number of items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own.

Given the valuations, we can employ a round-robin approach, where agents take turns picking the most valued item that remains, ensuring a fair distribution. Here's how it can be done:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (value 92). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most (value 46). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 7 the most (value 73). Assign item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the most (value 96). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 0** still has high value for item 3 (value 80). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1** next prefers item 4 (value 58). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2** next prefers item 5 (value 45). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3** next prefers item 6 (value 11). Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, reducing the potential for envy.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```
