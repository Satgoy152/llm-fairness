Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  94  56  60  88  63  58  52
1  88  70  64  96  95  25  48   8
2  87  85  65   7  57  60  57  96
3  15  15  93   0   8  58  85  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items such that they feel that their share is as fair as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the table of valuations, let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** 
   - For each agent, identify items with the highest valuations. This will help ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly.

2. **Prioritize High Valuation:** 
   - Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Iterate & Adjust:** 
   - Adjust the assignment iteratively to balance the distribution of total values among agents.

Let's start the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest values: Item 1 (94), Item 4 (88)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Highest values: Item 3 (96), Item 4 (95)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Highest values: Item 7 (96), Item 1 (85)

- **Agent 3**: 
  - Highest values: Item 2 (93), Item 6 (85)

Allocation Process:
1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (94 value) and remove it from others' options.
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (96 value) and remove it from others' options.
3. Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (96 value) and remove it from others' options.
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 3 (93 value) and remove it from others' options.

Remaining allocation:
5. Agent 0 has Item 1, next highest is Item 5 (63).
6. Agent 1 has Item 3, next highest is Item 4 (95).
7. Agent 2 has Item 7, next highest is Item 0 (87).
8. Agent 3 has Item 2, next highest is Item 6 (85).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [7, 0]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 6]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7, 0],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```
