Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  61  73  26  22  68  80  47
1  69  32  19  44  12  24  73  31
2  30  75  52  76   7  63  90  28
3  41  67  14  54  11  61   0  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent is reasonably satisfied with their bundle of items. This often involves balancing the valuations such that no agent feels another has a more desirable set of items.

One approach to achieve a fair division is using an algorithm like the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) allocation, which attempts to ensure that any envy an agent might feel towards another can be eliminated by removing at most one item from the envied agent's bundle.

Let's consider the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [32, 61, 73, 26, 22, 68, 80, 47]
Agent 1: [69, 32, 19, 44, 12, 24, 73, 31]
Agent 2: [30, 75, 52, 76, 7, 63, 90, 28]
Agent 3: [41, 67, 14, 54, 11, 61, 0, 56]
```

We'll try to allocate the items such that each agent receives a bundle with a relatively balanced total valuation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [6, 5] (Valuation: 80 + 68 = 148)
2. **Agent 1**: Items [0, 3] (Valuation: 69 + 44 = 113)
3. **Agent 2**: Items [2, 1] (Valuation: 52 + 75 = 127)
4. **Agent 3**: Items [7, 4] (Valuation: 56 + 11 = 67)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences, and the total valuation for each agent is balanced to reduce potential envy.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation is designed to minimize envy by considering both the total valuation each agent receives and their individual preferences for the items.
