Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  72  77  39   6  47  62  49
1  65  67  57  39  46  23  89  79
2  55  67  77  57  99   5  72  64
3  25  45  99  97  94  61  65  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while aiming for envy-freeness. This means we want each agent to feel that their allocated items are at least as valuable as those of any other agent. Given that there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally get 2 items.

Let's compute an allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations**: 
   - Items 0, 1, and 2 have high valuations for Agent 0 (85, 72, and 77 respectively).

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations**:
   - Items 6 and 7 have high valuations for Agent 1 (89 and 79 respectively).

3. **Agent 2's highest valuations**:
   - Items 4 and 2 have high valuations for Agent 2 (99 and 77 respectively). However, item 2 is also highly valued by Agent 0, so we may need to adjust our choice.

4. **Agent 3's highest valuations**:
   - Items 2 and 3 have high valuations for Agent 3 (99 and 97 respectively). 

By examining the highest valuations and ensuring that we distribute items fairly, we can propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 1.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 6 and 7.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 4 and 5.
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 2 and 3.

This distribution aims to maximize the valuation for each agent given their preferences and ensures that each agent receives two items.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
