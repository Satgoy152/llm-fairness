Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  22  71  46  85  37  42  64
1  65  28  75  10  16  44  47  11
2  13  33  38  11  18  49  75  24
3  40  24  84  43  77  66  96   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item. Our goal is to achieve a division where each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations. A common approach in fair division is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

To start, we can use a heuristic or algorithmic approach to approximate a fair allocation. One simple heuristic is to use a round-robin or balanced bidding strategy, where agents take turns choosing items they value most until all items are allocated. However, given the size and complexity of the problem, we can aim for a balanced allocation based on the values provided:

### Step-by-Step Allocation Strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 2 + 22 + 71 + 46 + 85 + 37 + 42 + 64 = 369
   - Agent 1: 65 + 28 + 75 + 10 + 16 + 44 + 47 + 11 = 296
   - Agent 2: 13 + 33 + 38 + 11 + 18 + 49 + 75 + 24 = 261
   - Agent 3: 40 + 24 + 84 + 43 + 77 + 66 + 96 + 9 = 439

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Value First (Greedy Approach):**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Adjust Allocations to Ensure Each Agent Receives at Least One Item:**
   - Reallocate items as needed to ensure fairness and that each agent has at least one item.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 4, 7
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 6
- **Agent 2:** Items 5
- **Agent 3:** Items 1, 2, 3

This allocation is designed to be as balanced as possible, ensuring that no agent feels significantly worse off than others based on their valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and distribute items according to the highest valuations while adjusting to ensure all agents receive items.
