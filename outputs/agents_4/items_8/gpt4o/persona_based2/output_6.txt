Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  25  20  80  22  88  47   2
1  67  69  65  84  57  46  81  81
2  41  74  44  94  76  58  75   3
3  67  29   8   4  86   7  72  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle. 

One approach to achieve this is to use the "round robin" method, where each agent, in turn based on some order, picks their most preferred available item until all items are allocated. Let's implement this method and check for potential envy.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - We have 4 agents and 8 items.
   - Each agent will ideally get 2 items since \( \frac{8 \text{ items}}{4 \text{ agents}} = 2 \text{ items per agent} \).

2. **Round Robin Allocation**:
   - Order the agents: 0, 1, 2, 3.
   - Each agent selects their most valued item among the remaining ones in their turn.

3. **Agent Preferences**:
   - Agent 0: [5, 3, 6, 1, 4, 2, 0, 7]
   - Agent 1: [3, 6, 7, 1, 0, 2, 4, 5]
   - Agent 2: [3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7]
   - Agent 3: [4, 0, 6, 1, 7, 2, 5, 3]

4. **Allocation Process**:
   - Round 1:
     - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 88).
     - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 84).
     - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 74).
     - Agent 3 picks item 4 (value 86).
   - Round 2:
     - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 47).
     - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 81).
     - Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 41).
     - Agent 3 picks item 2 (value 8).

5. **Final Allocations**:
   - Ensure each agent has 2 items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation is done to balance the preferences and values for each agent as much as possible, given the constraints.
