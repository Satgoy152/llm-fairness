Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  77  44  72  69  40  21  74
1  91  62   9  72  73  27  49  19
2  42  89  32  46  43  48   0  20
3  40  13  96  55  68  60  90  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the envy-free criterion, which aims to ensure that no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the complexity and the limitation of integer allocations, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible, but we can aim for a fair distribution based on maximizing each agent's total valuation.

Let's summarize the agents' preferences and then decide on an allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 values items: [25, 77, 44, 72, 69, 40, 21, 74]
- Agent 1 values items: [91, 62, 9, 72, 73, 27, 49, 19]
- Agent 2 values items: [42, 89, 32, 46, 43, 48, 0, 20]
- Agent 3 values items: [40, 13, 96, 55, 68, 60, 90, 35]

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share, taking into account their preferences.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify the highest value item for each agent**: Start by assigning each agent their highest valued item, as this maximizes their satisfaction. 

2. **Sequentially assign remaining items**: After each agent receives one item, continue assigning the remaining items by choosing the item that provides the highest remaining value to any agent while attempting to balance the total value received by each agent.

3. **Adjust for fairness**: If possible, adjust allocations to improve fairness without reducing satisfaction.

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Initial High Value Allocations**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 77)
   - Agent 1 gets item 0 (value 91)
   - Agent 2 gets item 1 (already taken by 0, so next highest is item 5, value 48)
   - Agent 3 gets item 2 (value 96)

2. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items are: [3, 4, 6, 7]
   - Assign these to maximize remaining satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

3. **Final Allocation Considerations**:
   - Allocate items to ensure each agent ends up with at least one item, and distribute remaining items to maximize the sum of valuations.

### Final Allocations

Considering the above strategy, below is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's total satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.
