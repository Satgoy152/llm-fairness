Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  60  98  27  30  97  66  46
1  53  47  58  54  67  45  79  50
2  72  93   6  27  27  12   1   3
3  15  37  64  95  57  74  39  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To approach the fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. This involves considering each agent's valuation of the items and distributing the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to others.

Let's first examine the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  60  98  27  30  97  66  46
1  53  47  58  54  67  45  79  50
2  72  93   6  27  27  12   1   3
3  15  37  64  95  57  74  39  74
```

A fair division strategy often used is to allocate the highest valued items to each agent. However, this needs to be balanced to ensure each agent receives items and no items are left unallocated.

One way to proceed is to assign items iteratively, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation:

1. **Highest Valuation Allocation**: Allocate the items based on the highest valuation by each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
   
2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Adjust allocations to balance the total value received by each agent, ensuring no envy is created if possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Values item 2 the highest (value 98).
- Agent 1: Values item 6 the highest (value 79).
- Agent 2: Values item 1 the highest (value 93).
- Agent 3: Values item 3 the highest (value 95).

After assigning these high-value items, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Items left: 0, 4, 5, 7.
- Allocate them to balance the total value.

Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 5 (Values: 98 + 97 = 195)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6 (Values: 53 + 79 = 132)
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4 (Values: 93 + 27 = 120)
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7 (Values: 95 + 74 = 169)

This gives each agent 2 items, and while not perfectly envy-free, it attempts to balance the allocation based on the highest values and the remaining items.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
