Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  64  75  41  49  30  17  60
1  61  23  70  59  60  36  23  19
2  56  13  15  21  43  23  97  60
3   8   8  22  10  64  79  70  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 24     | 64     | 75     | 41     | 49     | 30     | 17     | 60     |
| 1     | 61     | 23     | 70     | 59     | 60     | 36     | 23     | 19     |
| 2     | 56     | 13     | 15     | 21     | 43     | 23     | 97     | 60     |
| 3     | 8      | 8      | 22     | 10     | 64     | 79     | 70     | 71     |

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we will use the following approach:

1. **Direct Assignment:** Try to assign the items based on the highest unique valuation, ensuring no agent envies another. This means prioritizing items based on unique high valuations to specific agents.

2. **Balancing Assignments:** Consider each agent's total value after initial assignments and adjust to balance total value across agents.

Let's follow through with these steps:

- Agent 0 has a strong preference for item 2 (75) and item 1 (64). 
- Agent 1 values item 0 (61) highly and also item 4 (60).
- Agent 2 has an exceptionally high valuation for item 6 (97).
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 5 (79) and 7 (71).

Based on these preferences, an initial allocation can be:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for item 2).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 0).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for item 6).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for item 5).

After these assignments, we still have items 1, 3, 4, and 7 to allocate:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it more than other remaining items.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their next highest valuation.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, balancing out valuations.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3, as they value it highly and it balances their allocation.

Now, let's check our allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 6
- Agent 3: Items 5 and 7

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
