Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  99  83  74  43  38   4  89
1  57  86  17  94   2  99  10  37
2  43  52   4  36  23  60   9  86
3  71  24  62  21  31  28  28  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure an equitable distribution. One common method to achieve this is to use a round-robin allocation system based on the valuations provided. However, given the nature of this problem, we will try to approximate an envy-free allocation as closely as possible. 

First, let's summarize the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 42 + 99 + 83 + 74 + 43 + 38 + 4 + 89 = 472
- Agent 1: 57 + 86 + 17 + 94 + 2 + 99 + 10 + 37 = 402
- Agent 2: 43 + 52 + 4 + 36 + 23 + 60 + 9 + 86 = 313
- Agent 3: 71 + 24 + 62 + 21 + 31 + 28 + 28 + 47 = 312

Given the total valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that the sum of the items allocated to each agent is as balanced as possible, while taking into account individual preferences.

Hereâ€™s an allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (99), 2 (83), 7 (89)
   - Allocation: [1, 2, 7]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (99), 3 (94)
   - Allocation: [5, 3]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 7 (86), 5 (60)
   - Allocation: [7] (Note: 7 is already taken, so considering next high: 4 (36))
   - Allocation: [4]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (71), 2 (62)
   - Allocation: [0]

Let's ensure all items are allocated and adjust if necessary:

- We have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, which totals 7 items. 
- Item 6 is unallocated, and Agent 2 has only 1 item allocated. 
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

Revised allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 2, 7]
- Agent 1: [5, 3]
- Agent 2: [4, 6]
- Agent 3: [0]

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0]
}
```
