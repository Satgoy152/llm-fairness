Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  95  95  69  33  99  23   5
1   9  48   5   3  72  15  57  99
2  93  98  52  65  11  73   7  10
3  88  78  57  96   1  27  49   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [88 78 57 96  1 27 49  3]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0 40  95  95  69  33  99  23   5
1  9  48   5   3  72  15  57  99
2 93  98  52  65  11  73   7  10
3 88  78  57  96   1  27  49   3
```

Let's try to distribute the items by considering each agent's highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 5, 1, and 2. Let's allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values item 7 the most. Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** highly values items 0 and 1, but item 1 is already assigned to Agent 0. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the most, followed by item 0, but item 0 is already allocated. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7. We have 3 more items to allocate: 4, 5, and 6.

- **Item 5** is most valued by Agent 0, but Agent 0 already has items. Agent 2 also values item 5 significantly. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

- **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 1. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

- **Item 6** is most valued by Agent 1 after item 4. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: Item 3

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3]
}
```
This allocation considers each agent's preferences and distributes the items in a manner that strives for fairness and reduces envy.
