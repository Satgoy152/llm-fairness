Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  44  12  34  87   6  33  72
1  60  36  42  51  14  15  34  30
2  84  18  87  67  96  91  39  24
3   7  44  51  25  41  50  88   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a way that aims for fairness and envy-freeness, we will consider the agents' valuations. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation compared to what others receive. While achieving envy-freeness can be complex with differing valuations, we will try to make allocations as fair as possible.

### Valuations Table

```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
-------------------------------------------
   0       | 70  44  12  34  87   6  33  72
   1       | 60  36  42  51  14  15  34  30
   2       | 84  18  87  67  96  91  39  24
   3       |  7  44  51  25  41  50  88   5
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 2**: They have the highest valuations for items 2 and 4 (87 and 96). To maximize their satisfaction and reduce envy, allocate these items to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 0**: They have the highest valuation for item 0 (70) and a significant valuation for item 7 (72). Allocate these items to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 3**: They have the highest valuation for item 6 (88). Allocate this item to Agent 3.

4. **Agent 1**: They have the highest valuation for item 3 (51) among their other choices. Allocate this item to Agent 1.

5. **Remaining Items**: Items 1 and 5 are left. 
   - Item 1 has high valuation by Agent 0 (44), but Agent 3 also values it at 44. Considering overall balance, allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Item 5 has a high valuation by Agent 3 (50), so allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocations

Let's ensure each agent receives at least one item where possible and fair distribution is maintained.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's total valuation while considering potential envy and fairness.
