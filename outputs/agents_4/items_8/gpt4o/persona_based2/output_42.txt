Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  34   2  82  17  16  44  60
1  55  90  97  89  81  31  86  13
2  75   6  67  83  93  62  90  25
3  25  84  42  15  65  96  83  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they would value any other agent's bundle. This is often challenging to achieve perfectly, but we can aim for a balanced allocation where each agent perceives their allocation to be fair.

First, let's consider the preferences of each agent:

- Agent 0: Prefers items with higher values such as 3, 0, 7
- Agent 1: Prefers items with higher values such as 2, 1, 3
- Agent 2: Prefers items with higher values such as 4, 6, 3
- Agent 3: Prefers items with higher values such as 5, 1, 6

Now, let's try to allocate the items, ensuring that each agent receives some of their preferred items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High preference for item 3 (82), item 0 (70), item 7 (60)
   - Allocate items: [3, 0]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High preference for item 2 (97), item 1 (90), item 3 (89)
   - Allocate items: [2, 1]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High preference for item 4 (93), item 6 (90), item 3 (83)
   - Allocate items: [4, 6]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High preference for item 5 (96), item 1 (84), item 6 (83)
   - Allocate items: [5, 7]

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated and no item is double-allocated:

- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (all items allocated).

Finally, here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's preferences while ensuring every item is allocated.
