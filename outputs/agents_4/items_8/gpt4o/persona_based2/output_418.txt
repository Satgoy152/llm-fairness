Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  53  12  52  92  32  42  21
1  42  35  46  32  97   3  65   3
2  82  81  95  43  30  11  25  61
3  75  70  25  67  84  71  42  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what any other agent received, according to their own valuations.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuations:

1. Agent 0 values items 4 (92), 1 (53), and 3 (52) the highest.
2. Agent 1 values items 4 (97), 6 (65), and 2 (46) the highest.
3. Agent 2 values items 2 (95), 0 (82), and 1 (81) the highest.
4. Agent 3 values items 4 (84), 7 (90), and 5 (71) the highest.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can assign items trying to maximize the highest preferences of each agent and ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [4, 1]  
  (Total valuation = 92 + 53 = 145)

- **Agent 1**: Items [6, 2]  
  (Total valuation = 65 + 46 = 111)

- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 3]  
  (Total valuation = 82 + 43 = 125)

- **Agent 3**: Items [5, 7]  
  (Total valuation = 71 + 90 = 161)

This allocation tries to balance each agent's preferences while ensuring all items are allocated. Each agent receives items that they value highly, which helps in achieving a fair distribution.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed among the agents.
