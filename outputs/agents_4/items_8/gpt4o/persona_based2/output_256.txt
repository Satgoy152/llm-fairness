Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  87  94   8  25  97  64  32
1  30  46  51  16  61  37  23  42
2  74  36  88  68  51  31  48  56
3   6  10  98  94  30   0  56  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to balance their share according to their preferences. We'll aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives a reasonable total valuation.

Let's analyze the valuations and make some allocations:

1. **Agent 0** values Item 5 the most (value 97), followed by Item 2 (94) and Item 1 (87). To maximize their satisfaction, we'll allocate these high-value items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** has a highest valuation for Item 4 (61), followed by Item 2 (51). Since Item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 to maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 2** values Item 0 the most (74), followed by Item 2 (88), which is again already allocated to Agent 0. Agent 2 also has a relatively high valuation for Item 6 (48). We'll allocate Item 0 and Item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for Item 3 (94) and Item 2 (98), but these items are already allocated. Agent 3 also values Item 7 (52) and Item 6 (56), but Item 6 is taken. We can allocate Item 3 and Item 7 to Agent 3.

Let's finalize the allocations making sure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: [5, 2]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0, 6]
- Agent 3: [3, 7, 1]

We will ensure all 8 items are allocated. Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 7, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations received by each agent according to their preferences, providing a fair division of items.
