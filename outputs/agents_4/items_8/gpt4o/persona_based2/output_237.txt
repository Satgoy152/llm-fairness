Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85   1  37  42  30  86  61  95
1  67  47  34  85  64  50  26  72
2  96   5  88  69  13  65  35  73
3  95  41   4   8  93  59  55  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the preferences of each agent and attempt to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

We'll use a heuristic approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Compute the total valuation of all items for each agent. This helps in understanding their overall preferences.
   
2. **Fair Share**: Each agent should ideally receive a total value close to one-fourth of their total valuation. This is based on the assumption that all items should be allocated equally in terms of value.

3. **Allocation Strategy**: Start by allocating the highest-valued item for each agent that hasn't been allocated yet, and then continue to allocate remaining items to balance the total valuation received among agents.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 7 the highest (95). Give item 7 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (85). Give item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest (96). Give item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 0 and item 4 equally (95 and 93 respectively), but item 0 is already allocated. Give item 4 to Agent 3.

Now we have:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [4]

Remaining items: 1, 2, 5, 6

Next, we continue allocating remaining items to balance the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Give item 5 (86) to Agent 0, as this is the next highest value available.
- **Agent 1**: Give item 1 (47) to Agent 1, as this is the next highest value available.
- **Agent 2**: Give item 2 (88) to Agent 2, as this is the next highest value available.
- **Agent 3**: The remaining item 6 (55) is allocated to Agent 3.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: [7, 5]
- Agent 1: [3, 1]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]
- Agent 3: [4, 6]

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value among agents, providing each with items they value highly.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
