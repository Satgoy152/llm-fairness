Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  33  34  25   8   8  35  20
1  42  24  92  63  49  29   5  85
2  90   5   3  15  21  49  14  58
3  21  81  40  76  88  31  96  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents based on their valuations, we need to consider a method that attempts to be envy-free and efficient. One approach to achieve this is the "Max-Min" method, which aims to maximize the minimum utility each agent receives. We can start by calculating the total value each agent places on all items and then allocate items in a manner that balances the perceived fairness.

Let's examine a potential allocation:

1. **Item-by-item allocation**: Allocate items one at a time to the agent who values them the most, ensuring every agent receives at least some value.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 90 (Agent 2)
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 81 (Agent 3)
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 92 (Agent 1)
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 76 (Agent 3)
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 88 (Agent 3)
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 49 (Agent 2)
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 96 (Agent 3)
- **Item 7**: Highest value is 85 (Agent 1)

After this initial allocation, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item and balance the allocations further. If any agent does not receive an item, we could adjust by reallocating some items where possible.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives no items initially. To include them, we can take an item from an agent who has multiple items and a lower value for that item. For example, Agent 3 has four items and Agent 0 could receive an item with a lower valuation for Agent 3.

Revising the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Take Item 1 from Agent 3 (Agent 3 values it at 81, while Agent 0 values it at 33, which is better than not having any item).

Now, ensure all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: [1]
- **Agent 1**: [2, 7]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 5]
- **Agent 3**: [3, 4, 6]

We can now present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible under the given constraints, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.
