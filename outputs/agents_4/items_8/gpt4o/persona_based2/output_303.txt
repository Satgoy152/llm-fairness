Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  30  11  18  46  61  52  61
1  48  96  90  88  43   7  62  48
2  90  48  90  57  93  62  16  28
3  19  37  98  72  85  83  26  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation as much as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuations.

Let's go through a potential allocation process:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent should ideally get 2 items since there are 8 items and 4 agents.
   - We will look for high valuation matches between agents and items while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

2. **Agent-Valuation Insights**:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 7.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 1, 2, and 3.
   - Agent 2 highly values items 0, 2, and 4.
   - Agent 3 highly values items 2, 4, and 5.

3. **Allocation**:
   - Allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring no overlap:

   - **Agent 0**:
     - Allocate items: 0, 1 (Values: 90, 30)

   - **Agent 1**:
     - Allocate items: 2, 3 (Values: 90, 88)

   - **Agent 2**:
     - Allocate items: 4, 5 (Values: 93, 62)

   - **Agent 3**:
     - Allocate items: 6, 7 (Values: 26, 83)

This allocation balances the total value distributed among agents while respecting their preferences as much as possible.

4. **Final Allocation**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated.
