Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  59  63  66  30  55  26  95
1  49  72  56  90  96  99  25  58
2  60  47  71  41   6   1   9  71
3  10  11  62  14  68   1   1   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items so that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We'll use a method that attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

We'll consider the following approach:

1. **Calculate total valuations for each agent**: Sum the valuations of all items for each agent to understand their overall preferences.
2. **Allocate items to balance valuations**: Try to distribute items so that each agent's total valuation is balanced, minimizing envy.

First, calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 30 + 59 + 63 + 66 + 30 + 55 + 26 + 95 = 424
- Agent 1: 49 + 72 + 56 + 90 + 96 + 99 + 25 + 58 = 545
- Agent 2: 60 + 47 + 71 + 41 + 6 + 1 + 9 + 71 = 306
- Agent 3: 10 + 11 + 62 + 14 + 68 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 172

The goal is to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as equal as possible. We can achieve this by assigning items one by one, considering the agent's preferences and their current total valuation.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 3]
  - Valuation: 30 (item 0) + 66 (item 3) = 96
- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 5, 6]
  - Valuation: 96 (item 4) + 99 (item 5) + 25 (item 6) = 220
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 7]
  - Valuation: 71 (item 2) + 71 (item 7) = 142
- **Agent 3**: Items [1]
  - Valuation: 11 (item 1) = 11

This allocation attempts to balance the relative satisfaction by considering the individual agent preferences and their total valuation.

Finally, here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items, with the distribution attempting to minimize envy among agents.
