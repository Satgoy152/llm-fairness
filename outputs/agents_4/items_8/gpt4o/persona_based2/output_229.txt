Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  25  43  46  15  77  45  40
1  69  77  95  55  31  59  55  82
2  52   6  60  42  51  18  57   7
3  52  62  66  75  18  92  87  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuation of the items. However, achieving strict envy-freeness in practice can be challenging, especially when the number of items is limited and must be distributed as whole units.

We will aim for an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives as much as possible, given their individual valuations. Here is a possible approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 12 + 25 + 43 + 46 + 15 + 77 + 45 + 40 = 303
   - Agent 1: 69 + 77 + 95 + 55 + 31 + 59 + 55 + 82 = 523
   - Agent 2: 52 + 6 + 60 + 42 + 51 + 18 + 57 + 7 = 293
   - Agent 3: 52 + 62 + 66 + 75 + 18 + 92 + 87 + 67 = 519

2. **Initial Assignment Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most to start the process. Then, adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

3. **Adjustments for Fair Distribution:**
   - Adjust allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item, and then balance the remaining items to approximate equal total value received by each agent.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items: 1, 5
  - Total value for Agent 0: 25 + 77 = 102

- **Agent 1** gets items: 2, 7
  - Total value for Agent 1: 95 + 82 = 177

- **Agent 2** gets items: 0, 6
  - Total value for Agent 2: 52 + 57 = 109

- **Agent 3** gets items: 3, 4
  - Total value for Agent 3: 75 + 18 = 93

This allocation aims to distribute the items such that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged compared to others, given their valuations. It may not be perfectly envy-free, but it balances the total value among the agents as evenly as possible.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
