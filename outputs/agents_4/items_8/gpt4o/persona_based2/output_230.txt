Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  59  78  18  20  62   7  24
1  64  50  59  99  59   6  61  38
2  54  61   1  71   7   9  64  68
3  95  26  25  97  91  45  29   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. One approach to achieve this is to use the Maximum Envy-Free Allocation method, although this might not always guarantee complete envy-freeness, especially when there are integer constraints on the number of items each agent can receive.

Let's try to allocate the items such that each agent receives a bundle they value highly, minimizing envy. Given the constraints, we must allocate exactly 8 items to 4 agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (87) and item 2 (78). We can assign these two items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 (99) the most. Assign this item to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 (68) the most. Assign this item to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values items 0 (95) and 3 (97) the most, but these are already assigned. The next best option is item 4 (91). Assign this item to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0** can also receive item 1 (59) to increase their total valuation.
6. **Agent 1** can receive item 5 (6) to add to their bundle.
7. **Agent 2** can receive item 6 (64) which they value second highest after item 7.
8. **Agent 3** can receive item 7 (1) despite its low value to them, as it's the only item left.

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation assigns all items and attempts to respect the preferences of each agent, though achieving complete envy-freeness under these conditions might not be possible.
