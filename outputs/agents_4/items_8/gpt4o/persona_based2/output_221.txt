Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  32  72   1  17  14  28  40
1  29  20  87  66  23  63  99  36
2   2  87  24  68  59   0  22  47
3  13  46  73  10  70  13  62  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a manner that aims for fairness and attempts to minimize envy, we can use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion. This approach ensures that any potential envy can be eliminated by removing at most one item from the envied agent's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve the allocation:

1. **Initial Assignment**: Assign each agent their most valued item, ensuring no item is assigned more than once. This helps reduce potential envy from the start.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Continue assigning the remaining items based on the next highest value for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjustment for Balance**: Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent ideally should get 2 items. Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets an equal or nearly equal number of items while maintaining as much value as possible.

4. **Final Allocation**: Ensure all items are allocated and adjust for potential envy by checking if any agent feels significantly disadvantaged.

Using these steps, let's allocate the items:

1. **Initial Assignment**:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (value 83)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (value 99)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (value 87)
   - Agent 3: Item 4 (value 70)

2. **Continue Allocation**:
   - Next highest value for Agent 0: Item 2 (value 72)
   - Next highest value for Agent 1: Item 5 (value 63)
   - Next highest value for Agent 2: Item 3 (value 68)
   - Next highest value for Agent 3: Item 7 (value 23)

3. **Check for Fairness**:
   - Each agent has 2 items, and the allocation is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - Ensuring that any potential envy is minimized, we can confirm the allocation is reasonably fair as each agent has received two items, balancing both quantity and value.

This allocation adheres to the EF1 criterion, aiming to minimize envy among the agents.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
