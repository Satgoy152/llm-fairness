Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  85  81  17  69  86   2  82
1  79   3  52  40  71  78   6  34
2  68  53  40  88  26  14  18  47
3   5  74   3  69  87  14  31  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. A common approach to achieve fairness, and in particular envy-freeness, is to use algorithms such as the adjusted winner or envy-free matchings. However, given the constraints and the need for simplicity, I will attempt to manually allocate the items in a way that seems fair based on the valuations.

Let's proceed with an approximate fair allocation based on the given values. I'll aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives items they value highly while trying to balance the overall allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 4 and 7.

Let's make a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 4, 6, and 7

Now, let's check if each agent receives items they value highly and if the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, and all 8 items are allocated.
