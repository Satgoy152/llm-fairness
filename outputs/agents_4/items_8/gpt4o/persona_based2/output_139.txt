Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  98  29  17  50  98  44  20
1  44  56  21  24  89  88  99  76
2  85  17  11  53  24  29  38  98
3  46  86  25  69  40  78  22  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that seeks to minimize envy and distribute the items according to valuations as evenly as possible. We'll attempt to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and the total value of items they receive.

Given the valuations, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 1, 5 (98) and 0 (82).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 6 (99) and 4 (89).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 0 (85) and 7 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 1 (86) and 5 (78).

We will allocate the items in a way that tries to give each agent a fair value based on their preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 (82) and 5 (98). Total valuation = 180.
- **Agent 1**: Items 6 (99) and 4 (89). Total valuation = 188.
- **Agent 2**: Items 7 (98) and 2 (11). Total valuation = 109.
- **Agent 3**: Items 1 (86) and 3 (69). Total valuation = 155.

This distribution aims to balance the total valuations each agent receives, reducing envy by ensuring no agent feels significantly undervalued compared to others.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
