Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  73  93  67  17  54  52  26
1  56  98  37  22  23  25  53  42
2  94  46  31  85  59  82  21  48
3  52  87  13  79  22  14  85  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution that considers the agents' preferences while attempting to achieve envy-freeness. 

Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Assess Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 473
   - Agent 1: 356
   - Agent 2: 466
   - Agent 3: 442

2. **Determine Average Value Per Item for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 59.125
   - Agent 1: 44.5
   - Agent 2: 58.25
   - Agent 3: 55.25

3. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations to reduce envy.

4. **Allocate the Items:**
   - Start by assigning the highest valued items according to each agent's preference.

**Allocations:**
- Agent 0:
  - Assign items: 0, 2 (values 93, 93)
  - Total value: 186

- Agent 1:
  - Assign items: 1, 6 (values 98, 53)
  - Total value: 151

- Agent 2:
  - Assign items: 5, 3 (values 82, 85)
  - Total value: 167

- Agent 3:
  - Assign items: 7, 4 (values 90, 22)
  - Total value: 112

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, with a focus on maximizing their individual valuations. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items among the agents, ensuring each receives items they value highly, which should mitigate envy.
