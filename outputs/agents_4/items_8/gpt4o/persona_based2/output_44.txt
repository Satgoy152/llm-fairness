Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  87  48  48  44   3  28  65
1  61  55  31  58   5  54  72  55
2   2  69  37  58  59   8  56  79
3  11  63  63  80   9  49  83  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the problem of fairly allocating items among agents such that envy-freeness is approached, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our objective is to distribute items so that each agent feels their allocation is fair compared to others, minimizing envy.

The given table of valuations is as follows:

```
        Items
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
Agents
0      31  87  48  48  44   3  28  65
1      61  55  31  58   5  54  72  55
2       2  69  37  58  59   8  56  79
3      11  63  63  80   9  49  83  35
```

**Strategy for Allocation:**
1. Each agent should receive at least one item.
2. Distribute items to maximize each agent's total valuation.
3. Attempt to ensure that no agent significantly envies another.

**Steps:**
- Calculate total valuation an agent gets from all items.
- Distribute items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation.

**Allocation:**
- Agent 0 highly values item 1, so assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 0, so assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 7, so assign item 7 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 6, so assign item 6 to agent 3.

Now, distribute the remaining items by examining the next highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's next highest value is item 7 (already taken), then item 2, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1's next highest value is item 3, so assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2's next highest value is item 4, so assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3's next highest value is item 3 (already taken), then item 5, so assign item 5 to agent 3.

Now, ensure all items are allocated:
- Item 0 to Agent 1
- Item 1 to Agent 0
- Item 2 to Agent 0
- Item 3 to Agent 1
- Item 4 to Agent 2
- Item 5 to Agent 3
- Item 6 to Agent 3
- Item 7 to Agent 2

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction and aims to remain as envy-free as possible given the constraints and nature of the valuations.
