Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  46  17   7   8  99  39  91
1  58  24  44  73  96  29  38  88
2  68   1  29  45  16  80   2  21
3  10  20  10  62  50  42  49  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we will aim for an envy-free solution where each agent feels satisfied with their share given their valuations. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

The table of valuations is as follows:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  46  17   7   8  99  39  91
1  58  24  44  73  96  29  38  88
2  68   1  29  45  16  80   2  21
3  10  20  10  62  50  42  49  96
```

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent would have for all items:

- Agent 0: 70 + 46 + 17 + 7 + 8 + 99 + 39 + 91 = 377
- Agent 1: 58 + 24 + 44 + 73 + 96 + 29 + 38 + 88 = 450
- Agent 2: 68 + 1 + 29 + 45 + 16 + 80 + 2 + 21 = 262
- Agent 3: 10 + 20 + 10 + 62 + 50 + 42 + 49 + 96 = 339

Based on these total valuations, we aim to allocate items to maximize the satisfaction of each agent according to their preferences. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 the most (99), followed by item 7 (91). We'll allocate these to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (96), followed by item 3 (73). We'll allocate these to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 5 highly (80), but since it's already taken, their next preferred items are item 0 (68) and item 3 (45). Item 0 is available, so we'll allocate it to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** values item 7 the most (96), but since it's already taken, their next preferred item is item 3 (62), which is also taken. We'll allocate item 6 (49), which is their next best available option.

5. Allocate the remaining items to minimize envy:
   - Agent 0 has items 5 and 7.
   - Agent 1 has items 4 and 3.
   - Agent 2 has item 0.
   - Agent 3 has item 6.
   - Remaining items: 1, 2.

Distribute remaining items:
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it at 46, which is more than any other agent.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 has fewer items and values it at 10.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuation preferences and attempts to minimize envy among agents.
