Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  14  55  79  16  48  76  98
1  98  82  60  36  21  51  10  27
2  46  21  28  85  45  11  43  88
3  73  12  35  94   0  92  21   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own given their respective valuations.

Here's a suggested allocation based on the table of valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Based on the valuations, Agent 0 values item 7 the most (98), followed by item 3 (79), and item 6 (76). We can allocate item 7 to Agent 0 since it has the highest value for them, and then possibly select another item that still leaves room for other agents to have high-value items.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 0 (98) and item 1 (82). We allocate item 0 to Agent 1 since it's the highest value, and item 1 can be allocated to another agent to maintain fairness.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most (85), followed by item 7 (88). Since item 7 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the most (94), but item 3 is already allocated. However, Agent 3 also values item 5 (92) and item 0 (73). Since item 0 is already allocated, we can allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

We will then review the remaining items and allocate them to balance the distribution:

- **Allocate remaining items**: Items 1, 2, 4, and 6 are left. We can allocate them based on the remaining highest valuations for each agent.

   - Agent 0 could take item 6 (76), which they value highly.
   - Agent 1 could take item 1 (82).
   - Agent 2 can take item 2 (28), which is their next highest valued remaining item.
   - Agent 3 can take item 4 (0), since other items are already allocated and this balances the number of items.

This allocation tries to keep the distribution fair based on the valuations provided.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```
