Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  70  81  25  89  52  45  60
1   1  54  82  45  79  66  57  75
2  90   4   0  88  60  74  31  38
3  66  23  40  55  12  86  73  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their valuations. We'll use the given valuation matrix to guide our allocation.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 97     | 70     | 81     | 25     | 89     | 52     | 45     | 60     |
| 1     | 1      | 54     | 82     | 45     | 79     | 66     | 57     | 75     |
| 2     | 90     | 4      | 0      | 88     | 60     | 74     | 31     | 38     |
| 3     | 66     | 23     | 40     | 55     | 12     | 86     | 73     | 30     |

Our goal is to allocate the items such that the total number of items allocated equals 8, and each agent receives an integer number of items. We will try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (97), Item 4 (89), Item 2 (81), Item 1 (70).
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (82), Item 4 (79), Item 7 (75).
   - Allocate items 2 and 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (90), Item 3 (88), Item 5 (74).
   - Allocate items 3 and 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (86), Item 6 (73), Item 0 (66).
   - Allocate items 1 and 6 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocations:

After ensuring no duplication and that all items are allocated, we arrive at the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they highly value, minimizing envy among agents based on their preferences.
