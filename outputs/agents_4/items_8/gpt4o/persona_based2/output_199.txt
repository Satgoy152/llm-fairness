Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  27  53   3  28  82  80  40
1   3   7   0  78  85  10   0  41
2   3  35  28  10  21  13  31  65
3  65  84  99  83  63  71  34  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [65 84 99 83 63 71 34 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that no agent envies another. We will aim to maximize each agent's total value while keeping the distribution balanced.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 6. We'll allocate items 0 and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the highest and has a significant valuation for item 3. We'll allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 7. We'll allocate items 1 and 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the highest and also has a good valuation for item 5. We'll allocate items 2 and 5 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and the distribution attempts to maximize individual valuations while minimizing envy.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
