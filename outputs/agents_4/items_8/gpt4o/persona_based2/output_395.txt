Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91   8  71  17  81  49  30  24
1  63  92  22  49  80  72  36  36
2  32   4  31  90  23  53  45  83
3  88  87  97  17  62  20  59   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [88 87 97 17 62 20 59  0]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for a distribution where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation, ideally achieving envy-freeness. However, given that there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent can be allocated 2 items to ensure everyone gets an integer number of items, but achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible in this scenario. Instead, we will try to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and try to balance it across agents.
2. Allocate items based on maximizing each agent's perceived value.

Given the valuations, the allocations might look like this:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value in item 0 (91) and item 4 (81).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value in item 1 (92) and item 5 (72).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value in item 3 (90) and item 7 (83).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value in item 2 (97) and item 6 (59).

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their own valuations, potentially reducing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```
