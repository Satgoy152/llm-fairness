Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  73  47   5  15  35  69  88
1  17  26  56  76  32  59  71  92
2  36  28  69  83  49  85  28  70
3  84  81  46   1  75   0  26  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to use the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division algorithms. However, given the small number of items and agents, we can also use a heuristic method to manually allocate the items in a way that attempts to minimize envy.

Let's begin by considering each agent's preference for each item based on their valuation. Our goal is to distribute the items to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 7 (88), Item 0 (74)
   - Agent 1: Item 7 (92), Item 3 (76)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (85), Item 3 (83)
   - Agent 3: Item 0 (84), Item 1 (81)

2. **Allocate the highest value items first, considering overlaps:**
   - Item 7 is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 1. Assign Item 7 to Agent 1, who has the highest valuation for it.
   - Item 0 is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 3, who has the highest valuation for it.
   - Item 3 is highly valued by both Agent 1 and Agent 2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2, who has the highest valuation for it.

3. **Allocate remaining items based on next highest valuations:**
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 2, since it is their second-highest preference.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as it is valuable to them and Agent 3 has already received a highly valued item.
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 1, as it is the next highest valued item available to them.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 3, as it is their next highest valued available item.
   - Assign the remaining Item 2 to Agent 0, as it balances the number of items each agent receives.

The final allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to distribute value fairly across agents.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation reflects an attempt to distribute items fairly based on the given valuations.
