Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  10  61  33  27  19  38  16
1  87  35  24  67  23  52   6  16
2  21  90  13  80  82  39  67  28
3  15  14  41   2  75  70  40  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution as much as possible. This means each agent should feel that their bundle of items is at least as good as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuations.

Let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 total value: \(35 + 10 + 61 + 33 + 27 + 19 + 38 + 16 = 239\)
- Agent 1 total value: \(87 + 35 + 24 + 67 + 23 + 52 + 6 + 16 = 310\)
- Agent 2 total value: \(21 + 90 + 13 + 80 + 82 + 39 + 67 + 28 = 420\)
- Agent 3 total value: \(15 + 14 + 41 + 2 + 75 + 70 + 40 + 80 = 337\)

Given these values, we should aim to distribute items such that agents receive items they value highly, while balancing the overall fairness.

To achieve the fairest distribution possible, let's consider the following allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items that Agent 0 values relatively highly compared to others, but also consider their total valuation weight.
   - Assign item 2 (value 61) and item 0 (value 35).

2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Assign item 3 (value 67) and item 5 (value 52).

3. **Agent 2**: Assign items that Agent 2 values highly.
   - Assign item 1 (value 90) and item 4 (value 82).

4. **Agent 3**: Assign remaining items that Agent 3 values decently.
   - Assign item 7 (value 80) and item 6 (value 40).

Now, we have distributed all 8 items across the agents. Here is the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [7, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's interests by giving them items they value relatively highly, thus promoting envy-freeness.
