Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  70  13  84  60  34  17  82
1  22  22  28  72  23  93  22  84
2  39  34  57   2  78  64  48  30
3  63  37  98  26  15  27  95  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method known as the "envy-free" allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent believes they received at least as much value as any other agent, based on their own valuations.

Given that we have 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. We will aim to allocate the items in such a way that minimizes envy.

Let's start by considering the agents' highest valuations and try to allocate items that maximize their satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (84), Item 7 (82)
   - Allocate items: 3, 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (93), Item 7 (84) - already allocated to Agent 0, next highest is Item 3 (72) - already allocated, next is Item 2 (28)
   - Allocate items: 5, 2

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (78), Item 5 (64) - already allocated, next highest is Item 6 (48)
   - Allocate items: 4, 6

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (98) - already allocated, next highest is Item 6 (95) - already allocated, next is Item 0 (63)
   - Allocate items: 0, 1

Now let's check the allocations and ensure each item is uniquely allocated, and each agent has two items:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 7
- Agent 1: Items 5, 2
- Agent 2: Items 4, 6
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1

Each agent has received 2 items, and all 8 items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
