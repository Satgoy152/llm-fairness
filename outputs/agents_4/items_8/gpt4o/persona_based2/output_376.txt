Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  97  74  35  38  40   4  22
1   6  68  69  14  53  67  83  65
2  56  34  23   1  35  45  52  40
3  50  23  96   2  72  31  45  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuation.

One way to achieve this is to use an algorithm like the "Adjusted Winner" or "Divide and Choose", but given the constraints of this problem (integer allocation), we need a simpler, practical approach.

Let's proceed with a manual allocation strategy that considers each agent's highest-valued items to try and minimize envy.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values items 0 and 1 the most. Allocate items 0 and 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values item 6 the most. Allocate item 6 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values item 6 highly, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 5. Allocate item 5 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values item 2 the most. Allocate item 2 to agent 3.

Now, we have the following allocations:

- Agent 0 has items: [0, 1]
- Agent 1 has items: [6]
- Agent 2 has items: [5]
- Agent 3 has items: [2]

We still have items 3, 4, and 7 unallocated. Let's distribute these:

5. **Remaining Items Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1 (since agent 1 values 3 higher than other remaining agents).
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 3 (agent 3 values item 4 higher than other remaining agents).
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 0 (as agent 0 values item 7 higher than other remaining agents).

### Final Allocation

This allocation aims to minimize envy by considering the highest value items for each agent and allocating remaining items based on relative preferences.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation intends to provide each agent with items they value highly and attempts to minimize envy by ensuring allocations are as balanced as possible given the constraints.
