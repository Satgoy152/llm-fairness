Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  53  26  68  80  70   5  63
1   0  72  37  60  25  30  75  34
2  12  74  44  70   7   6  35  70
3  64  39  82  40  55   5   8  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness and maximize the total utility for each agent given their valuations. This means trying to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own preferences.

One approach to achieve this is to use the "Round Robin" method, which allows each agent to sequentially pick their most preferred available item until all items have been allocated. We'll use this method to attempt an envy-free allocation.

Let's summarize the steps:

1. Determine the order of agents based on some criterion, such as a random order or their total valuation.
2. Agents take turns picking their highest-valued available item.
3. Repeat this process until all items have been allocated.

Using this method, let's go through the allocation process:

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0** picks item 4 (value 80).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 6 (value 75).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 3 (value 70).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 2 (value 82).

5. **Agent 0** picks item 7 (value 63).
6. **Agent 1** picks item 1 (value 72).
7. **Agent 2** picks item 5 (value 6).
8. **Agent 3** picks item 0 (value 64).

### Final Allocation

After completing the allocation process, each agent has received a set of items. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2, 0]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated two items, and the total number of items allocated is 8, satisfying the requirement.
