Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  65  74  27  67  92  93  46
1  37  37  26  44  89  99  79  62
2   7  23  62  30  63  22   9  90
3  53  14  22  63  53  97  21  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use an approach that ensures each agent receives an allocation they perceive as fair according to their valuations. Given the varying valuations, we'll aim to minimize envy by maximizing the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. 

The table of valuations is as follows:

| Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 77 | 65 | 74 | 27 | 67 | 92 | 93 | 46 |
| 1          | 37 | 37 | 26 | 44 | 89 | 99 | 79 | 62 |
| 2          | 7  | 23 | 62 | 30 | 63 | 22 | 9  | 90 |
| 3          | 53 | 14 | 22 | 63 | 53 | 97 | 21 | 90 |

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High Valuation Items**: First, identify items that have high valuations for particular agents to ensure they get valuable allocations.
2. **Distribute Items**: Assign items in a manner that each agent gets at least one high-value item, if possible.

### Allocation Steps

- **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 5 (92) and 6 (93). Assign these items to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for item 5 (99) and item 4 (89). Since item 5 is already assigned, assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Has high valuation for item 7 (90). Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Has high valuation for item 5 (97) and item 7 (90). Since these are already assigned, assign item 3 (63) to Agent 3.

At this point, we have assigned a few high-value items. We continue assigning remaining items:
- Agent 0: Already has two items (5, 6). Assign item 0 (77) to further strengthen their allocation.
- Agent 1: Already has one item (4). Assign item 1 (37) to them.
- Agent 2: Already has one item (7). Assign item 2 (62) to them.
- Agent 3: Already has one item (3). Assign item 1 (14) to them.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items that maximize their overall satisfaction, given their individual valuations.
