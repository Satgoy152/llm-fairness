Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  83  64  65  45  97  35  88
1  22  35  82  76   7  19  86  31
2   9  49  51  84   1  29  49   5
3  36  60  19   8  97  46  80  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for envy-freeness, ensuring that each agent prefers their own allocation over that of any other agent. Given the constraints—each agent receiving an integer number of items and all 8 items being allocated—let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to minimize envy.

Let's consider the valuations provided and allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while attempting to balance overall envy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 2 and 6.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most.
4. **Agent 3** values items 4 and 6 highly, but we aim to reduce overlap with Agent 1.

Allocating items based on these high preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 6
- **Agent 2**: Item 3
- **Agent 3**: Items 4, 5

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives while distributing the items evenly:

- Agent 0 receives items with a total valuation of 79 + 83 + 88 = 250.
- Agent 1 receives items with a total valuation of 82 + 86 = 168.
- Agent 2 receives an item with a valuation of 84.
- Agent 3 receives items with a total valuation of 97 + 46 = 143.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some of their highest-valued items, aiming for a fair and envy-free distribution.
