Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  25  93  34  29  42  45  34
1  85   0   3  83  61   1   3  27
2  50  16  84  96  68  82  41  51
3  57  21  11  29  61  28  91  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. We will aim to maximize the total valuation received by each agent for the items they are allocated, ensuring a fair distribution across all agents.

Let's look at the valuations for each item and determine a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: 
  - Highest valuations: Item 2 (93), Item 5 (42), Item 6 (45)
- Agent 1: 
  - Highest valuations: Item 0 (85), Item 3 (83)
- Agent 2:
  - Highest valuations: Item 3 (96), Item 5 (82), Item 6 (41)
- Agent 3:
  - Highest valuations: Item 6 (91), Item 4 (61)

We aim to balance allocations while considering high-value interests:

1. **Agent 0:** Allocate items 2 and 6, which are among their highest values.
2. **Agent 1:** Allocate items 0 and 3, which are among their highest values.
3. **Agent 2:** Allocate items 5 and 7, which are among their high values.
4. **Agent 3:** Allocate items 1 and 4, which are among their high values.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets 2 items, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This distribution aims to ensure each agent receives items that are valuable to them while distributing the total items fairly.
