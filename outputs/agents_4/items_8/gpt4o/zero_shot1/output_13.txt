Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  73   2  51  28  77  31  25
1  66  75  80  36  33  48  41  63
2  63  10  80   7  33  35  72  75
3   9  61  45  98  13  72  27  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 73  2 51 28 77 31 25]
 [66 75 80 36 33 48 41 63]
 [63 10 80  7 33 35 72 75]
 [ 9 61 45 98 13 72 27 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize or balance these valuations among them. Given that we have 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 items to ensure fairness in quantity. We also want to try to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive based on the given valuations.

Let's break down a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 77.
   - The next highest valued item for Agent 0 is 1 at 73.
   - Allocate items 5 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 80.
   - The next highest valued item for Agent 1 is 1 at 75, but it's already taken by Agent 0. The next option is item 0 at 66.
   - Allocate items 2 and 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 80, but it's already allocated to Agent 1. Next is item 7 at 75.
   - The next highest valued item for Agent 2 after 7 is 6 at 72.
   - Allocate items 7 and 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 98.
   - The next highest valued item for Agent 3 is 7 at 79, but it's already allocated to Agent 2. The next option is item 5 at 72, but it's already allocated to Agent 0. The next available highest value is item 1 at 61.
   - Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 3.

With this strategy, each agent receives two items, and the allocation is done based on maximizing their respective valuations as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
