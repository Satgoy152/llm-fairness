Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27   3  40   7  13  59  60  50
1  41  45  94   3  46   6  66  61
2  50  58   4  22  45   4  40  93
3  94  34  88  61  94  74  53  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations. One approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible, given the constraints). 

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a reasonably fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Allocations**: Look for unique high-value allocations where an agent values an item significantly more than others, which can ensure high satisfaction for that agent.

2. **Ensure Coverage**: Attempt to allocate at least one item per agent, if feasible, given the item constraints.

3. **Balance the Allocation**: Distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation across agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly (59), but agent 3 values item 5 more (74). We'll allocate item 5 to agent 3.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 (94), so we'll allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 highly (93), so we'll allocate item 7 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly (94), so we'll allocate item 0 to agent 3.
- For the remaining items, we consider the next highest values:
  - Agent 0 values item 6 (60), so we'll allocate item 6 to agent 0.
  - Agent 1 values item 1 (45), so we'll allocate item 1 to agent 1.
  - Agent 2 values item 4 (45), so we'll allocate item 4 to agent 2.
  - Agent 3 values item 3 (61), so we'll allocate item 3 to agent 3.

This ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations while distributing all items.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences while distributing all items.
