Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  78   6  32  16  41  57  63
1  94  89  47  37  53  62  26  20
2  82  44  25  21  91  44  70  16
3   5  25   5   3  95  66  25  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the total value of the items as evenly as possible among all agents. We'll consider each agent's valuation and try to balance the total value they receive.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 79 + 78 + 6 + 32 + 16 + 41 + 57 + 63 = 372
- Agent 1: 94 + 89 + 47 + 37 + 53 + 62 + 26 + 20 = 428
- Agent 2: 82 + 44 + 25 + 21 + 91 + 44 + 70 + 16 = 393
- Agent 3: 5 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 95 + 66 + 25 + 34 = 258

Now let's fairly allocate the items by trying to balance the total value received by each agent:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 3 (value 95) because it has the highest value for agent 3 and helps balance the value distribution.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 78) because it is highly valued by agent 0.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 94) as it is highly valued by agent 1.
4. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 70) as it is highly valued by agent 2.
5. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 66) to balance the allocation further.
6. Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value 63) as it is highly valued by agent 0.
7. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 47) to balance the allocation further.
8. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 21) to balance the allocation further.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 7 (total value: 78 + 63 = 141)
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2 (total value: 94 + 47 = 141)
- Agent 2: Items 6 and 3 (total value: 70 + 21 = 91)
- Agent 3: Items 4 and 5 (total value: 95 + 66 = 161)

This allocation attempts to distribute the value of the items as evenly as possible among the agents. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
