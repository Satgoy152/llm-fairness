Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  18  54  95  75  93  17  62
1  90  71   9  14  99  61  23  27
2  40  85  44  20  11  71  28  61
3  12  80  88  83  62   4  97  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [89, 18, 54, 95, 75, 93, 17, 62]
   - Highest valuations are for items 3, 5, and 0. Choose items 3 and 5.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [90, 71, 9, 14, 99, 61, 23, 27]
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 and 0. Choose items 4 and 0.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [40, 85, 44, 20, 11, 71, 28, 61]
   - Highest valuations are for items 1, 5, and 7. Choose items 1 and 7.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: [12, 80, 88, 83, 62, 4, 97, 32]
   - Highest valuations are for items 6 and 2. Choose items 6 and 2.

With this allocation, each agent receives two items, and all items are distributed. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations for each agent while ensuring fairness in the distribution of items.
