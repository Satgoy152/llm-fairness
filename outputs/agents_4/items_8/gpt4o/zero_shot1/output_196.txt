Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  21  61  61  60   2  78  91
1  41  29  40  79  34  94  88  10
2   8  65  92  23  79  23   7  29
3   0  69   0  77  73  43  46  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to distribute the 8 items such that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

The goal of a fair allocation is typically to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share. One common approach is to use a method like the "maximum sum" or "egalitarian" allocation, where we attempt to maximize the minimum satisfaction among all agents.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0 are 7 (91), 6 (78), 2 (61), and 3 (61).
   - We can allocate item 7 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for this agent.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 1 are 5 (94), 3 (79), 6 (88), and 0 (41).
   - We can allocate item 5 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for this agent.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 2 are 2 (92), 4 (79), 1 (65), and 7 (29).
   - We can allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for this agent.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 3 are 7 (80), 4 (73), 3 (77), and 1 (69).
   - We can allocate item 3 to Agent 3, as it has a high value for this agent.

Now we have allocated 4 items, and each agent has received one item. We need to allocate the remaining 4 items fairly among the agents.

5. **Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (second highest value they have for an unallocated item).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (high value for this agent and it's unallocated).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (second highest value they have for an unallocated item).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (one of the remaining unallocated items).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

Each agent now has 2 items, which matches the total of 8 items.
