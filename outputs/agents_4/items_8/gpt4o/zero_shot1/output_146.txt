Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  83  52  33  82   2  22  54
1  63  40  35  63  90  15  83  35
2  89  48  28  51  68  81   4   7
3  34  81  18  28   1   6   1  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences while also maintaining an integer allocation. Let's analyze the values and try to distribute the items such that each agent's total value is as balanced as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Items with high value are 1 (83), 4 (82), and 7 (54).
2. **Agent 1**: Items with high value are 4 (90), 0 (63), and 3 (63).
3. **Agent 2**: Items with high value are 0 (89), 5 (81), and 4 (68).
4. **Agent 3**: Items with high value are 1 (81), 7 (38), and 0 (34).

Let's allocate the items with a balance between the agents' preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 4 (high-value items for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 0 and 3 (high-value items for Agent 1).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 5 and 2 (high-value items for Agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 7 and 6 (remaining high-value items for Agent 3).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [7, 6]
}
```
