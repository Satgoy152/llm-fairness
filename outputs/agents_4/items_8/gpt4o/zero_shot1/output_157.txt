Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  89  57  97  93  83   0  57
1   0  50  84  50  28  76  41  45
2  14  14  93  27  17  82  15  49
3   0  99  90  88  79  62  88  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 50 84 50 28 76 41 45]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one way to do it:

1. Start by identifying the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, by selecting items that maximize their individual valuations.
3. Allocate any remaining items by considering the next highest valuations for each agent.

After analyzing the valuation table, here is a potential fair allocation:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 2 and 5.
- Agent 2 has a high value for item 2, but since agent 1 is already allocated item 2, we can consider item 5 or another suitable item.
- Agent 3 has high values for items 1 and 3.

Given these observations, a fair allocation might look like this:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1, 6

Now, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent gets an integer number of items.
