Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  72  89  78  61  74  43  31
1  83  52  89  24  40  69  72  44
2  78  55  15  60  17  68  76  58
3  57  15  60  28  70  37   9   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items based on their preferences while balancing the distribution of items. Since there are 4 agents and 8 items, ideally, each agent should receive 2 items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the valuations, the highest values for Agent 0 are for items 2 (89) and 0 (79).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations are for items 2 (89) and 0 (83), but item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is item 5 (69).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations are for items 6 (76) and 5 (68), but item 5 is allocated to Agent 1. The next highest is item 7 (58).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuations are for items 4 (70) and 2 (60), but item 2 is allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is item 3 (28).

Considering the above preferences:

- **Agent 0** gets items [2, 0].
- **Agent 1** gets items [5, 1].
- **Agent 2** gets items [6, 7].
- **Agent 3** gets items [4, 3].

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [4, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets 2 items (which is fair since there are 8 items and 4 agents) and respects the highest valuations as much as possible.
