Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  94   7  89  93  14  65  42
1  43  68  35  98  16   6  61  32
2  96   7   0  70   6  58  99  74
3  91  89  93  31  96  49  56  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to aim for a balanced distribution where each agent gets items that they value highly.

Let's go through a possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (94), Item 4 (93), Item 3 (89)
   - Allocate Item 1 and Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (98), Item 0 (43)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (99), Item 0 (96)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (96), Item 0 (91)
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 5 to Agent 3.

After these allocations, we have the following items distributed: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. We have two items left to allocate: Items 2 and 7.

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 2 has low values for all agents, but Agent 3 might benefit from it more because it has the highest value for them among the agents.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.

6. **Final Item Allocation**:
   - Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 2 among the remaining agents.
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 2.

Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, while distributing the items fairly across the agents.
