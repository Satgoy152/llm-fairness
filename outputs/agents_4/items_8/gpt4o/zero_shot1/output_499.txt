Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  99  42  58  54  72  98  44
1  30  53  80  83  51  42  18   5
2  80  52  79  11  91  65  69  28
3  61  88   4  96  46  76  36  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 1, and 6 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 2 and 3 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 4 and 5 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly, but since item 3 is already taken by Agent 1, we can assign other items based on remaining high values.

Considering these preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 6.
- Agent 1: Assign items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2: Assign items 4 and 5.
- Agent 3: Assign items 1 and 7.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value relatively highly.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
