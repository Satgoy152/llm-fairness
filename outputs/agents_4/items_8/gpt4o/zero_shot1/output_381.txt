Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  27  64  94  98  52  72  58
1  89  40  86  58  67  87   7  66
2  58  45  44  64  69  76  87  70
3  20  46  97  60  21  28  20  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations for items: 4 (98), 3 (94), 6 (72), 2 (64)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations for items: 0 (89), 5 (87), 2 (86), 4 (67) 

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations for items: 6 (87), 5 (76), 7 (70), 4 (69)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations for items: 2 (97), 1 (46), 3 (60)

Considering the highest valuations and aiming for each agent to get at least one item if possible, we can attempt the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [0, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [6, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 2]

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they highly value while ensuring every item is allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
