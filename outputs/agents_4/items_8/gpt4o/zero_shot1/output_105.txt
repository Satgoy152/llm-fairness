Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  52  56  65  79  43  45  28
1  29  66   0  62  47   0  46  36
2  21  25  23  50  99  34  71  80
3  50  99  69  66  50  68   1  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents while maximizing their valuation and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can look for a balanced distribution according to the given valuations.

Let's consider each agent's highest-valued items and distribute them accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has relatively high values for items 4 and 3. We can allocate these items to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest value for item 1. We can allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a very high value for item 4, but as it is already allocated, we'll allocate item 7, which is their next highest value.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent has the highest value for item 1, but it's already allocated. The next highest value is item 5. We'll allocate item 5 to agent 3.

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Already has items 3 and 4.
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 is allocated.
- **Agent 2**: Item 7 is allocated.
- **Agent 3**: Item 5 is allocated.

Now, allocate the remaining items (0, 2, 6):

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0 (highest value for item 0 among all agents).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6 (next highest remaining valuation).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 (remaining item).

Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 0],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their total individual valuations based on the provided data.
