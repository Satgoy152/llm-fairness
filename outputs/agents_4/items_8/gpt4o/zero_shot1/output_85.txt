Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  17  73  19  62  31  20  39
1  74  72  65  99  64  33  73  69
2   3  76  22  58  85  41  53  87
3   8  19  81   7  96  36  46  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item. Below is the allocation based on this strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is 92 for item 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value is 99 for item 3.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is 87 for item 7.
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value is 96 for item 4.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 3.

Now, allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest values:

5. **Remaining for Agent 0**:
   - Next highest value is 73 for item 2.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

6. **Remaining for Agent 1**:
   - Next highest value is 74 for item 0, but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest unallocated is 73 for item 6.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 1.

7. **Remaining for Agent 2**:
   - Next highest value is 85 for item 4, but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest unallocated is 76 for item 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

8. **Remaining for Agent 3**:
   - Next highest value is 81 for item 2, but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest unallocated is 36 for item 5.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 3.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7, 1],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
