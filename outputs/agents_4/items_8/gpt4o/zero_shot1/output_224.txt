Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  20  79  82  19   0  36  66
1  70  49  26  82  66   5  88  65
2  69   5  96   7  46  23  39   5
3   0  93  43  72  17  28  39  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation of the items they receive is as balanced as possible. We will also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and in total, all 8 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [56, 20, 79, 82, 19, 0, 36, 66]
- Agent 1's valuations: [70, 49, 26, 82, 66, 5, 88, 65]
- Agent 2's valuations: [69, 5, 96, 7, 46, 23, 39, 5]
- Agent 3's valuations: [0, 93, 43, 72, 17, 28, 39, 54]

We will attempt a fair allocation considering both the number of items and the total valuation each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 2 (79) and 3 (82).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 0 (70) and 6 (88).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for items 2 (96) and 0 (69), but item 2 is already taken by Agent 0.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuations are for items 1 (93) and 3 (72), but item 3 is already taken by Agent 0.

Based on this, let's propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 and 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 and 6
- **Agent 2**: Items 4 and 5
- **Agent 3**: Items 1 and 7

Now, let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
