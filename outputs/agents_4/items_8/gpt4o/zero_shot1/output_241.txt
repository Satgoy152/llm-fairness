Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  35  20   9  47  71  94  82
1  90  38  14  67   4  99  19   4
2  66  30  44  18   8   1  96  46
3  41  81  52  44  85  30  44  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to do this:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 6, and 7.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 5.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 6.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1, 4, and 7.

After analyzing the valuations, we aim to distribute the items to maximize fairness in the value received by each agent:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 4, 7]
}
```
