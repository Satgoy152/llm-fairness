Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  44  84  44  49  64  53  75
1   4  63   5  55  50  37  81  65
2  57  33  83  28   4  43  98  19
3  88  32  31  58  38  76  50  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations. Let's try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

First, let's consider each agent's total valuation for all items and try to allocate items to balance the total value each agent receives.

### Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 0 + 44 + 84 + 44 + 49 + 64 + 53 + 75 = 413
- Agent 1: 4 + 63 + 5 + 55 + 50 + 37 + 81 + 65 = 360
- Agent 2: 57 + 33 + 83 + 28 + 4 + 43 + 98 + 19 = 365
- Agent 3: 88 + 32 + 31 + 58 + 38 + 76 + 50 + 49 = 422

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Each agent should ideally receive items such that their total valuation of the received items is as balanced as possible.
2. The number of items each agent receives should be either 2 or 3 since there are 8 items and 4 agents.

Let's distribute the items:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (84), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly (81), so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly (98) but item 6 is already allocated, so allocate item 0 (57) to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly (88), but item 0 is allocated. The next highest for Agent 3 is item 5 (76), so allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now we have:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [5]

Remaining items: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7

Allocate remaining items to balance the total valuation:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (44).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (55).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (4).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 (49).

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [2, 1]
- Agent 1: [6, 3]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]
- Agent 3: [5, 7]

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
