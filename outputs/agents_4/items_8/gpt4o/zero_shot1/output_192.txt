Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  70  12  31  48  47  63  30
1  97  50  43  32  17  29  85  55
2   5  30  14  88  21  73  90  84
3  27  97  95  78  38  20  82  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that reflects their preferences and valuations. A common approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [84, 70, 12, 31, 48, 47, 63, 30]
Agent 1: [97, 50, 43, 32, 17, 29, 85, 55]
Agent 2: [5, 30, 14, 88, 21, 73, 90, 84]
Agent 3: [27, 97, 95, 78, 38, 20, 82, 71]
```

To maximize fairness and total satisfaction, we can use a greedy allocation approach where each agent is assigned the item for which they have the highest remaining valuation, ensuring that each item is allocated only once.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (97). Assign item 0 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 1 (97). Assign item 1 to agent 3.
3. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 2 (95). Assign item 2 to agent 3.
4. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (88). Assign item 3 to agent 2.
5. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 4 (48). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
6. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5 (73). Assign item 5 to agent 2.
7. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6 (90). Assign item 6 to agent 2.
8. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 7 (84). Assign item 7 to agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 5, 6, 7],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing all 8 items.
