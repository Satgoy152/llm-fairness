Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  58  77  99  62  57  21  48
1   3  15  78  54  94  62   9   5
2  44  18  91  52  65  11  40  80
3  11  20  12  62  52  88  42  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 15 78 54 94 62  9  5]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and that all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values items 3 and 2 highest. Allocating these items gives them a total value of 99 + 77 = 176.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the highest, with a value of 94.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 the highest, but since itâ€™s already allocated, the next highest is item 7 with a value of 80.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5 the highest with a value of 88.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0, 1, and 6:

- Item 0: Assigned to Agent 2 with a value of 44.
- Item 1: Assigned to Agent 0 with a value of 58.
- Item 6: Assigned to Agent 3 with a value of 42.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7, 0],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
