Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  59  39  76  29  60  18  96
1  69  33  22  91  97   7  86   9
2  20  63  72  61  64  22   7  28
3  47  11  46  31  76  91   0  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize overall satisfaction. One method is to allocate items by trying to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. 

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (96), Item 3 (76)
   - Assign Item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (97), Item 3 (91)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (72), Item 4 (64)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (91), Item 4 (76)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 3.

At this point, each agent has received one item. Now we continue assigning the remaining items:

5. **Remaining Items**: 0, 1, 3, 6

   - **Agent 0**: Next highest valuation is Item 3 (76).
   - **Agent 1**: Next highest valuation is Item 3 (91).
   - **Agent 2**: Next highest valuation is Item 3 (61).
   - **Agent 3**: Next highest valuation is Item 4 (76).

   Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.

6. **Remaining Items**: 0, 1, 6

   - **Agent 0**: Next highest is Item 0 (66).
   - **Agent 1**: Next highest is Item 0 (69).
   - **Agent 2**: Next highest is Item 1 (63).
   - **Agent 3**: Next highest is Item 0 (47).

   Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.

7. **Remaining Items**: 1, 6

   - **Agent 0**: Next highest is Item 1 (59).
   - **Agent 1**: Next highest is Item 6 (86).
   - **Agent 2**: Next highest is Item 1 (63).
   - **Agent 3**: Next highest is Item 6 (0).

   Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.

8. **Remaining Items**: 6

   - **Agent 0**: Item 6 (18)
   - **Agent 1**: Item 6 (86)
   - **Agent 2**: Item 6 (7)
   - **Agent 3**: Item 6 (0)

   Assign Item 6 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4, 3, 0, 6],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution is based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations.
