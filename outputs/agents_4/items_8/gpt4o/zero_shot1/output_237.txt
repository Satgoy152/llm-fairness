Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  12  58  10  15  41   4  66
1  18  45  44  61  82  17   3  79
2  90  28  27  24  47  58  97  16
3  80  53  63  39  45   7  39  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction or utility. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated in total.

One approach to achieve this is to consider each agent's highest-valued items and allocate based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [34, 12, 58, 10, 15, 41, 4, 66]
- Agent 1: [18, 45, 44, 61, 82, 17, 3, 79]
- Agent 2: [90, 28, 27, 24, 47, 58, 97, 16]
- Agent 3: [80, 53, 63, 39, 45, 7, 39, 37]

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 6 (97), so we assign item 6 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (82), so we assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** also highly values item 0 (90), so we assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a high value for item 0, but it's already allocated to Agent 2. Next, Agent 3 values item 2 (63), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 0** highly values item 7 (66), so we assign item 7 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** highly values item 7, but it is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest value is item 3 (61), so we assign item 3 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 0** values item 2, which is already taken. The next highest is item 5 (41), so we assign item 5 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 3** highly values item 0 and 2, which are already assigned. The next highest is item 1 (53), so we assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, let's verify that each agent has an integer number of items and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 5
- Agent 1: Items 4, 3
- Agent 2: Items 6, 0
- Agent 3: Items 2, 1

Each agent has exactly 2 items, and all 8 items are allocated. Let's express this allocation in the requested JSON format.

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their individual satisfaction based on their valuations.
