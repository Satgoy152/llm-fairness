Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  60  92  69  63  14   7  36
1  89  30  32  91  21  58  12  20
2  60  75  41  52  28  70  63  96
3  86  88  90  65  51  47   1  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest valuations:** Start by looking at the highest values in each row to ensure each agent gets at least one preferred item.

2. **Assign initial items based on highest values:**
   - Agent 0: The highest value is for item 2 (92).
   - Agent 1: The highest value is for item 3 (91).
   - Agent 2: The highest value is for item 7 (96).
   - Agent 3: The highest value is for item 1 (88).

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - With four items already allocated, we need to distribute the remaining four items (0, 4, 5, 6).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (89) since it’s their second-highest preference and one of the highest remaining values.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (70) as it is their second-highest preference among the remaining items.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (51) as it is their highest preference among the remaining items.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (7) since Agent 0 has no other items, and this completes the allocation.

4. **Check allocations for fairness:** Ensure each agent has at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the fair allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.
