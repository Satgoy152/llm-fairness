Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  39  83  21  63   2  28   5
1  64  69  97  50   2  21  74  59
2  34  83  80  66  36   0  60  14
3  45  58  20  81  64  27   7  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One simple approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 64.
   
2. Item 1:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 83.
   
3. Item 2:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
   
4. Item 3:
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 81.
   
5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 63.
   
6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 2.
   
7. Item 6:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 74.
   
8. Item 7:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 59.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 6, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, no items are left unallocated, and the allocation is based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive.
