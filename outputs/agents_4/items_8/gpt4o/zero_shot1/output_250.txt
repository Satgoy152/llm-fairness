Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  41   1  56  47   3  44  93
1   1  14  57   1  63  20  24  21
2  49  64  18  31  31  47  54  38
3  42  61  41  35  57  62  74  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Identify Preferences**: Look at each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate those first.

2. **Ensure Distribution**: Ensure all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item where possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Make adjustments to ensure fairness, such as redistributing items if one agent has a significantly higher total valuation than others.

Based on the valuations given, here's one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 7.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2.
- Agent 2 has relatively flat valuations, but item 1 is highest.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 5, 6, and 3.

Taking these into account, here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly where possible and all items are distributed among the agents.
