Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  98  18  84  71   0  27  76
1  29  90   5  20  20  75  59  98
2  64  17  44  14  55  35  64  24
3  12  32  93  97  55  20   6  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 98 18 84 71  0 27 76]
 [29 90  5 20 20 75 59 98]

 [12 32 93 97 55 20  6 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction or value. Here is one way to allocate the items based on the given table:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (98), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (98), so assign item 7 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 and item 6 equally (64), so we can assign item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (97), so assign item 3 to agent 3.

Now we have items 2, 4, 5, and 6 still unallocated. Let's continue with allocation:

- Agent 2 also values item 6 highly (64), so assign item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 highly (93), so assign item 2 to agent 3.
- Agent 0 values item 4 next highest (71), so assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly (75), so assign item 5 to agent 1.

The allocations can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.
