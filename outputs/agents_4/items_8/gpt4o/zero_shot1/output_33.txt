Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  44  20  18  75  81  69  11
1  43  35  42   2  67  53  58  40
2  18  17  24   2  61   7   8   5
3  99  49  52  62  70  89  73  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while distributing all 8 items among the 4 agents. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the highest value for each item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Assign items to agents based on highest valuation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Ensure fair distribution**: Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally get 2 items. We may need to adjust allocations to ensure each agent gets a fair share.

4. **Optimization**: If any agent gets more than 2 items, redistribute items to agents with fewer allocations, ensuring that we still aim to keep the allocation value high.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most (99).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (44).
- **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the most (52).
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most (62).
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most (75).
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most (81).
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most (73).
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most (11).

Initial allocation based on highest valuation:

- Agent 0: [1, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0, 2, 3, 6]

**Redistribution for fairness:**

- Move Item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it second highest, 35).
- Move Item 7 from Agent 0 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it second highest, 5).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [4, 5]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [7]
- Agent 3: [0, 2, 3, 6]

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
