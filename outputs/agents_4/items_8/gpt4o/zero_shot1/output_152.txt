Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  27  81   0  27  96  44  74
1  37   9  40  44  41  34  38  70
2  15  19  59  20  62  75  36  54
3  87  72  39  48  74  56   1  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Sort Items by Highest Value Per Agent**: 
   - Identify the agent who values each item the most.
   - Allocate the item to that agent if they have not reached their fair share of items.

2. **Allocate Items**:
   - Each agent should ideally receive 2 items since there are 8 items and 4 agents. However, due to the integer constraint, some agents might receive more or fewer items, but it should balance out to the total.

3. **Balancing**: 
   - Ensure that all items are allocated and that the distribution remains as fair as possible.

Following this process, here's the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations on items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations on items 3 and 7.
- Agent 2 has high valuations on items 4 and 6.
- Agent 3 has high valuations on items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they highly value, while also distributing the items fairly across all agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly and that all items are distributed among the agents.
