Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  54  64  66  71  38  17  71
1  45  56  59  47  12  22  46  33
2  46  25  73  18   5  29  86   8
3  10  69  80  39   4  90  26  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach. One common method is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item until all items are allocated. Keeping fairness in mind, we'll attempt to balance the number of items each agent receives and try to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Let's start by allocating the items:

1. Prioritize giving each agent at least one item, based on their highest valuation.
2. Then, allocate remaining items to maximize total value for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (84). Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (59). Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6 (86). Allocate item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5 (90). Allocate item 5 to agent 3.

Now, each agent has one item. Let's allocate the remaining items based on remaining valuations:

- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 7 (92). Allocate item 7 to agent 3.
- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 4 (71). Allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1 (56). Allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 3 (18). Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

Now, all items have been allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

Each agent received 2 items, ensuring a balanced and fair allocation while maximizing the total valuation for each agent.
