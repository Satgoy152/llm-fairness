Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  16  34  29  77  19  58  70
1   3  40  46  21  85  33  31  74
2  56   0  86  12  56  74  45  42
3  95  51  19  92  59  81  46  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a relatively balanced distribution of value based on their preferences, while also ensuring all items are distributed. Given the constraint of integer allocations, I will distribute the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prefers item 4 (value 77), item 7 (value 70), and item 6 (value 58).
   - Allocation: Items 4, 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prefers item 4 (value 85), item 7 (value 74), and item 2 (value 46).
   - Allocation: Item 2

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Prefers item 2 (value 86), item 5 (value 74), and item 0 (value 56).
   - Allocation: Items 5

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Prefers item 0 (value 95), item 3 (value 92), and item 5 (value 81).
   - Allocation: Items 0, 1, 3, 6

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1, 3, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a fair share of items relative to their valuations, and all 8 items are distributed.
