Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  47  23  90  12  86  33  27
1  14  81  33  47  29  55  70  98
2  82  12   2  94  16  85  54  84
3  92  88  81  35  57  76   1  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will analyze the values and attempt to distribute the items in a way that leads to a balanced allocation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with highest values: 3 (90), 5 (86)
   - Allocate: Items 3 and 5

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items with highest values: 7 (98), 1 (81)
   - Allocate: Items 7 and 1

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items with highest values: 0 (82), 3 (94), 5 (85), 7 (84)
   - Since items 3, 5, and 7 are already taken, 
   - Allocate: Item 0

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items with highest values: 0 (92), 1 (88), 2 (81)
   - Since item 0 and 1 are already taken, 
   - Allocate: Items 2, 4, and 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair allocation based on their preferences while all items are distributed.

The final fair allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
