Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  93   8  37  61  39  71  99
1  76  97  42  21  94  18  52  49
2  38  64  46  54  49  92  64  76
3  40  25  17  12  31  20  37  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total value for each agent or distribute the items to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences. Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (99).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (97).
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (92).
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the highest (83), but item 7 is already taken, so we look at their next highest value, item 0 (40).

After ensuring each agent gets an item they value highly, we can distribute the remaining items considering the agents' next highest preferences:

- Remaining items: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Agent 0: Highest remaining value is item 6 (71).
- Agent 1: Highest remaining value is item 4 (94).
- Agent 2: Highest remaining value is item 6 (64), but item 6 is already taken, so item 4 (49) is next.
- Agent 3: Highest remaining value is item 2 (17).

Let's finalize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 5, 2
- Agent 3: Items 0, 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
