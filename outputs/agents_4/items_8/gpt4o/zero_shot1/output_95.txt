Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26   7  74  52  77  30  77  91
1  36  52  36  64  10  36  89  14
2  95  27   8  93  63  71  86  72
3   4  31  28  63  29  96  14  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. The challenge is to distribute the items such that the allocation is as balanced and fair as possible.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Start by identifying the highest value each agent assigns to any item and try to allocate those items to those agents first.

2. **Assign Remaining Items:** Distribute the remaining items to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and try to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- **Agent 0's highest value** is item 7 with a value of 91. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1's highest value** is item 6 with a value of 89. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2's highest value** is item 0 with a value of 95. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3's highest value** is item 5 with a value of 96. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and we have 4 items left (1, 2, 3, 4).

- **Assign remaining items:**
  - Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it has a high value (64) for them.
  - Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it has a high value (77) for them.
  - Assign item 1 to Agent 3, since it has a moderate value (31) for them.
  - Assign item 2 to Agent 0, since it has a moderate value (74) for them.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the distribution attempts to balance the valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4, 2],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation is based on balancing the highest valuations and distributing the remaining items fairly among the agents.
