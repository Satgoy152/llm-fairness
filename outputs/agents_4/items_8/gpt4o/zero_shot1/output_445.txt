Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  48  30  65  37  99  93  29
1  91  90  23  49  82  68  29  57
2  26  32  18  24  56  25  20  74
3   7  77  31  49  47  96  85  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuation of the items. An effective way to do this is to use a round-robin method or a greedy strategy where each agent gets the item they value the most in turn until all items are allocated.

Here is one approach to fairly allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Start by assigning the item with the highest individual value for each agent.
3. Continue assigning the remaining items in a way that balances the total value received by each agent.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Agent 0: Values are [65, 48, 30, 65, 37, 99, 93, 29]. Highest value: 99 (item 5)
2. Agent 1: Values are [91, 90, 23, 49, 82, 68, 29, 57]. Highest value: 91 (item 0)
3. Agent 2: Values are [26, 32, 18, 24, 56, 25, 20, 74]. Highest value: 74 (item 7)
4. Agent 3: Values are [7, 77, 31, 49, 47, 96, 85, 31]. Highest value: 96 (item 5, but already taken)

Since item 5 is already taken by Agent 0, Agent 3 takes their next highest value, which is 85 (item 6).

Continuing with the allocation:

- Remaining items: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Agent 0 takes item 3 (value: 65)
- Agent 1 takes item 1 (value: 90)
- Agent 2 takes item 4 (value: 56)
- Remaining item 2 is assigned to Agent 3 (value: 31)

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [7, 4]
- Agent 3: Items [6, 2]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the total value available based on their preferences.
