Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  32  30  53  75  55   7  10
1  69  44  49  14  57  19  59  92
2  99  30  72   9  99  90  93  61
3  83  35  73  75   8  27   0  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most with a valuation of 99.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it the most with a valuation of 32.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 3 values it the most with a valuation of 73.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 3 values it the most with a valuation of 75.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it the most with a valuation of 75.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 2 values it the most with a valuation of 90.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 2 values it the most with a valuation of 93.

8. Item 7:
   - Agent 1 values it the most with a valuation of 92.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 5, 6],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items to maximize their individual valuations.
