Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76   0  24  57  55  16  41  88
1  12  56  58  54  88  17  61  62
2  68  69  74  32  41  34  34  84
3  31  30  90  78  70  55  49  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. The challenge also requires us to ensure that all items are allocated, and the allocation should be as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 7 (88), Item 0 (76)
   - Allocate: Items 7, 0

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (88), Item 2 (58)
   - Allocate: Items 4, 2

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (74), Item 7 (84) - Item 7 already taken, next highest is Item 1 (69)
   - Allocate: Items 1, 6

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (90) - Item 2 already taken
   - Next highest available: Item 3 (78), Item 5 (55)
   - Allocate: Items 3, 5

Now, let's verify that all items are allocated and each agent has a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 5]

All 8 items are allocated, and each agent receives 2 items. The allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
