Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  93  32  29  71  95  96  98
1  28  12  61  84  61  67  85   9
2  10  52  92  59  11  14  57  12
3  98  94  21  64  89  36  96   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a systematic approach to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 5, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 3, 6, and 4.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 6.

We should allocate items in such a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible).

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0** gets items 5 and 7.
- **Agent 1** gets items 3 and 4.
- **Agent 2** gets items 2 and 1.
- **Agent 3** gets items 0 and 6.

This allocation respects each agent's high valuations while distributing all items fairly. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents effectively.
