Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  14  91  90  24  36  36  89
1  28  33  25  45   1  78  87  21
2  63  77  14  77  73  72  52  10
3  99  64  73  56  94  67  52  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since we have 4 agents and 8 items, ideally each agent would receive 2 items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would receive if they were allocated 2 items, and try to maximize that value.
2. Assign items based on these calculated values while ensuring each agent ends up with exactly 2 items.

Let's begin the allocation process:

### Step 1: Assign Items to Agent 0
Agent 0 values items 2 and 3 the most:
- Item 2: Value = 91
- Item 3: Value = 90

### Step 2: Assign Items to Agent 1
Agent 1 values items 5 and 6 the most:
- Item 5: Value = 78
- Item 6: Value = 87

### Step 3: Assign Items to Agent 2
Agent 2 values items 1 and 3 the most, but item 3 is already taken. Next best are:
- Item 1: Value = 77
- Item 0: Value = 63

### Step 4: Assign Items to Agent 3
Agent 3 values items 0 and 4 the most, but item 0 is already taken. Next best are:
- Item 4: Value = 94
- Item 7: Value = 81

Now, let's provide the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives exactly 2 items, and the total number of allocated items is 8, as required.
