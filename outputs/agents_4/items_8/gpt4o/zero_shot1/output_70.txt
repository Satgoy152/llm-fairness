Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75   3  18  30   3  36  70  19
1  65  80  21   2  36  53  10  27
2  17  83  89  50  46  37  43   8
3  96  18  83  32  55   0  60  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 80 21  2 36 53 10 27]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to aim for an allocation that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for agent 0 is for item 0 (75). So, allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for agent 1 is for item 1 (80). So, allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for agent 2 is for item 2 (89). So, allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for agent 3 is for item 0 (96), but it is already taken. The next highest is item 2 (83), but it's also taken. The next is item 4 (55). So, allocate item 4 to agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 3, 5, 6, and 7:

5. **Agent 0**: Next highest available valuation is item 6 (70). Allocate item 6 to agent 0.
6. **Agent 1**: Next highest available valuation is item 5 (53). Allocate item 5 to agent 1.
7. **Agent 2**: Next highest available valuation is item 3 (50). Allocate item 3 to agent 2.
8. **Agent 3**: The only item left is item 7, allocate item 7 to agent 3.

So the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated fairly based on the valuations provided.
