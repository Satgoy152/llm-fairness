Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  63  74  66  41  62  52  83
1  30  72  79  98  78  39  22  94
2  12  19  99  33  79  89  71  26
3  97  80  25  85  73  41  36  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their preferences. A possible approach is to assign items in such a way that each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their individual satisfaction without exceeding the total number of items available.

Let's analyze and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: item 7 (83), item 2 (74)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: item 3 (98), item 7 (94)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: item 2 (99), item 5 (89)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: item 0 (97), item 1 (80)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items, ensuring each agent has at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8:

- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (second highest valuation).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation after Agent 2's top items are allocated).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation after item 7).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
``` 

Each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.
