Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  23  62  79   5  97  93   0
1  70  54  26  56  97  44   5  33
2  41  32  53  11  46  62  10   2
3  87  60  78  62  24  91  36  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, considering each agent's preferences. We'll also ensure that each agent receives at least one item, while keeping the distribution balanced.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are items 5 and 6 with values 97 and 93, respectively.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value items for Agent 1 are items 4 and 0 with values 97 and 70, respectively.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value items for Agent 2 are items 5 and 2 with values 62 and 53, respectively. Since item 5 is already allocated, we'll consider item 2 and then item 1 with a value of 32.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value items for Agent 3 are items 0 and 5 with values 87 and 91, respectively. Since item 0 may be allocated to Agent 1, we'll consider item 3 with a value of 62 and item 7 with a value of 32.

To ensure all items are allocated and the allocation is fair, let's adjust as needed:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 5 and 6.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 4 and 0.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 2 and 1.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 3 and 7.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

Each agent has received two items, ensuring a balanced and fair allocation based on the valuations provided.
