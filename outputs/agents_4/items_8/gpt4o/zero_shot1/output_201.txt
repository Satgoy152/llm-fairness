Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  99  47  44  55  22  79  95
1  94  42  88  15  40  13  15  93
2  68  17  46  24  23   6  44  60
3  25  24  86  21  67  56  48  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's attempt to allocate items by considering the highest valuations first, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and no more than 8 items in total are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation items: 1 (99), 7 (95)
   - Allocate item 1

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation items: 0 (94), 7 (93)
   - Allocate item 0

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation items: 0 (68), 7 (60)
   - Allocate item 7

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation items: 2 (86), 7 (80)
   - Allocate item 2

Now, each agent has at least one item, and we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate 4 more items.

5. Allocate remaining items based on next highest valuations and ensuring a fair distribution:
   - Agent 0: Allocate item 6 (79)
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 4 (40)
   - Agent 2: Allocate item 3 (24)
   - Agent 3: Allocate item 5 (56)

Now, each agent has received a fair share based on their valuations, and all 8 items have been allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
