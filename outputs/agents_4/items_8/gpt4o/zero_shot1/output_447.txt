Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  64  21  93  74  88  60  58
1  16  52  69   3  28  87  44  11
2  75  34  83  83  64  13  50  49
3  61  72  44  65  26  42  63  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We must also ensure that all 8 items are allocated.

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 3: 93 (highest value for agent 0)
   - Item 5: 88

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2: 69
   - Item 6: 44

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0: 75
   - Item 4: 64

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 1: 72
   - Item 7: 73

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and the total number of items distributed is 8. Each agent receives items they value relatively highly, maximizing overall satisfaction under these constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
