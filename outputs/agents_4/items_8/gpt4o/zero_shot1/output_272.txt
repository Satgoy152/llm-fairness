Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  94  25  64  11   3  99  97
1  65  85  37  50  51  34  91  92
2  61  21  77  59  93   7   9  16
3  62  74  65   0  52  86  14   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a somewhat balanced share according to their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** For each agent, identify the item with the highest value to them.
2. **Assign Based on Preferences:** Start by assigning each agent one of the items they value highly, ensuring no conflicts.
3. **Balance Remaining Items:** Distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation each agent receives as evenly as possible.

**Agent Preferences:**

- Agent 0: Highest value is item 6 (99)
- Agent 1: Highest value is item 0 (65)
- Agent 2: Highest value is item 4 (93)
- Agent 3: Highest value is item 5 (86)

**Initial Allocation Based on Highest Values:**

- Agent 0 gets item 6
- Agent 1 gets item 0
- Agent 2 gets item 4
- Agent 3 gets item 5

**Remaining Items:** 1, 2, 3, 7

**Distribute Remaining Items:**

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (second highest value, 97)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest value, 85)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (second highest value, 77)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (second highest value, 0, but needed for balance)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences and tries to balance the overall valuations.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and no conflicts arise, with all 8 items being allocated.
