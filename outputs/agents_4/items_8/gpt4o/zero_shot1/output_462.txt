Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1   9  63  61  41   5  94  58
1  98  37  33  21  88  48  50  16
2  63  77   3  95  51  47  73  17
3  97  32  69  85  89  29  75  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1  9 63 61 41  5 94 58]
 [98 37 33 21 88 48 50 16]

 [97 32 69 85 89 29 75 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives an approximately equal value of items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Preferences (highest to lowest): 6 (94), 2 (63), 3 (61), 7 (58), 4 (41), 1 (9), 5 (5), 0 (1)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Preferences: 0 (98), 4 (88), 5 (48), 6 (50), 1 (37), 3 (21), 7 (16), 2 (33)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Preferences: 3 (95), 1 (77), 6 (73), 0 (63), 4 (51), 5 (47), 7 (17), 2 (3)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Preferences: 0 (97), 4 (89), 3 (85), 6 (75), 2 (69), 7 (38), 1 (32), 5 (29)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, let's ensure a fair allocation by considering remaining items and the current distribution:

- Remaining Items: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Remaining Agents to Allocate: All agents

Continuing with the next items:

1. **Agent 0**: Already has item 6. Let's try to equalize the value:
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Already has item 0. Next best available item:
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Already has item 3. Next best available item:
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Already has item 4. Next best available item:
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

Now all items are allocated. Let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```
