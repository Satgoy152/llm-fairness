Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57   2  50  41   9  33  67  87
1  33  85  52  44  25  35  73  68
2  44  30   3  62  21  12  84  20
3  23   7  77  32  87  66  57  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. The problem can be approached by maximizing the sum of valuations while respecting the constraints.

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Evaluate the Total Valuation**: First, calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each item. This is an important factor when considering who might value a particular item the most.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: A simple greedy approach might be to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, but this doesn't ensure a fair distribution in terms of the number of items each agent receives.

3. **Balance the Allocation**: To ensure fairness, we need to balance the allocation so that each agent gets at least some items, if possible. Given we have 4 agents and 8 items, ideally, each agent should receive 2 items.

4. **Iterate and Assign**: Begin assigning items to agents based on their valuations, ensuring that no agent receives more than 2 items (given the total number of items and agents).

Following these steps, let's create a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (87), so assign item 7 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (85), so assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (84), so assign item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most (87), so assign item 4 to agent 3.

Now each agent has 1 item. Let's allocate the remaining 4 items:

- Check remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 5.

- Agent 0 also values item 0 highly (57), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 also values item 2 highly (52), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 also values item 3 highly (62), so assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 also values item 5 highly (66), so assign item 5 to agent 3.

Now each agent has 2 items, and all 8 items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
