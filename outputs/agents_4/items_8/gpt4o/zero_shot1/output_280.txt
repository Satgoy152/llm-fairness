Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  41  25  20  31  79  77  72
1   1  51  72  19  35  90  36  15
2  51  79  61  88  82  74  55  84
3  14   6  46  73  29  86  47  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize each agent's individual satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. A common approach is to allocate items to the agents with the highest valuations for those items, ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5, 6, and 7.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 5.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 7.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5.

Given these observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable amount of value based on their preferences.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items amongst the 4 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
