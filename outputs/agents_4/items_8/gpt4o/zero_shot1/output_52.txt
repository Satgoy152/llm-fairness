Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  58  13  20  47  47  78  67
1   5   4  22  33  10  94  40  36
2  12  18  50  65  99  80  50  84
3  65  16  12  60  88  51  76  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[20 58 13 20 47 47 78 67]
 [ 5  4 22 33 10 94 40 36]
 [12 18 50 65 99 80 50 84]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1: Value 58
   - Item 5: Value 47

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: Value 33
   - Item 6: Value 40

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4: Value 99
   - Item 7: Value 84

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 0: Value 65
   - Item 2: Value 12

This allocation tries to balance the valuations among the agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
