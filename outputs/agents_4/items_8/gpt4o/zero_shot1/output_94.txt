Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  22  73  97  29  79  21  20
1  46  94  66  12   8  70  21  89
2  27  34  47  98  94   8  51  76
3  41  60  60  89  95   4  87  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Assign High-Value Items**: Start by assigning items to agents who value them the most.
2. **Balance Remaining Items**: After assigning high-value items, distribute the remaining items to balance the allocation.

Let's begin the allocation process:

- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (97). Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (94). Assign item 1 to agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (95). Assign item 4 to agent 3.
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 values item 7 the most (89). Assign item 7 to agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (73). Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (79). Assign item 5 to agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (87). Assign item 6 to agent 3.
- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (46). Assign item 0 to agent 1.

After assigning based on maximum valuations, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 2, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 7.
- Agent 2 receives no items.
- Agent 3 receives items 4 and 6.

This allocation distributes all 8 items and attempts to maximize the valuation for each agent based on the given table.
