Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26   5  61  33  76  66  93   4
1  40  77   8  69  56  22  61  90
2  37  29  55   4  35  19  99  34
3  57   7  60  65  58  26  27  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed.

Let's start by evaluating the highest valuations for each agent and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: 
     - Item 6: 93
     - Item 4: 76
     - Item 5: 66
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: 
     - Item 1: 77
     - Item 7: 90
     - Item 3: 69
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: 
     - Item 6: 99
     - Item 2: 55
     - Item 0: 37
   - Since Item 6 is already taken, allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: 
     - Item 7: 94
     - Item 0: 57
     - Item 3: 65
   - Since Item 7 is already taken, allocate Item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Agent 0 receives one more item: Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation).
- Agent 1 receives one more item: Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation).
- Agent 2 receives one more item: Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (second-highest valuation).
- Agent 3 receives one more item: Allocate Item 0 to Agent 3 (second-highest valuation).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed fairly based on the given valuations.
