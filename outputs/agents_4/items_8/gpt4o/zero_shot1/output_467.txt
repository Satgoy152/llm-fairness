Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  12  12   6  46  11  64  57
1  50  35  78  61  72  45  56   9
2   5  19  11  38   5  14  74  18
3  87  61  89  31  66  99   1  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High Valuation Items:** Look for items where the valuation is significantly higher for specific agents. These items should preferably be allocated to those agents.

2. **Distribute Items:** Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and try to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

3. **Optimize Allocation:** Adjust allocations to maximize the total valuation while keeping the distribution fair.

Let's consider the allocation with these steps:

### Allocation Proposal:

#### Step-by-Step Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** 
  - High Valuation: Item 6 (64), Item 0 (53)
  - Allocate Item 6 and Item 0 to Agent 0

- **Agent 1:**
  - High Valuation: Item 2 (78), Item 4 (72)
  - Allocate Item 2 and Item 4 to Agent 1

- **Agent 2:**
  - High Valuation: Item 6 (74) is already taken by Agent 0. 
  - Allocate Item 3 (38) to Agent 2

- **Agent 3:**
  - High Valuation: Item 5 (99)
  - Allocate Item 5 and Item 7 (77) to Agent 3

#### Resulting Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [5, 7]

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items while trying to maximize the valuation for their allocated items.
