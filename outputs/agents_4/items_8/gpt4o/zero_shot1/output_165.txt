Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  90  98  46  98  27  58  36
1   9  57  44  86  36  66  70   1
2  61  38  13  79  35  20   5  92
3  32  93  54  87  98   8  12  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents while maximizing their individual valuations, we can utilize a simple greedy approach. We will assign items to the agents based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 52
   - Agent 1 values it at 9
   - Agent 2 values it at 61
   - Agent 3 values it at 32
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 90
   - Agent 1 values it at 57
   - Agent 2 values it at 38
   - Agent 3 values it at 93
   - Allocate to Agent 3 (highest value)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 98
   - Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Agent 2 values it at 13
   - Agent 3 values it at 54
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value)

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 46
   - Agent 1 values it at 86
   - Agent 2 values it at 79
   - Agent 3 values it at 87
   - Allocate to Agent 3 (highest value)

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 98
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Agent 2 values it at 35
   - Agent 3 values it at 98
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (tie, but Agent 0 gets it as they have fewer items)

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 27
   - Agent 1 values it at 66
   - Agent 2 values it at 20
   - Agent 3 values it at 8
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value)

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 70
   - Agent 2 values it at 5
   - Agent 3 values it at 12
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value)

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 36
   - Agent 1 values it at 1
   - Agent 2 values it at 92
   - Agent 3 values it at 36
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value)

After this allocation, each agent should have received a fair number of items, trying to maximize their individual valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while considering the highest valuations by each agent where possible.
