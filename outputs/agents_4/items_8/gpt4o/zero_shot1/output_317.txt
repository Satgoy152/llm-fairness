Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23   1  95  25   7  17  50  51
1  88  33  53   5  28  66  10  33
2   9  46  33  92  94  25   9  39
3  86  60  84   3  83  15  65  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value item for each agent.
2. Assign that item to the respective agent.
3. Repeat the process, avoiding conflicts, until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the steps:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: 95 for item 2
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: 88 for item 0
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: 94 for item 4
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: 86 for item 0 (already assigned)
   - Next highest value: 84 for item 2 (already assigned)
   - Next highest value: 83 for item 4 (already assigned)
   - Next highest value: 65 for item 6
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining items**: 1, 3, 5, 7
   - **Agent 0**: Next highest item value is 51 for item 7
     - Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 1**: Next highest item value is 66 for item 5
     - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - **Agent 2**: Next highest item value is 46 for item 1
     - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
   - **Agent 3**: Next highest item value is 23 for item 3
     - Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now we have allocated all 8 items:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair distribution of items based on their valuations while all items are allocated.
