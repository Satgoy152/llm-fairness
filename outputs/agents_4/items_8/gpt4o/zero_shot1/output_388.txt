Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  32  32  56  27  32  42  38
1  18  28  79  34  99   9  11  40
2   8  99   2  14  61  90  99  54
3  10  22  58  91  26  87  58  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Consider each agent's preferences and assign items to maximize total satisfaction.
2. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.
3. Try to balance the allocation to ensure fairness.

Below is a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 has relatively balanced values but doesn't have high values for any specific item.
- Agent 1 highly values items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 highly values items 1, 5, 6.
- Agent 3 highly values item 3.

Based on this analysis, one potential allocation could be:

- Assign item 2 and item 4 to Agent 1 (high value for both).
- Assign item 1, item 5, and item 6 to Agent 2 (high value for these).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (high value for this).
- Assign items 0 and 7 to Agent 0 to balance remaining allocations.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 6],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This way, each agent gets a fair share of items, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
