Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  51  66  72  56  54  76   0
1  35  62  81  30  66  75  15  21
2  43  88  23  91  26  11  51   9
3  93  92  18  35   5  44   4  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 51 66 72 56 54 76  0]
 [35 62 81 30 66 75 15 21]
 [43 88 23 91 26 11 51  9]
 [93 92 18 35  5 44  4 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. List all items.
2. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, respecting that each agent should ideally have at least one item.

After analyzing the valuations given, here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 0 and 6 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 2 and 5 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 1 and 3 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 4 and 7 highly.

Now, let's translate this into the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, maximizing their preferences based on the given valuations.
