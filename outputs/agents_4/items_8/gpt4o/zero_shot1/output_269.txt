Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  52   2  46  35  29  15  81
1  97  79  32  64  26  31  36  12
2  53  64  90  73  87  35  57  62
3  73   8  97   4  68  72  45  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 52  2 46 35 29 15 81]
 [97 79 32 64 26 31 36 12]
 [53 64 90 73 87 35 57 62]
 [73  8 97  4 68 72 45 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation based on the values provided:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 7 (81), followed by item 1 (52), and item 3 (46).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 0 (97), followed by item 3 (64).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 2 (90), followed by item 4 (87).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 2 (97), followed by item 7 (80).

Let's consider a distribution that attempts to balance the allocations based on these high-value items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value: 97).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value: 52).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (value: 90).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 64).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value: 87).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 (value: 72).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 (value: 45).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (value: 81).

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items, considering their valuations, and all items are distributed.
