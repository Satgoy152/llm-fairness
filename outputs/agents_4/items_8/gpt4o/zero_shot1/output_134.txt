Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  84  72  28  67   2  27  16
1  25  98  36  11  45  63  28  95
2  58  42  82   5  96  41  99  19
3  41  10  13  21  14  67  29  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, a common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 and item 7 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 highly.
4. Agent 3 does not have any standout high-value items compared to other agents.

I'll aim to distribute items such that each agent receives approximately equal total value, considering their preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Now, I'll present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations.
