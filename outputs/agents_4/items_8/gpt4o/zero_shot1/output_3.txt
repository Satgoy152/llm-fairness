Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  29  30  74  73  33  76  40
1  32  22  84   0  74  95  87  35
2  96  97  69  64  31  96  70  73
3  42  62  82  83   5  35  64   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. Given that each agent should receive a whole number of items and the total number of items is 8, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 6 (value 76)
   - Item 3 (value 74)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 5 (value 95)
   - Item 2 (value 84)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0 (value 96)
   - Item 1 (value 97)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 4 (value 5)
   - Item 7 (value 1)

This allocation gives each agent 2 items, and the selection is based on the highest values possible for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
