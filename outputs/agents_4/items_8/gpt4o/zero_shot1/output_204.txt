Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  40  94  45  79  96  12  69
1  11  68  70  21  71  37  54  12
2  42  36  23  95  26  72  62  86
3  23  81  90  12  71   6  23  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 68 70 21 71 37 54 12]

 [23 81 90 12 71  6 23 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. We aim to distribute the 8 items in a manner that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 and 7.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.

We must balance these valuations to ensure fairness. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 could receive items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 could receive items 4 and 6.
- Agent 2 could receive items 3 and 7.
- Agent 3 could receive items 1 and 2.

This allocation considers each agentâ€™s highest valued items while ensuring every agent gets an integer number of items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
