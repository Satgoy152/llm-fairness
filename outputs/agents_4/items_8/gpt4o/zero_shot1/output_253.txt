Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  30  87  71  81  84  86   1
1  73  33  55  30  90  70   5  54
2   5  80  90  10  89  21  78  28
3  59  46  80  53   4  18  35  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share of items. One common approach is to use a variation of the "Greedy Round-Robin" algorithm, where we start by assigning the most valued item to an agent and continue until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Identify each agent's highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Allocate each agent one item in a round-robin fashion based on their preferences, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Following this approach, here is one possible allocation for the given table:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value 87).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (value 90).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value 90). Since item 2 is already taken by agent 0, we assign their second highest, which is item 1 (value 80).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (value 80). Since item 2 is already taken by agent 0, we assign their second highest, which is item 0 (value 59).

Continuing this process, we assign the remaining items:

- Agent 0 takes item 5 (value 84).
- Agent 1 takes item 6 (value 5).
- Agent 2 takes item 3 (value 10).
- Agent 3 takes item 7 (value 23).

This allocation ensures a fair distribution based on the preferences and values given by each agent.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```
