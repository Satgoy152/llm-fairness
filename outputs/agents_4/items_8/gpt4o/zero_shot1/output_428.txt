Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  76  31  57  38  37  18  34
1  31  15  85  84  64  69  20  24
2  18  98  71  57  86  47  32  43
3  91  49  67  42  62  99  98  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent ends up with a reasonable share based on their valuations. Given the table, one approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (91).
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (98).
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (85).
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (84).
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (86).
- **Item 5**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (99).
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (98).
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (43).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, by adjusting some allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Originally has no items. Swap item 3 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0's valuation of item 3 is 57, which is relatively high).
- **Agent 1**: After swapping item 3, retains item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Retains items 1, 4, and 7.
- **Agent 3**: Retains items 0, 5, and 6.

Now, the allocations ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated remains 8. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4, 7],
    "3": [0, 5, 6]
}
```
