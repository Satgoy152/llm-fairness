Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  45  29  96  89  13  91  92
1  67  38  17  16  24  68  36  23
2  68  28  52  43  84  22  46  90
3   4  92  39  11  54  81  82  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to use a strategy that considers both the individual valuations of items and overall fairness.

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: They have high valuations for items 3, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Has relatively lower valuations, but they might benefit from items like 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 0 and 7.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a high valuation for item 1.

Let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (96 valuation).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (68 valuation).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (92 valuation).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (92 valuation).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (91 valuation).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (68 valuation).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (84 valuation).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (39 valuation).

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of high-value items among agents while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, optimizing for the highest valuations where possible.
