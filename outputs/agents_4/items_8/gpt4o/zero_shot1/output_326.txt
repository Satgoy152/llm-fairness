Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  42  75  25  27  17   0  46
1  74  63  10   0  73   8  79  94
2  32  59  95  31  48  42  39  33
3   8  40  51  56  48  20  18  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize their total satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent will receive 2 items to maintain fairness and balance.

Let's evaluate how to allocate the items by considering the highest preferences for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (75) and 1 (42).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 7 (94) and 6 (79).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (95) and 1 (59). However, item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest preferences are for items 5 (42) and 4 (48).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 3 (56) and 2 (51). However, item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest preference is item 4 (48).

Now, considering the constraints and preferences, we can distribute the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 1].
- Agent 1 receives items [7, 6].
- Agent 2 receives items [5, 4].
- Agent 3 receives items [3, 0].

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```
