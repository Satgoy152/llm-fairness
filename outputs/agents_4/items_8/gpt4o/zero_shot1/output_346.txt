Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  64   7  11  78  60  18  70
1  51  13  93  92  46  39  11  53
2  81  28  32  61  36  66  12  85
3  10  96  16  46  42  22  74  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for a distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed. Let's go through the process:

1. Start by considering each agent's top preference and try to allocate that item if it hasn't already been allocated.
2. Continue allocating items based on the next highest preference that hasn't been allocated yet.
3. Ensure that each agent receives approximately the same number of items, taking into account the constraint of integer allocation.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 4 (value 78).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 2 (value 93).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 0 (value 81).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 1 (value 96).

After allocating these top preferences, the remaining items are 3, 5, 6, and 7. We distribute these to balance the number of items each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives item 6 (value 18).
- Agent 1 receives item 3 (value 92).
- Agent 2 receives item 5 (value 66).
- Agent 3 receives item 7 (value 93).

Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and each item is distributed to maximize the agents' preferences while keeping the allocation fair.
