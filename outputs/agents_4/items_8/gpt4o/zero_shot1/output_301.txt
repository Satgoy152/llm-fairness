Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  81   4  84  96  50  10  99
1  11   4  78  72  35  35  71  35
2  95  94  77  83  84  33  25  15
3  20  64  69  50  58  25  73  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is 8. We will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: 7 (99), 4 (96), 3 (84)
   - Allocate items: 7, 4

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 2 (78), 3 (72)
   - Allocate item: 2

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 0 (95), 1 (94), 3 (83)
   - Allocate items: 0, 1, 3

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 7 (91), 6 (73)
   - Allocate items: 5, 6

Now, let's check the allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives items: 7, 4
- **Agent 1** receives item: 2
- **Agent 2** receives items: 0, 1, 3
- **Agent 3** receives items: 5, 6

Let's present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 3],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
