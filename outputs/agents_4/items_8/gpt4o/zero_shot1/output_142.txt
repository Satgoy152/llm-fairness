Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  97  42  41  13  53  29  68
1  37  84  53  40  96  76   2  84
2  91  44  68  56  73  13  20  28
3  88   4  71  71   1  96  66   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items that they value highly, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. The total number of items is 8, and there are 4 agents, so ideally, each agent should receive 2 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Highest valued items: 1 (value 97), 7 (value 68)
   - Allocate items [1, 7]

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Highest valued items: 4 (value 96), 5 (value 76)
   - Allocate items [4, 5]

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Highest valued items: 0 (value 91), 2 (value 68)
   - Allocate items [0, 2]

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Highest valued items: 3 (value 71), 5 (value 96) - item 5 is already allocated, so choose the next highest
   - Allocate item [3, 6]

This allocation gives each agent 2 items, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
