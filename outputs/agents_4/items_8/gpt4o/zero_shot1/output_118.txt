Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  98  64  72  42  23  85  12
1  63   5  97  97  22  33  77  76
2  82  65  48  66  49  18  84  46
3  34  50  71  26  41  12  33  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents. A reasonable approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and that only 8 items are allocated in total.

Let's examine the valuations:

| Agent | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|
| Item 0 | 5  | 63 | 82 | 34 |
| Item 1 | 98 | 5  | 65 | 50 |
| Item 2 | 64 | 97 | 48 | 71 |
| Item 3 | 72 | 97 | 66 | 26 |
| Item 4 | 42 | 22 | 49 | 41 |
| Item 5 | 23 | 33 | 18 | 12 |
| Item 6 | 85 | 77 | 84 | 33 |
| Item 7 | 12 | 76 | 46 | 60 |

Based on the highest valuations, here is a potential allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 (82)
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 (98)
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 (97)
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 (97)
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 (49)
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 (33)
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 (85)
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 (60)

This distribution ensures that each agent gets at least one item and that the total number of allocated items is 8. Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [7]
}
```
