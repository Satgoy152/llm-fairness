Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  18  64  55  93  14  13  78
1  49  51  42  48  71  44   1  81
2  83  45  13  18  25  53  66  85
3  55   9  74   7   5   1  28  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, given that there are 8 items and 4 agents.

Let's consider a strategy where we try to assign the highest-value item for each agent first, then distribute the remaining items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item is item 4 (value 93).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item is item 7 (value 81).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item is item 7 (value 85), but since item 7 is already taken by Agent 1, we choose the next highest value, item 0 (value 83).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item is item 2 (value 74).

Having assigned one item to each agent, we have 4 remaining items (1, 3, 5, 6) to distribute. 

Let's assign the remaining items by considering the next highest value each agent has for the unallocated items:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest value is item 0 (value 72), but it's already taken. Next, item 6 (value 13) is the highest among the remaining.
- **Agent 1**: Highest unallocated value is item 1 (value 51).
- **Agent 2**: Highest unallocated value is item 5 (value 53).
- **Agent 3**: Highest unallocated value is item 3 (value 7).

Let's allocate accordingly:

- Agent 0 gets items 4 and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 7 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 5.
- Agent 3 gets items 2 and 3.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
