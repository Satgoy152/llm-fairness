Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  15  64  31   6   7  83  87
1  58  72  59  90  73   7  53   9
2  98  26  98  23  76  52  88   6
3   3  71   4  26  61  44  37  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 4 agents and 8 items, ideally, each agent should receive 2 items, but the allocation should also consider maximizing each agent's utility.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Determine which items hold the highest value for each agent. This helps in ensuring each agent gets the items they value most.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Begin by assigning each agent their highest-value item.

3. **Balance the Allocation**: After each agent receives one item, distribute the remaining items to maintain fairness, considering both the total value and the number of items each agent receives.

4. **Ensure Completeness**: Make sure that all items are allocated and that each agent receives a fair share.

Let's perform the allocation:

### Initial High-Value Items:
- Agent 0: Items 6 (83) and 7 (87)
- Agent 1: Items 3 (90) and 1 (72)
- Agent 2: Items 0 (98) and 2 (98)
- Agent 3: Items 1 (71) and 4 (61)

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign each agent their highest-value available item initially.
- Allocate remaining items to balance the total value, ensuring each agent has at least one item.

### Final Allocation:
Based on the above considerations, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: [6, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]
- Agent 3: [4, 5]

### JSON Format of Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and the allocation considers both fairness in terms of the number of items and the value each agent places on the items they receive.
