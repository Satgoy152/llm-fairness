Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  59  83  74   7  78  82  32
1  23   5  14  50  25  98  60  21
2  48  54  75   6  55  92  13   8
3  23   3  26  94  30  35  94   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values items 0, 2, and 6 highly. However, we can allocate items based on their overall distribution to balance the allocations.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a high valuation for item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values items 2 and 5 significantly.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has a high valuation for items 3 and 6.

Considering a balanced distribution, here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2], as they have high values for these items.
- **Agent 1**: Items [5], which they value the most.
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 4], balancing the distribution and ensuring they get items they value reasonably.
- **Agent 3**: Items [3, 6, 7], as they have high valuations for items 3 and 6, and item 7 balances the count.

This allocation ensures each agent receives some of the items they value while also distributing the items among all agents. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 6, 7]
}
```
