Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  40   3  15  22  94  87  93
1   3  59  99  35  47  22  20  63
2  19   2  75  22   2   4   6  85
3  77  82  29  72  62  98  87  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the values each agent assigns to each item and try to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a strategy that considers each agent's preferences and balances the distribution of items.

Let's analyze the given matrix and make an allocation:

```
        Items
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
Agents
0      73  40   3  15  22  94  87  93
1       3  59  99  35  47  22  20  63
2      19   2  75  22   2   4   6  85
3      77  82  29  72  62  98  87  90
```

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (94), Item 7 (93), Item 6 (87)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (99), Item 7 (63), Item 4 (47)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (85), Item 2 (75), Item 3 (22)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (98), Item 1 (82), Item 7 (90)

Let's allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring a balanced distribution:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 3 (highest value at 98).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value at 99).
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 0 (next highest value at 93).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 3 (next highest value at 82).
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (next highest value at 87).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest value at 22).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 3 (next highest value at 77).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value at 47).

Now, let's summarize these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, with items distributed based on their preferences.
