Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  42  18  29  86  74   6  97
1  50  36  40  16  40  98  13  73
2  78  10  19  52  58  64  22  65
3  48  31  13  20  92  52  30  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[22 42 18 29 86 74  6 97]
 [50 36 40 16 40 98 13 73]

 [48 31 13 20 92 52 30 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to optimize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Considering there are 8 items and 4 agents, ideally, each agent should receive 2 items to maintain fairness. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 7: Valuation 97 (highest valuation for Agent 0)
   - Item 4: Valuation 86 (second highest valuation for Agent 0)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 5: Valuation 98 (highest valuation for Agent 1)
   - Item 0: Valuation 50 (second highest valuation for Agent 1)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 6: Valuation 22 (highest remaining valuation for Agent 2)
   - Item 3: Valuation 52 (second highest valuation for Agent 2)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 4 was already taken by Agent 0
   - Item 2: Valuation 13
   - Item 1: Valuation 31 (highest remaining valuation for Agent 3)

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```

Each agent receives exactly 2 items, and all 8 items are allocated.
