Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  77   5  26  63  56  24   8
1  20  38  27  20   5  96   9  97
2  21  43  21  69   0  55  32   8
3  88  97  72  17  67  15  60  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing each agent's overall satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is reasonably happy with their allocated items and that each agent gets at least one item. However, since there are 8 items and 4 agents, one or more agents may get more than one item.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that have higher values for Agent 0 compared to others.
2. **Agent 1**: Similar strategy, look for items that Agent 1 values highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items with relatively high values for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items that are highly valued by Agent 3, given the remaining items.

Based on the table, the allocations could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items that Agent 0 values highly include 0 (79) and 1 (77).
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 (96) and 7 (97) are valued highly by Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items that Agent 2 values reasonably like 3 (69).
- **Agent 3**: Items 6 (60) and 2 (72) are highly valued by Agent 3.

Let's ensure the allocation satisfies all conditions and present it in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 6, 4]
}
```

Note: This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a reasonable set of items based on their respective valuations.
