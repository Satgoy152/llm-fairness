Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54   5  70  33  62  63   7  22
1  36  23  96  81  17  29  71  15
2  23  56  70  10  95  12  45  32
3  73  13  23  78  23  66  28  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should receive exactly 2 items. 

Let's start by evaluating which items each agent values the most and distribute the items accordingly:

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (70) and Item 4 (62)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (96) and Item 3 (81)
   - However, since Item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we assign the next highest: Item 6 (71)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (95) and Item 1 (56)
   - However, Item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0, so assign: Item 0 (23)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (84) and Item 3 (78)
   - However, Item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, so assign: Item 5 (66)

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 0]
- Agent 3: Items [7, 5]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [7, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and all 8 items are distributed.
