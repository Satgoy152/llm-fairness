Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  51  31  91  64  94  97  20
1  46  12  20  95  57  56  35  11
2  37  73  37  73  69  89  48  44
3  95  46  64  66  16  54  60  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0, given their high valuations.
2. **Agent 1**: Choose items that maximize value without overlapping too much with Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that are still available and offer good value.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign remaining items, balancing the total value.

Following this strategy, we can make the allocations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 can receive items 4 and 7 as they provide a reasonable value.
- Agent 2 can take item 1, which has a high value for them.
- Agent 3 can take item 2, balancing the distribution.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
