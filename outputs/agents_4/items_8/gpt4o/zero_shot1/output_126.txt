Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  63  76  65  71  45  50  81
1  85  27   9  65  96  98  79  90
2  33  40  58  21  87  23  95  27
3  92  12  65   7  21   8  20  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation of the allocation. This method involves assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 1, and 7.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 5, 4, and 0.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 6, 4, and 2.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 7.

To ensure a fair allocation, we will try to distribute items so that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is highly valued.
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it is highly valued.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 3, as it is highly valued.

Next, allocate the remaining items:

5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value).
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value).
7. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (next highest value).
8. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (next highest value).

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has received at least one item. The allocation maximizes individual valuations as much as possible, given the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
