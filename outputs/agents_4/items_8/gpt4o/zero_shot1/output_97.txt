Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  28  52  67  28  78  56   6
1  91  35  45  13  13  18  75  90
2  97  20  55  19  76  10  78  12
3  86  71  84  31  82  52  84  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item. A possible approach to ensure fairness is to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while distributing the items as evenly as possible.

Let's distribute the items step by step:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuations for each item and assign the items to the respective agents if possible.
2. Ensure that each agent receives a fair share of items (in this case, 2 items per agent since there are 8 items and 4 agents).

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: 
  - Items 0 (value 98), 5 (value 78)
- Agent 1:
  - Items 7 (value 90), 2 (value 45)
- Agent 2:
  - Items 6 (value 78), 4 (value 76)
- Agent 3:
  - Items 3 (value 31), 1 (value 71)

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives 2 items. 

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```
