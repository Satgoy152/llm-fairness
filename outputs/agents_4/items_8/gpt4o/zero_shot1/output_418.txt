Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  40  54  74  50  98  44  75
1  45  69  67   5  61  11  19  25
2   8  43  93   3  25  96  98  88
3  49  13  25  53  10  36   2   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

After examining the table of valuations, here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (98), so let's allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (69), so let's allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (98), so let's allocate item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 3, with lower valuation options, values item 0 the highest (49), so let's allocate item 0 to agent 3.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the second highest (93), so let's allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 0 values item 3 the second highest (74), so let's allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the second highest (61), so let's allocate item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the third highest (88), so let's allocate item 7 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 6, 7],
    "3": [0]
}
```
