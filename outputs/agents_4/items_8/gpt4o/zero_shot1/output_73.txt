Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37   9  99   4  64  86  11  81
1  60  11   3  57   5  79  12  67
2  86   5  40  47  52  72  47  32
3  23  39   5  13  80  86  16  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple approach to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, assuming each agent should receive an item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation across all agents, or alternatively, to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations on items 2 and 5, so it's reasonable to give them item 2.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0, so we can allocate that item to them.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0, but since it's already allocated, we can give them item 5, which they also value well.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly, so we can allocate that item to them.

Now, we allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can also receive item 7, which they value more than others.
- Agent 1 can receive item 3, which they value more compared to others.
- Agent 2 can receive item 6, which they value reasonably well.
- Agent 3 can receive item 1, as they value it more than others.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```
