Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  33  59  76   8  91   2  32
1  64  28  87  60   9  50  34  71
2  33  41  48  35  74  21  92  76
3  38  36  88  76  95  25  20  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 3** values item 4 very highly (95), so let's allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 2** values item 6 very highly (92), so let's allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** values item 5 very highly (91), so let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** values item 2 very highly (87), so let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 3** values item 2 highly as well (88), but Agent 1 has already received it. Agent 3 values item 3 highly too (76), so let's allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 1** also values item 7 relatively high (71), so let's allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 2** values item 7 highly (76), but Agent 1 has already received it. Instead, Agent 2 can take item 0, which they value at 33. 
8. **Agent 0** values item 1 moderately (33), and since it's available, let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
