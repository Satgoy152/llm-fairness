Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  19  90  54  93   8  28  79
1  36  51   7  60  94  20  62  68
2  18  20  85  66  18  96  82  29
3  87  27  24  82   9  83  95  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an approximately equal total value from the items they are allocated. We will aim to distribute the items in a way that balances the total valuations as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: 6, 19, 90, 54, 93, 8, 28, 79
- Agent 1: 36, 51, 7, 60, 94, 20, 62, 68
- Agent 2: 18, 20, 85, 66, 18, 96, 82, 29
- Agent 3: 87, 27, 24, 82, 9, 83, 95, 30

To achieve a fair allocation, we will attempt to give each agent a comparable total value of items. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1], total value = 6 + 19 = 25
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 4], total value = 60 + 94 = 154
- Agent 2 receives items [5, 7], total value = 96 + 29 = 125
- Agent 3 receives items [2, 6], total value = 24 + 95 = 119

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the total valuations are balanced as closely as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items to the agents.
