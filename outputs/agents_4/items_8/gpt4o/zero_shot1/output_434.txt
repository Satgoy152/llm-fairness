Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  82  64   8  51  33  14  53
1  99  43   6   9   3   8  52  40
2  58  75  97  58  62  65  75  11
3  59  22  18  66   9  72  57  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the highest valuation for each agent.
2. Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation, ensuring no item is assigned more than once and each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Ensure all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 (70), 1 (82), and 2 (64).
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0 (99).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 (97), 5 (65), and 6 (75).
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5 (72).

We will assign items based on these valuations while ensuring all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 1 (82) and 7 (53)
- Agent 1: Items 0 (99)
- Agent 2: Items 2 (97), 5 (65), and 6 (75)
- Agent 3: Items 3 (66) and 4 (9)

Now let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and agents receive items based on what they value highly, while each agent receives a fair distribution of items.
