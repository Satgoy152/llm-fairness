Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  26  53  72  50  61  94  93
1  35   0  15  99   5  96  16  16
2  41  93  67  46  66  55   1  12
3  99  66  58  36  28  16  19  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and aim for a balanced distribution where each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has relatively high valuations for items 0, 3, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a particularly high valuation for item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 0.

With these considerations in mind, here's one possible allocation:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 because of high valuation.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 due to the highest valuation.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 because of the highest valuation.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 as it has the highest value for it.

Now, consider remaining items 2, 4, 5, and 6:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (second-highest among unassigned items for Agent 2).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (third-highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (remaining item).

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items with a balance in terms of their valuations.
