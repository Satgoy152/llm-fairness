Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  50  19  31  52  75  58   3
1  24  15  23  71   4  54  39  27
2  66  15  12  77  75  89  84  51
3  66  38  16  95  57  52  39  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider their valuations to ensure that the distribution is as equitable as possible. We can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [0, 50, 19, 31, 52, 75, 58, 3]
- Agent 1: [24, 15, 23, 71, 4, 54, 39, 27]
- Agent 2: [66, 15, 12, 77, 75, 89, 84, 51]
- Agent 3: [66, 38, 16, 95, 57, 52, 39, 15]

A potential allocation strategy is to assign items based on the highest unique valuation or distribute items to balance the overall value received by each agent.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 5
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 7
- Agent 2 receives items 2, 6
- Agent 3 receives items 0, 4

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.
