Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  70  51  29  87  83  57  14
1  92  72  57  26  50  13  18  91
2  17  99  65  41  64  40  25  26
3  28   5  23  11  49   9  41  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives one or more items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (87), Item 5 (83), and Item 1 (70).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (92), Item 7 (91), and Item 1 (72).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 2 (65), and Item 4 (64).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (77), Item 4 (49), and Item 6 (41).

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 4 and Item 5 (high values for Agent 0 and not as high for others).
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 0 and Item 7 (highest value for both items).
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 1 and Item 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Assign Item 3 and Item 6 (remaining items).

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
