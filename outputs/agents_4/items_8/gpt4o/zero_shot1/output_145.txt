Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  36  14  83  49  12  51  56
1  25  31  74  70  15  79  48  29
2  79  40   9  80  14  82  62  59
3  80  96  95  78  35  93  57  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to consider each agent's valuation of the items and distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Items 3 (83), 0 (52)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Items 2 (74), 5 (79)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Items 3 (80), 5 (82)
   - Since item 3 is already taken by Agent 0 and item 5 by Agent 1, we'll try to assign other high-value items.
   - Alternative high valuations: Items 6 (62), 7 (59)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: Items 1 (96), 2 (95)

Considering the allocations above, let's distribute the items:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 0
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 6, 7
- Agent 3: Items 1, 4

Now, the JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share of the items based on their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated among the agents.
