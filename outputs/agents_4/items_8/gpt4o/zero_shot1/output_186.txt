Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  45  85  28  75  17  20   5
1  43  99  37  87  58  57  68  42
2  87  86  78  77  22  56  98  22
3  76  48  75  89  87   4   5  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Valuations**: We will examine the valuation table to find which items are most valued by each agent.

2. **Initial Allocations**: Assign items to agents based on the highest value an agent assigns to an item, ensuring each item is only allocated once.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Re-evaluate the allocations to ensure that each agent has a fair share of items. If some agents have particularly low total valuations, consider reallocating items from agents with higher total valuations.

4. **Finalize Allocations**: Ensure all 8 items are allocated and no item is allocated twice.

Let's start with the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [89, 45, 85, 28, 75, 17, 20, 5]
Agent 1: [43, 99, 37, 87, 58, 57, 68, 42]
Agent 2: [87, 86, 78, 77, 22, 56, 98, 22]
Agent 3: [76, 48, 75, 89, 87, 4, 5, 60]
```

**Initial Allocation**:
- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 89)
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 99)
- Agent 2 gets item 6 (value 98)
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (value 89)

**Remaining Items**: 2, 4, 5, 7

**Re-evaluation and Allocation**:
- Agent 0 also values item 2 highly (value 85), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly (value 87), so allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly (value 56), so allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 values item 7 (value 42), allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4]

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
