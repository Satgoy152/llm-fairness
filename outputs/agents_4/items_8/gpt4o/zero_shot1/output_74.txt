Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  82   8  50  48  79  18  88
1  40  86  64   5  50  62  12  24
2  19   5  73  31  96  54  69  14
3  34  77  36  44  18  15  72   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the given valuations and allocate items to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 7.**
2. **Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.**
3. **Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 and 6.**
4. **Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1 and 6.**

Considering these insights, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 0 (value: 92)
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 1 (value: 86)
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 1 (value: 64)
- **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 3 (value: 44)
- **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 2 (value: 96)
- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 0 (value: 79)
- **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 3 (value: 72)
- **Item 7**: Allocate to Agent 0 (value: 88)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable number of items based on their preferences, and all items are distributed. 

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
