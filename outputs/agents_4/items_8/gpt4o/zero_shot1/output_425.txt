Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  46   2  93  37  80  50  58
1  40  53  33  43  53  18  89   8
2   1  67  66  32  78   6  87  57
3   0  85   8  49  81  51  65  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total valuation. Let's approach this problem using a method that attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives a relatively balanced share according to their preferences.

The total number of items is 8, and we have 4 agents, so ideally, each agent would receive 2 items. However, based on the valuation matrix, we might need to adjust this slightly to ensure a fair distribution.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Review the valuation table to identify which items are highly valued by each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives approximately the same number of items.

Let's proceed with allocating the items:

- Agent 0 highly values items 3 (93) and 0 (81).
- Agent 1 highly values items 6 (89) and 1 (53).
- Agent 2 highly values items 4 (78) and 2 (66).
- Agent 3 highly values items 7 (93) and 1 (85). However, item 1 is already allocated to Agent 1, so Agent 3 will take item 5 (51) instead.

Considering these preferences, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: [3, 0]
- Agent 1: [6, 1]
- Agent 2: [4, 2]
- Agent 3: [7, 5]

This allocation gives each agent 2 items, and all 8 items are distributed.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [7, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value and that all items are distributed fairly among the agents.
