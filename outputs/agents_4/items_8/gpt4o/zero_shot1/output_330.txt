Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  49  49  45  92  89  86  46
1  60  70  57  84  39  13  65  84
2  90  24  59  91  13  24  42  31
3  85  52  16  21  34  93  86  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to take into account each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that the distribution is as equitable as possible. A common strategy is to use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 4, 5, and 6.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 and decent valuation for item 3.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 5 and 6.

Considering these observations, let's allocate the items in a way that tries to maximize each agent's utility based on their valuation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 7
- Agent 3: Items 2, 6

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is made in a way that considers the valuation each agent places on the items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```
