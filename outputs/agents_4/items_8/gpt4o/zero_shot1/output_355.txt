Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  79  76   3  56  22  84  35
1  73  48  85  29  73  72  89  45
2  88  84  76  40   4  51  15   3
3  33  98   4   7  22  69  67  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction or value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a balanced allocation:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent:** Start by assigning the item that each agent values the most. This ensures each agent gets something they value highly.

2. **Reassess and allocate remaining items:** Once each agent has one item, allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest value each agent has for any unallocated items. 

3. **Check for fairness:** Ensure that all items are allocated and no agent gets significantly less value than others.

Following this approach:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (84), assign item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most (89), but it's already allocated. Next highest for agent 1 is item 2 (85), assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (88), assign item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (98), assign item 1 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated four items, one to each agent. Allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 3, 4, 5, 7.
- Agent 0's next highest is item 0 (81), but it's taken. Next, item 1 (79) is taken, then item 4 (56), assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has no additional items left that are highest in value compared to others, so we consider next based on availability and balanced value distribution.
- Agent 2's next highest is item 3 (40), assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3's next highest is item 5 (69), assign item 5 to agent 3.

Now, only item 7 is left:

- Compare values for item 7 among agents:
  - Agent 0: 35
  - Agent 1: 45
  - Agent 2: 3
  - Agent 3: 62

Assign item 7 to Agent 3 as they value it the most.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation provides a fairly balanced distribution of items based on the agents' valuations.
