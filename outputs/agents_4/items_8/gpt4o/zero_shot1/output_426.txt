Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  15  22  91  85  33  57  49
1  51  74   1  29  13  91  38  69
2  88  82  18  46  81  96  21  39
3  89  47  37  26  25  86  82  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on the items they receive. This approach considers that each agent should get a fair share depending on their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation that aims to distribute the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0:** This agent has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4. Allocating item 0 to Agent 0 makes sense since it has the highest value (66) compared to other agents' valuations for item 0.

2. **Agent 1:** This agent has a high valuation for item 1. Allocating item 1 to Agent 1 helps maximize their total value.

3. **Agent 2:** This agent has high valuations for items 5 and 2. Allocating item 5 to Agent 2 makes sense since it has the highest value (96) for item 5 compared to other agents.

4. **Agent 3:** This agent has high valuations for items 6 and 7. Allocating item 7 to Agent 3 makes sense since it is tied for the highest value (82) they have for items 6 and 7.

Let's ensure each agent receives at least one item and that all 8 items are allocated fairly:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 3]
- **Agent 1:** Items [1, 6]
- **Agent 2:** Items [5, 2]
- **Agent 3:** Items [4, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, while also ensuring the distribution is fair and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints of the problem and aims to provide a fair distribution of items based on the given valuations.
