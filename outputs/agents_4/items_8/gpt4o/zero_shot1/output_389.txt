Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  36  21  22  21  47  78  85
1  35  57  55  87  21  50  31  75
2  68   9  13  63   8  63  79  18
3  92  27  66  12  40  18  33   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure each agent receives items in such a way that maximizes their satisfaction. We can use a method that considers both the number of items each agent gets and the total value they receive from those items.

Let's walk through a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 6 and 7. We can allocate these items to Agent 0.
   - Allocated items: [6, 7]

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the most, followed by item 2. Allocating these will be beneficial for this agent.
   - Allocated items: [2, 3]

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values items 0 and 5 significantly. Allocating these will maximize their satisfaction.
   - Allocated items: [0, 5]

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 the most, followed by item 4. These allocations will be suitable for this agent.
   - Allocated items: [1, 4]

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their valuations, and all items are distributed among the agents.
