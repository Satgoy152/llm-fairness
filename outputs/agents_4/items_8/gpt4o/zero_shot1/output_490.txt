Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  59  47  40  66  44  11  22
1  18   2  28  55  82  12  19  16
2  91  66  13  73  59  36  40  24
3  33  54  69  48  31  44  63  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations provided in the table. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible and all items are allocated.

Given the constraints, let's start by examining the highest valuation each agent has for the items and try to allocate items based on those preferences.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are item 4 (66), item 1 (59), and item 2 (47).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is item 4 (82), followed by item 3 (55).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is item 0 (91), followed by item 3 (73).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is item 2 (69), followed by item 7 (68).

Let's allocate items step-by-step:

- **Allocate item 4** to Agent 1 because they value it the highest (82).
- **Allocate item 0** to Agent 2 because they value it the highest (91).
  
Now, consider the next highest valuations:

- **Allocate item 3** to Agent 2 because they value it the next highest (73).
- **Allocate item 1** to Agent 0 because it's one of the highest (59) they value among remaining items.
- **Allocate item 7** to Agent 3 because they value it highly (68).

Now, we have allocated 5 items. Let's distribute the remaining items:

- **Allocate item 2** to Agent 3 because they value it highly (69).
- **Allocate item 6** to Agent 3 because they value it (63).
- **Allocate item 5** to Agent 0 as it's the remaining item that maximizes their valuation.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [7, 2, 6]
}
```
