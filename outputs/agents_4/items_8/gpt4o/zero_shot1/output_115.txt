Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  18  24  95  96  73  76  48
1  20  76  12  47  63  42  66  58
2  15  10  41  46  61   2  32  37
3  51  43  32  97  90  82   0  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent with the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the total allocation doesn't exceed 8 items. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Assess Total Value for Each Agent:**
   Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their overall preference strength.

2. **Item Assignment:**
   Start by assigning items based on the highest individual valuations for each agent, ensuring that the most valued items are assigned first.

3. **Balance the Allocation:**
   Ensure each agent gets at least one item, redistribute if necessary to maintain fairness while considering the total valuation balance.

4. **Final Allocations:**
   Verify that exactly 8 items are allocated in total, and no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest values are for items 3 (95) and 4 (96). Assign these two items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** Highest values are for items 1 (76) and 4 (63). However, item 4 is already allocated. Assign items 0 (20) and 1 (76) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** Highest values are for items 2 (41) and 4 (61). Assign items 2 and 6 (32) to Agent 2, since item 4 is allocated.

4. **Agent 3:** Highest values are for items 3 (97) and 5 (82). Assign items 5 (82) and 7 (28) to Agent 3, since item 3 is allocated.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [5, 7]

Now, presenting the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
