Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  83  99   5  88  22  69  51
1  54  82  84  51   5  88  19  61
2  13  48  39  65  52  89  48  87
3  24  92  41  79  77  51  22  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them items they value highly. However, we also need to ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items, which in this case means each agent should receive 2 items because there are 8 items and 4 agents.

One potential allocation strategy is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives two items. Let's go through the table and determine an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (99) and 4 (88).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (82) and 5 (88).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 5 (89) and 7 (87).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (92) and 3 (79).

Let's attempt to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 and 6 (since item 4 is better suited for other agents)
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 and 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 7 and 4
- **Agent 3**: Items 1 and 0

Each agent gets 2 items, and all 8 items are allocated. Here are the allocations formatted in JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```
