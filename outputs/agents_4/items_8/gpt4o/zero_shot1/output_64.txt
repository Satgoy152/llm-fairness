Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  97  20  42  73  19  35  87
1  77  28  50  17  21  76  69  80
2   3  34  43  44  61  78  93   5
3  86  55  26  69  71   0   6  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the individual satisfaction of each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. One common method is to use a greedy allocation strategy based on each agent’s valuation of the items. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Evaluate the Valuation Matrix:** Start by examining the agents’ valuations for each item.

2. **Assign Items to Agents:** Allocate items to the agents by selecting the agent who values each item the most, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

3. **Ensure Fairness:** Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items, as much as possible.

Let's go through the items one by one, assigning them to the agents who value them the most, while keeping fairness in mind:

- **Item 0:** Valuations are [86, 77, 3, 86]. Both Agent 0 and Agent 3 value it the same. Let's assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Valuations are [97, 28, 34, 55]. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Valuations are [20, 50, 43, 26]. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Valuations are [42, 17, 44, 69]. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- **Item 4:** Valuations are [73, 21, 61, 71]. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Item 5:** Valuations are [19, 76, 78, 0]. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- **Item 6:** Valuations are [35, 69, 93, 6]. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Item 7:** Valuations are [87, 80, 5, 66]. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.

Now, let's review the item distribution to ensure fairness. Agent 0 was initially assigned 4 items, Agent 1 has 1, Agent 2 has 2, and Agent 3 has 1. To maintain fairness (each agent should ideally get 2 items), we can reallocate one of Agent 0's items to another agent in need:

- Reallocate item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 3.

After reallocation, the distribution becomes:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 7]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [5, 6]
- Agent 3: [3, 4]

This allocation gives each agent a fair share. Here is the final JSON output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
