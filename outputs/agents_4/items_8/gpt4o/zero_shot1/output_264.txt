Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  45  13  96  63  62  21  38
1  83  43  18  28  42  55  36  33
2  74  16  89  63  48  50  57  13
3  90  24  21  75  93  51  14  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize overall satisfaction, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 8.

One common approach is to allocate the items to the agents who value them the most, thus maximizing total valuation. However, as fairness is the goal, we might need to ensure a more balanced distribution. Let's proceed with a balanced allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values highest: Item 3 (96), Item 0 (75)
   - Allocate: Item 3

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values highest: Item 0 (83), Item 2 (18)
   - Allocate: Item 0

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values highest: Item 2 (89), Item 6 (57)
   - Allocate: Item 2, Item 6

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values highest: Item 7 (97), Item 4 (93)
   - Allocate: Item 7, Item 4

Remaining items to allocate: 1, 5

5. **Reallocate remaining items**:
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (45)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (55)

After this allocation, the distribution looks balanced and maximizes satisfaction based on who values the items most:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and it tries to respect the highest valuations while distributing items as fairly as possible.
