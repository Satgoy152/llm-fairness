Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  19  45  21  64  78  55  47
1  34  51  69  71   8  60  31  11
2   2  46  10  32  18  36  82  87
3  18  18  41  22  59  52   4  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We will also ensure that all items are allocated.

Let's start by evaluating the highest value each agent assigns to the items and allocate the items accordingly:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuations for item 5 (78) and item 4 (64).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuations for item 3 (71) and item 2 (69).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuations for item 7 (87) and item 6 (82).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4 (59), but item 4 is already considered for Agent 0, so we look for the next highest that hasn't been allocated, which is item 7, but it's considered for Agent 2.

Given the competition for items, we need to finalize allocations to ensure fairness and avoid conflicts:

Let's allocate based on the highest unique values each agent has:

- Agent 0: Items 5 (78) and 4 (64)
- Agent 1: Items 3 (71) and 2 (69)
- Agent 2: Items 7 (87) and 6 (82)
- Agent 3: We need to ensure all agents get items, so allocate remaining items: 0 (18) and 1 (18), given that these are lower values and no conflicts with high-value allocations for other agents.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
