Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  88  41  61  65   6  67  13
1   3  81  74  53  25  70  98  12
2  46  35  74   8  36  87  20  98
3   7  31  60  75  69  83  18   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. We'll try to distribute the items so that each agent gets about two items since there are eight items total and four agents. Let's try to make a balanced and fair allocation.

First, let's look at the highest valuations per agent to determine which items each agent values the most:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest valuations are for items: 0 (91), 1 (88)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valuations are for items: 6 (98), 2 (74)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest valuations are for items: 7 (98), 5 (87)

- **Agent 3:**
  - Highest valuations are for items: 5 (83), 3 (75)

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0:** Allocate items 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 1:** Allocate items 6 and 2.
3. **Agent 2:** Allocate items 7 and 5.
4. **Agent 3:** Allocate items 3 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, maximizing their satisfaction based on the highest values they have assigned to those items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
