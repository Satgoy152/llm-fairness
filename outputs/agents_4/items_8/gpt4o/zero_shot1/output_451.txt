Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  17  62  49  32  52  65  21
1  29  41  43  62  11  85  43  74
2  74  37  53  23  64  89  10  35
3   6  96  29  91  22  27  91  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible. Given the valuations, we can try to distribute items to achieve a fair allocation.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High-value items: 2 (62), 6 (65)
   - Potential allocation: [2, 6]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High-value items: 5 (85), 3 (62)
   - Potential allocation: [5, 3]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High-value items: 5 (89), 0 (74), 4 (64)
   - Potential allocation: [0, 4]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High-value items: 1 (96), 3 (91), 6 (91)
   - Potential allocation: [1, 7]

Now, let's ensure we allocate all items with no overlap:

- Agent 0: [2, 6] 
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]
- Agent 3: [1, 3, 7]

This allocation ensures each agent gets some items, and the total number of items allocated is 8. Here is the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
