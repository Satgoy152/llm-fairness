Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  62  97  90  33  68   6  81
1  52  89  69  11  72  79   2  32
2  59  59  27  72  20  40  83   7
3  39  52  17  48  52  15  37  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Here's a suggested allocation that attempts to balance the distribution according to the agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations for items: 2 (97), 3 (90), 1 (62)
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations for items: 1 (89), 5 (79), 4 (72)
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations for items: 6 (83), 3 (72), 0 (59)
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - High valuations for items: 1 (52), 4 (52), 7 (51)

Allocation Plan:
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 6, 0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This distribution considers the preferences of the agents and ensures each agent receives a fair number of items relative to their expressed valuations.
