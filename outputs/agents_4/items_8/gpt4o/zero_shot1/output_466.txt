Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  25  81  83  66  99  92  47
1  87  87  86  61  71  62  50  14
2  20  61   1  81  43  38  56  27
3  66  75  63  78  71  21   7  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll use a greedy approach to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item until all items are allocated.

Let's begin by analyzing the highest value each agent places on the items:

1. Agent 0's highest values: 
   - Item 5: 99
   - Item 6: 92
   - Item 3: 83

2. Agent 1's highest values:
   - Item 0: 87
   - Item 1: 87
   - Item 2: 86

3. Agent 2's highest values:
   - Item 3: 81
   - Item 1: 61
   - Item 6: 56

4. Agent 3's highest values:
   - Item 1: 75
   - Item 3: 78
   - Item 4: 71

We will allocate based on the highest unique item valuation for each agent first, then fill in the remaining items with a focus on maintaining fairness:

1. Allocate each agent one item they value highly:
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (99)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (87)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (81)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (75)

2. Allocate remaining items:
   - Items left: 2, 4, 6, 7

3. Assign remaining items to maximize fairness:
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (92)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (71)
   - Agent 2: Item 7 (27)
   - Agent 3: Item 2 (63)

Now, all items have been allocated. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations.
