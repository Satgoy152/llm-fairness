Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  78  98  91  85  47  45  20
1   8  81  85  52  89  14  38  99
2  43  38  86  17  14  36  89  31
3  32  71  37  70  11  54  85   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of the items. A common approach to fair division is to use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly, to the extent possible.

Here is an allocation that aims to achieve a fair division:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (98).
   - Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (99).
   - Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (89).
   - Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (54).
   - Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, for the remaining items (0, 1, 3, 4), let's distribute them to maximize each agent's total value:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - After item 2, Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (95).
   - Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - After item 7, Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (89).
   - Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 3**:
   - After item 5, Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (70).
   - Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

8. **Agent 2**:
   - After item 6, Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (38).
   - Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, every agent has received at least one item and all items have been assigned. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [5, 3]
}
```
