Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  40  71  68  65  63  88  25
1   8  22  92  61  89  70  99  46
2  74  85  16  74  62  22  21  81
3  30  41  93  53  82  22  20  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 40 71 68 65 63 88 25]
 [ 8 22 92 61 89 70 99 46]
 [74 85 16 74 62 22 21 81]
 [30 41 93 53 82 22 20 81]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we must consider a strategy that allows each agent to receive items in a manner that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Assign items that provide a decent valuation but are not the highest priority for other agents.
2. **Agent 1:** Assign items that have relatively high valuations for this agent.
3. **Agent 2:** Assign items that have a good valuation for this agent but are less competitive.
4. **Agent 3:** Assign items that are highly valued by this agent.

Given these considerations, here is a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 5]
- **Agent 3**: Items [3, 6]

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
