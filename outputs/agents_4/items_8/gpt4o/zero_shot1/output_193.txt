Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  91  88  84  50  60  68  35
1  11  93  86  67  73  96  95  37
2  54  85  16  69  24  42  11  54
3  22  22  29  23  47  65  49   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, whenever possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:**
   - Look at the valuations each agent has for the items and identify the highest values.

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Total Valuation:**
   - Allocate items to agents based on the highest available valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

3. **Ensure Fair Distribution:**
   - If possible, ensure that each agent receives at least one item. If not possible due to constraints, try to balance the allocation.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Highly values items 1 and 2 (91 and 88 respectively).
- **Agent 1:** Highly values items 5 and 6 (96 and 95 respectively).
- **Agent 2:** Highly values item 3 (69), but also item 0 (54).
- **Agent 3:** Can receive items with lower valuations since their highest value is 65 for item 5, which is already taken by Agent 1. Therefore, they should receive items with the next best available valuations.

Given these considerations, a possible fair allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while ensuring a fair distribution. Each item is assigned once, and each agent receives at least one item.
