Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  52  72  95   9  79  78  96
1  75  80  11  79  85  61  51  17
2  42  57  88  63  84  46  40  36
3  35  23  57  81  65  52  55  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that balances the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated. Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the agents' valuations:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 98.
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 80.
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 88.
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 95.
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 84.
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 79.
7. Item 6: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 78.
8. Item 7: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 96.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 3: No items allocated

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": []
}
```
