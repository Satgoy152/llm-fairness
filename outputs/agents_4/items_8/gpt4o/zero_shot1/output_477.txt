Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  90  30  30  95  40   5  39
1  35  74  32  41  31   6  27  91
2  94  42  45  28   6   8  60  27
3  54   4  95  22  38  80  71  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 74 32 41 31  6 27 91]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
    0   7  90  30  30  95  40   5  39
    1  35  74  32  41  31   6  27  91
    2  94  42  45  28   6   8  60  27
    3  54   4  95  22  38  80  71  22
```

We will try to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Highest preferences: Item 1 (90), Item 4 (95)
   - Allocated: Items 1 and 4

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Highest preferences: Item 7 (91), Item 0 (35)
   - Allocated: Items 7 and 0

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Highest preferences: Item 0 (94), Item 6 (60)
   - Allocated: Items 2 and 6

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Highest preferences: Item 2 (95), Item 5 (80)
   - Allocated: Items 3 and 5

This allocation ensures all 8 items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items, maximizing their individual preferences as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [7, 0],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on the given valuations.
