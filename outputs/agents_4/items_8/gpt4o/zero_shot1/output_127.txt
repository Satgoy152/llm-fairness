Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  98  40   6  27  65  63  82
1   6  85  50  82  97  18   6  17
2   2  44  60   0  70  26  50  77
3  90  78  73  65  97  26  13  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations to determine a fair allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations on items 0 (63), 1 (98), 5 (65), 6 (63), and 7 (82).
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations on items 1 (85), 2 (50), 3 (82), 4 (97).
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations on items 2 (60), 4 (70), 5 (26), 6 (50), and 7 (77).
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations on items 0 (90), 1 (78), 2 (73), 3 (65), 4 (97), and 7 (67).

A simple approach is to allocate items so that agents receive items with their highest valuations while balancing the total number of items allocated.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items 1 and 7 (valuations 98 and 82).
- **Agent 1**: Gets items 4 and 3 (valuations 97 and 82).
- **Agent 2**: Gets items 2 and 6 (valuations 60 and 50).
- **Agent 3**: Gets items 0 and 5 (valuations 90 and 26).

This allocation gives each agent two items, and it maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
