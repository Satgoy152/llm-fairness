Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  28  35  36  25   1  73  54
1  42   0  29   3  37  12  63  75
2  42  35  76  37   7   1  43  41
3  70  75  59  46  39  59  27  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable number of items. Given that there are four agents and eight items, each agent should ideally receive two items. However, we can adjust this if it leads to a better allocation.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [58, 28, 35, 36, 25, 1, 73, 54]
- Agent 1's valuations: [42, 0, 29, 3, 37, 12, 63, 75]
- Agent 2's valuations: [42, 35, 76, 37, 7, 1, 43, 41]
- Agent 3's valuations: [70, 75, 59, 46, 39, 59, 27, 88]

We can prioritize items based on the highest valuation by any agent while ensuring that the distribution is fair. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 7 (88), so allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 3** also has a high valuation for item 1 (75), so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2 (76), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (73), so allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 0** also has a high valuation for item 0 (58), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 (37), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 1** also has a reasonable valuation for item 4 (37), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
8. **Agent 2** has a decent valuation for item 5 (1), but this is a low value. Instead, allocate item 5 to Agent 2 as they have a low number of allocated items so far.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the allocation is based on the highest valuations for each item by any agent, while attempting to maintain fairness among the agents.
