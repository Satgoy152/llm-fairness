Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  94  65   0  20  39  85  42
1  33  85  12  34  11  48  89  69
2  90  88  96  45  99  46  66  14
3  82  39  89  90  18  41   9  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 85 12 34 11 48 89 69]
 [90 88 96 45 99 46 66 14]
 [82 39 89 90 18 41  9 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents.

Let's analyze the table and try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 0 highly (76) and item 6 (85).
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 6 highly (89).
3. **Agent 2:** Has high valuations for items 0 (90), 2 (96), and 4 (99).
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 3 highly (90).

Now, let's assign the items optimally:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (since they have the highest valuation of 90).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (since they have the highest valuation of 96).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest valuation of 99).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (since they have the highest valuation of 89).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (since they have the highest valuation of 90).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (since they have the second-highest valuation of 94 after Agent 2).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (since they have a good valuation of 48, and Agent 2 already has three items).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (since they have a decent valuation of 42).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing all items fairly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
