Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  45  84  79  68  82   9  79
1  99  36  84  93  54  52  76  61
2   3  17  29  34  14  70  16   4
3  53  57  77  34  41  93  99  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are fully distributed among the agents. One way to approach this is to consider the agents' valuations and try to assign items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction or value for each agent. 

Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's assign items that Agent 0 values highly. The highest values for Agent 0 are items 2 (value 84) and 5 (value 82).

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuations for items 0 (value 99) and 3 (value 93).

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 does not have particularly high valuations, but item 5 is the highest valued at 70. However, since item 5 is already allocated, we look at other available items. We can give Agent 2 items 1 (value 17) and 6 (value 16).

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 can take item 7, which has a high valuation of 12, as it is one of the highest available after considering other allocations.

Now let's format the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and attempts to maximize the valuations based on the given table for each agent.
