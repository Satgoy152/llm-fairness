Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  37  82   6  96   0  64  59
1  79  72   6  52  35  97  85  81
2  92  89  95   8  14  49   1  32
3  60  73   2  59  62  48  66  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their valuations. We need to ensure each agent receives at least one item (as we have 4 agents and 8 items), and the allocation should be as balanced as possible.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Highest value items: Item 4 (96), Item 2 (82)
   - Allocated items: [4, 2]

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Highest value items: Item 5 (97), Item 0 (79)
   - Allocated items: [5, 0]

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Highest value items: Item 2 (95), Item 1 (89)
   - Allocated items: [2, 1]

4. **Agent 3:**  
   - Highest value items: Item 7 (98), Item 3 (59)
   - Allocated items: [7, 3]

By giving each agent the items where they place the highest valuation, we attempt to maximize the satisfaction of each agent. Additionally, we ensure that all agents are assigned a fair number of items. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
