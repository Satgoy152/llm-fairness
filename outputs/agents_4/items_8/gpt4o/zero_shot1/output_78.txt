Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  15  42  91  58  59   5  30
1   6  74  69  54  12  56  11  46
2  94  43  36  76  26  65  39  11
3  48  30  79  73  86   8  35   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items 0 and 5 are highly valued by Agent 0 compared to others. 
   - Allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2 has a relatively high value for Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items 3 and 4 have high values for Agent 3.
   - Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 3.

Now, there are still items 6 and 7 left to allocate:

- **Item 6**: 
  - Agent 2 has a moderate valuation for item 6.
  - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

- **Item 7**: 
  - Agent 1 has a moderate valuation for item 7.
  - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

This gives us a balanced allocation where each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
