Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  59  71  27  86  61  33  16
1  38   9  99  96  11  94  11  85
2  58  53  54  81  63  86  85  82
3  98  25  31  98   8  48  22  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent gets is relatively balanced. This is a complex optimization problem, but I can provide a heuristic solution that attempts to balance the allocations based on the given valuations.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations and distributing the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has highest valuation for items [4, 2, 1].
2. **Agent 1**: Has highest valuation for items [2, 3, 5].
3. **Agent 2**: Has highest valuation for items [5, 3, 6].
4. **Agent 3**: Has highest valuation for items [0, 3, 7].

Considering these preferences, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: We can allocate items [4, 1] to Agent 0. This gives them high-value items while considering other agents' preferences.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [2, 3] to Agent 1. These items have high valuations for them.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items [5, 6] to Agent 2. These items are among the highest valued for them.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items [0, 7] to Agent 3. These are valuable to them without heavily conflicting with others.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the agents' preferences and distributes the items as evenly as possible given the constraints.
