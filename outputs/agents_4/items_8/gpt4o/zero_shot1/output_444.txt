Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  36  20  95  22  41  10  66
1  54  85  78  37  20  27  53  30
2  99  37   7  20   3  92  74  81
3  61  85  18  31  29  38   7  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's consider the valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll aim to distribute the items in a manner that reflects fairness, possibly considering each agent's highest-valued items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest-valued item is 3 with a value of 95.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest-valued item is 1 with a value of 85.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest-valued item is 0 with a value of 99.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest-valued item is 1 with a value of 85, but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 0 with a value of 61.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to distribute the remaining items (2, 5, 6, 7) among the agents:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Remaining highest-valued item is 7 with a value of 66.
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Remaining highest-valued item is 2 with a value of 78.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining highest-valued item is 5 with a value of 92.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 2.

8. **Agent 3**:
   - Remaining highest-valued item is 6 with a value of 7.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets some items and attempts to maximize the valuation for each agent.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
