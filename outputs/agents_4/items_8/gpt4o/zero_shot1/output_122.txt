Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  83  74  71  14  28  43  97
1  13  69  89  39   2  94  42  64
2  50  54  84  51   7  90  47  18
3  45  54  88  74  69  18  12  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's evaluate the items each agent values the most and attempt to allocate them accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 7 (97), Item 1 (83)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (94), Item 2 (89)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (90), Item 2 (84) – note items 5 and 2 are already considered by agent 1, so we'll assign next highest
   - Next highest available values: Item 3 (51), Item 6 (47)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (88), Item 3 (74) – note item 2 is already considered by agents 1 and 2, so we'll assign next highest
   - Next highest available values: Item 0 (45), Item 4 (69)

Here's a potential allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Item 7, Item 1
- **Agent 1:** Item 5, Item 2
- **Agent 2:** Item 6, Item 3
- **Agent 3:** Item 0, Item 4

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items and maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
