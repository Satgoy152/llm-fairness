Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96   6   5  42  29  48  81  93
1  26   9  86  92  24  98  71  31
2  53  88   1  64  72   6  77  45
3  18  99  69  15  70  22   8  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96  6  5 42 29 48 81 93]
 [26  9 86 92 24 98 71 31]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 96).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value 99).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 86).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 92).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 72).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 98).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 77).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value 93).

This allocation attempts to give each item to the agent who values it most, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1]
}
```
