Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  36   0  30  88  34  99  79
1  90  69  19  97  95  95  85  12
2  43   2  15  30  31  24   3  43
3  97  29  26   6  40  97  88  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We have 4 agents and 8 items, so each agent should get 2 items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0 and 7. Let's allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 3 and 4. Let's allocate these to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has moderate valuations, and items 5 and 6 are better choices compared to others for this agent. Let's allocate these to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 5, but since 5 is already allocated, we'll give items 1 and 2.

After allocation, the items are distributed fairly, and each agent has two items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
