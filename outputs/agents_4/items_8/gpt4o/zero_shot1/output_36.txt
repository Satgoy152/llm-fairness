Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  81  15  63  81   3  66  93
1  39  64  77  39  59  43  83  19
2  80  96  92  48  73  52  39  98
3  86  25  46  81  35  71  35  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that seeks to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

A simple way to approach this is to allocate items based on maximizing individual agent values while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (93).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (77).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (96).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (86).

Let's allocate these items first and then distribute the remaining items to maximize the values further:

1. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

The remaining items are 3, 4, 5, and 6. Allocate them based on the remaining highest valuations:

- Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 4 (81).
- Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for item 6 (83).
- Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 5 (52).
- Agent 3 has the next highest valuation for item 3 (81).

Now, each agent has two items, ensuring a fair and efficient allocation based on the given values:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
