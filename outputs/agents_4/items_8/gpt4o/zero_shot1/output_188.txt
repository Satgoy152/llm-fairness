Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  61  64  42  69  57  10  42
1  92  21   5   7  16  31  95  12
2  84  53   9  56  88  50  70  77
3  16  67   5  27  98  38  35  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

Let's consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value received by each agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. Allocating items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 maximizes their total value.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 highly. Assigning item 6 to Agent 1 gives them significant value.
3. **Agent 2**: Values items 4 and 7. Allocating these to Agent 2 gives them good value.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 highly. Assigning item 5 to Agent 3 gives them significant value.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items while considering their preferences, and exactly 8 items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
