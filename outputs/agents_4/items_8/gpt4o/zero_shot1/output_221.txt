Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  78  51  61  23  26  29  17
1  67  96  71  97  43  79  74  98
2  98  20  68  66  21  47  91  86
3  23  96  63  48  55  60  61  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction or is fair according to some criteria. One method is to allocate items such that each agent receives approximately the same total value from the items they receive, or to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents.

Let's proceed with a step-by-step approach:

1. **Sum of Valuations**: Calculate the total value each agent has for all items to help guide our allocation.
   
   - Agent 0: 26 + 78 + 51 + 61 + 23 + 26 + 29 + 17 = 311
   - Agent 1: 67 + 96 + 71 + 97 + 43 + 79 + 74 + 98 = 625
   - Agent 2: 98 + 20 + 68 + 66 + 21 + 47 + 91 + 86 = 497
   - Agent 3: 23 + 96 + 63 + 48 + 55 + 60 + 61 + 26 = 432

2. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate each agent the items where they have the highest valuation, ensuring each item is only allocated once.

   - Agent 0: Start with item 1 (78)
   - Agent 1: Start with item 3 (97)
   - Agent 2: Start with item 0 (98)
   - Agent 3: Start with item 4 (55)

3. **Further Allocation**: Allocate remaining items by considering the next highest valuations.

   - Agent 0: (78) + 51 (item 2)
   - Agent 1: (97) + 98 (item 7)
   - Agent 2: (98) + 91 (item 6)
   - Agent 3: (55) + 96 (item 1) [already allocated to Agent 0], so 60 (item 5)

4. **Final Allocation**: Adjust to ensure all 8 items are distributed.

   - Agent 0: 2 items (1, 2)
   - Agent 1: 2 items (3, 7)
   - Agent 2: 2 items (0, 6)
   - Agent 3: 2 items (4, 5)

5. **Convert to JSON Format**:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, which is fair given there are 8 items and 4 agents. Each agent receives items that maximize their valuations from the available items, aiming for a fair division based on their preferences.
