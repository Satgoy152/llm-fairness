Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  28  67  60  72  37  53   2
1  37  95  32  10  10  16  83  61
2  77   4  86  20   7   5  74  86
3  39  38  32  11  43  63  60  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets approximately the same total value from the items they receive, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 37 + 28 + 67 + 60 + 72 + 37 + 53 + 2 = 356
   - Agent 1: 37 + 95 + 32 + 10 + 10 + 16 + 83 + 61 = 344
   - Agent 2: 77 + 4 + 86 + 20 + 7 + 5 + 74 + 86 = 359
   - Agent 3: 39 + 38 + 32 + 11 + 43 + 63 + 60 + 30 = 316

2. Aim to distribute the items such that the value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

3. Consider the maximum valuation each agent has for the items, and allocate accordingly to balance the total value received by each agent.

The following allocation achieves a reasonably fair distribution:

- Agent 0: [4, 6] (Values: 72, 53; Total Value: 125)
- Agent 1: [1, 5] (Values: 95, 16; Total Value: 111)
- Agent 2: [2, 7] (Values: 86, 86; Total Value: 172)
- Agent 3: [0, 3] (Values: 39, 11; Total Value: 50)

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
