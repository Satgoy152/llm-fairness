Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  57  14  13  33  60  83  37
1  63  66  81   5  17  36  21   0
2  78  96  87  41  45  71  93  52
3  11  10  97  31  44  70  86  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. We will aim to ensure that each agent has an approximately equal opportunity to receive items they value highly. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate them first.**
2. **Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.**
3. **Try to balance the total value received by each agent to ensure fairness.**

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0's highest values**: Item 6 (83), Item 5 (60)
- **Agent 1's highest values**: Item 2 (81), Item 1 (66)
- **Agent 2's highest values**: Item 1 (96), Item 6 (93)
- **Agent 3's highest values**: Item 2 (97), Item 7 (93)

Given these preferences, we can allocate items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 6 (83)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 2 (81)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 (96)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 7 (93)

Now, we must ensure all items are allocated:

- **Remaining items**: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Allocate these remaining items considering agents' next preferences and ensuring all agents have at least one item.

Continuing with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Add Item 5 (60)
- **Agent 1**: Add Item 0 (63)
- **Agent 2**: Add Item 3 (41)
- **Agent 3**: Add Item 4 (44)

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and attempts to maximize their total value from the allocation.
