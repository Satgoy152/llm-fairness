Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  35  46  33  11  44  37  22
1  56  16  11  89  54  73   8  40
2  37  41  56  27  38  12   7  23
3  66  14  10  23  62  97   8  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that the agents receive items they value highly, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (46), Item 5 (44)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (89), Item 5 (73)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (56), Item 1 (41)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (97), Item 7 (89)

Let's begin by allocating the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring fairness and trying to maximize the total value each agent receives.

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 3 (highest valuation by any agent).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (this item has the highest valuation by Agent 1).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation by Agent 0 and second highest by Agent 2; Agent 0 is chosen because Agent 2 has more options).
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 3 (second highest valuation by Agent 3).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 3 (due to relatively high valuation by Agent 3 and limited options left for other items).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation by Agent 2).
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 has fewer items).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 has limited options left).

Now, let's represent the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 7, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations.
