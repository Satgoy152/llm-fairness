Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  81  61  93  48  12  68  62
1  20  83   5  70  17  77  90   8
2  26  62   1  95  87  84   9  85
3  31  52  37  22  31  36  60  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. Given there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items to maintain fairness.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (93), 1 (81)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (90), 5 (77)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (95), 7 (85)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 7 (96), 6 (60)

We need to ensure each item is only allocated once and each agent receives a fair share. Let's adjust the allocations considering the highest priorities and fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 (79), 1 (81)
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 (77), 6 (90)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 (95), 7 (85)
- **Agent 3**: Items 2 (37), 4 (31)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and attempts to balance the overall valuation based on the highest individual preferences.
