Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  87  52  74  14   5  97  88
1  93  69  13  28  19  20   9  86
2  28   7  93  98  50  51  90   1
3   3  19  68  99   8  93  33  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the 8 items among the 4 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally get 2 items. We will consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Values: [95, 87, 52, 74, 14, 5, 97, 88]
   - Highest values are for items 0 and 6.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [93, 69, 13, 28, 19, 20, 9, 86]
   - Highest values are for items 0 and 7, but item 0 is taken, so we choose items 1 and 7.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [28, 7, 93, 98, 50, 51, 90, 1]
   - Highest values are for items 2 and 3.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [3, 19, 68, 99, 8, 93, 33, 38]
   - Highest values are for items 3 and 5, but item 3 is taken, so we choose items 5 and 6.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets 2 items and no item is assigned to more than one agent:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 6
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 7
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 3: Items 4 and 5

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents with each agent getting 2 items.
