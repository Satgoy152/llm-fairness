Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  65  49   3  59  62  36  14
1   9  52  68  38  69  80  63  48
2  32  68   4  45  42  17  26  36
3  71  60  73  74  92  58  27  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a heuristic approach that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. This is similar to solving an assignment problem where the goal is to distribute items to agents such that the total value is maximized. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **List all items and their values for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [90, 65, 49, 3, 59, 62, 36, 14]
   - Agent 1: [9, 52, 68, 38, 69, 80, 63, 48]
   - Agent 2: [32, 68, 4, 45, 42, 17, 26, 36]
   - Agent 3: [71, 60, 73, 74, 92, 58, 27, 57]

2. **Assign items to agents:**

   - We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Allocation:**

   - Item 0: Maximum value by Agent 0 (90)
   - Item 1: Maximum value by Agent 2 (68)
   - Item 2: Maximum value by Agent 3 (73)
   - Item 3: Maximum value by Agent 3 (74)
   - Item 4: Maximum value by Agent 3 (92)
   - Item 5: Maximum value by Agent 1 (80)
   - Item 6: Maximum value by Agent 1 (63)
   - Item 7: Maximum value by Agent 1 (48)

4. **Compile the results:**

   Based on the allocations above, we distribute the items as follows:

   - Agent 0: [0]
   - Agent 1: [5, 6, 7]
   - Agent 2: [1]
   - Agent 3: [2, 3, 4]

5. **JSON format:**

   ```json
   {
       "0": [0],
       "1": [5, 6, 7],
       "2": [1],
       "3": [2, 3, 4]
   }
   ```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, thereby maximizing their satisfaction with the allocation.
