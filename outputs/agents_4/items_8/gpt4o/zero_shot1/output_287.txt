Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  82  95  34  50  79  91  41
1  25  99  74  96  99  25  37   3
2  80  76   6  85  71  80   1  81
3  22  47  40  55  67  49  61  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible, to keep the allocation fair). However, since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. Let's try to distribute the items based on maximizing their valuations while keeping the allocation balanced.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (95) and Item 6 (91)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (99) and Item 4 (99)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (80) and Item 7 (81)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Remaining items: Item 0 (22) and Item 3 (55)

This allocation ensures each agent gets 2 items, and the distribution attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
