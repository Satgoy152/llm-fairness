Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  35  62  44  27  81  32  96
1  52   3  31  63   6   8  82  21
2  60  89  11  87  54   8  52  48
3  17  26  11  65  55  46  27  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction (valuation) for fairness.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each agent:** This helps in ensuring each agent gets an item they highly value. However, we must also ensure no item is allocated twice.

2. **Allocate items to maximize total satisfaction:** For each agent, try to assign items that are not only highly valued by them but also less valued by other agents if possible. This step ensures that each agent gets a fair chance at high-value items.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated:** Distribute remaining items such that the overall satisfaction across all agents is balanced.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** The highest valuation is for item 0 (99), and item 7 (96). We allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** The highest valuation is for item 6 (82), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** The highest valuation is for item 1 (89), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** The highest valuation is for item 3 (65), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. Let's allocate the remaining 4 items:

- **Remaining items:** 2, 4, 5, 7.
- **Agent 0:** Among remaining items, item 7 has a high valuation (96) for Agent 0, so allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Remaining items are 2, 4, 5. The highest valuation for Agent 1 among these is item 2 (31), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Remaining items are 4, 5. Agent 2 values item 4 at 54 and item 5 at 8. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** The only remaining item is 5, which will be allocated to Agent 3.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
