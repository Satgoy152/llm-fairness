Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  49  84  35  95  82  42  28
1   4  60  84  43  83  47  18  18
2  65  20   6  17  69  24  34  72
3  17  45  24  93  90  55   2  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we want to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable number of items while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations. Given that there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should receive approximately 2 items. We'll prioritize allocations to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive.

Let's consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to distribute them evenly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 4 and 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 2 and 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 0 and 7.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 3 and 4.

Considering these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 7
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6

This allocation ensures each agent gets 2 items, and it maximizes each agent's value based on their preferences.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
