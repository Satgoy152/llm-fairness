Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  31  97   9  46  18  97  59
1  43  85  53  90  17   3  70  23
2  24  28  79  36  93  17  24   7
3  82  92  42  45  77  49  37  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (since there are 4 agents and 8 items). We also need to ensure that the allocations are as balanced as possible regarding the number of items each agent receives.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high values for items 0 and 2. Allocating these items would maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has high value for item 3. Allocating it would ensure a good match.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has the highest value for item 4, so we can allocate it to them.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has high values for items 1 and 7. Allocating these items would maximize their satisfaction.

Now let's check the allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 5, 6, 7]

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent has a fair share of items based on their valuations. Now, let's format this in the required JSON structure:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
