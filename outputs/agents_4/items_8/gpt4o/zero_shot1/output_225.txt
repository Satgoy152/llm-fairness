Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0   9  65   9  57   1  97  12
1  50  90  86   5  74  54  26  50
2   6  21  25  54   4  40  86  19
3  25  36  94  94  84  40   7  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. We aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by ensuring each agent gets items they value highly while ensuring all items are allocated.

First, let's look at the highest value each agent has for any item:
- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 97.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 90.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest at 86.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 94.

Given this information, we can start by allocating items based on these high values and then adjust for fairness and completeness:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 90).
2. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 97) and item 2 to Agent 3 (value 94).
3. Agent 2 can be allocated item 5 (value 40) since item 6 is already taken.

Now, let's complete the allocation:

- Agent 0 also values item 4 (57) after item 6. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 can take item 7 (value 50) since it's one of their higher remaining values.
- Agent 2 can take item 3 (value 54).
- Agent 3 can take item 0 (value 25).

The allocation ensures each agent gets items they value relatively highly, and all items are distributed.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation considers both the individual valuations and aims to distribute items fairly among the agents.
