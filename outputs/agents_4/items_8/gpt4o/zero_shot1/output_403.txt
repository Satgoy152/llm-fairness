Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  88  53   0  37  35   9  20
1  86   3  61  89  88  22  79   3
2  86  51  71  92  87   6  99  85
3  93  71  56  29  26  28  85  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering that each agent should get at least one item, if possible. Given the valuations, we can consider various allocation strategies. One possible approach is to allocate items in a way that attempts to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's start by analyzing the highest value each agent has for any item, then proceed to allocate based on these preferences, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for item 1 (88), item 2 (53), and item 4 (37).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations are for item 3 (89), item 4 (88), and item 0 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations are for item 6 (99), item 3 (92), and item 4 (87).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuations are for item 0 (93), item 1 (71), and item 6 (85).

Now, let's allocate based on these preferences:

- **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 0, so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3** is highly valued by Agent 1, so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 6** is highly valued by Agent 2, so allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 0** is highly valued by Agent 3, so allocate to Agent 3.

Continuing with the remaining items:

- **Item 4**: It's highly valued by Agent 1 and Agent 2. Since Agent 1 has only one item, allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 0, who values it the most from the remaining items.
- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 3, who values it after item 0.
- **Item 7**: Allocate to Agent 2, who values it after item 6.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation preferences, and all 8 items are distributed.
