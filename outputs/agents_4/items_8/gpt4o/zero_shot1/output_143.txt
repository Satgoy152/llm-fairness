Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  80  77  12  51  98  74  16
1  85  93  21  45   0  82  22  43
2   3  87  60   3  82  71  46  91
3  77   3   3  78  19  62  53  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we aim to distribute the items based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 85 by agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 93 by agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 77 by agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 78 by agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 82 by agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 98 by agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 74 by agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 91 by agent 2.

Based on this allocation of items to agents, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 3: Item [3]

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and every agent gets at least one item. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [3]
}
```
