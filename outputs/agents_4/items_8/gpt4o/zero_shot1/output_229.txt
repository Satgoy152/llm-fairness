Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  62  35  40  29  26  86  55
1  59  13  83  95  48  29  38  96
2  59  91  75  72  30   3  17  49
3  83  60  41  61  33  17  84  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives approximately the same total value from the items they receive. This is a problem of fair division, and one approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction among the agents.

Let's start by evaluating the total value each agent would receive if they were given certain items. 

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
   - Values: 79, 62, 35, 40, 29, 26, 86, 55

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
   - Values: 59, 13, 83, 95, 48, 29, 38, 96

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
   - Values: 59, 91, 75, 72, 30, 3, 17, 49

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
   - Values: 83, 60, 41, 61, 33, 17, 84, 48

Let's try to allocate items to balance the total value for each agent. Here is a possible allocation:

- Allocate items in such a way that the total value is approximately balanced across all agents:

    - Agent 0: [0, 6]
      - Total value = 79 + 86 = 165
    - Agent 1: [3, 7]
      - Total value = 95 + 96 = 191
    - Agent 2: [1, 2]
      - Total value = 91 + 75 = 166
    - Agent 3: [4, 5]
      - Total value = 33 + 17 = 50

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total values received by each agent as much as possible.
