Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  90  11  88  61  16  14  97
1  70   3  39   7  99  61  76  54
2  96  18  89  74  76  93  14  49
3   1  73  22  30  55  91  64  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items such that all items are allocated. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are items 1 (90) and 7 (97). 
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 4 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value items for Agent 2 are items 0 (96), 2 (89), and 5 (93).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 5 (91), but since item 5 is already allocated, we allocate item 1 (73).

Now let's allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (96)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (90)
- Item 2: Agent 2 (89)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (88)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (99)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (93)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (76)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (97)

Now let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 5],
    "3": []
}
```
