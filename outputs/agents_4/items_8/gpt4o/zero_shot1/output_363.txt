Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  71  89  29  18  82  62  57
1  97  13  38  25  35  21  79  73
2  46  93  91  29  90  79  74  74
3  59  79  30  21  30  65  85  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 71 89 29 18 82 62 57]
 [97 13 38 25 35 21 79 73]

 [59 79 30 21 30 65 85 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by sorting the valuations in descending order for each item and select the highest valuation for allocation.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: The highest value is 97 by agent 1.
2. Item 1: The highest value is 93 by agent 2.
3. Item 2: The highest value is 91 by agent 2.
4. Item 3: The highest value is 29 by agent 0 or agent 2. Assign to agent 0 for diversity.
5. Item 4: The highest value is 90 by agent 2.
6. Item 5: The highest value is 82 by agent 0.
7. Item 6: The highest value is 85 by agent 3.
8. Item 7: The highest value is 74 by agent 2.

Now, let's organize these allocations:

- Agent 0: [3, 5]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1, 2, 4, 7]
- Agent 3: [6]

All items have been allocated, and each agent has received at least one item.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 7],
    "3": [6]
}
```
