Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  28  49  97  69  62  78  47
1  93  40  22  84  19  81  27  85
2  66  19  37  15  62  15  83  28
3  26  98  11  19  60  18  70  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction for all agents while ensuring that every agent gets an integer number of items. This can be done using various algorithms, but here we'll manually balance the allocations based on the given valuations.

Let's first analyze the valuations for each agent to determine the potential best fit between agents and items:

- **Agent 0**: Prefers item 3 (97), followed by item 6 (78).
- **Agent 1**: Prefers item 0 (93), followed by item 7 (85).
- **Agent 2**: Prefers item 6 (83), followed by item 0 (66).
- **Agent 3**: Prefers item 1 (98), followed by item 7 (79).

We aim to allocate items such that we maximize individual agent satisfaction based on their preferences while ensuring all items are assigned.

Based on preferences and valuations:
1. **Agent 0** gets item 3 (97) and item 6 (78).
2. **Agent 1** gets item 0 (93) and item 7 (85).
3. **Agent 2** gets item 5 (15) and item 2 (37).
4. **Agent 3** gets item 1 (98) and item 4 (60).

Each agent receives two items, maintaining balance and satisfying their top preferences as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
