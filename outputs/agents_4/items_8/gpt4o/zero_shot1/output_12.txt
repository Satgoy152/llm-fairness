Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  72  95  92  25  19  80  82
1  46  34  75  98  65  93  27  35
2  40  85  54  41  50  86  33  47
3  35  85  19  26  50  73  54  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items so that each agent receives a balanced share according to their preferences. Given that there are 8 items and 4 agents, ideally each agent should receive 2 items. We will aim for such a distribution while considering the agents' valuations.

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the valuations, Agent 0 values items 2 (95) and 3 (92) the highest.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values items 5 (93) and 3 (98) the most. Since item 3 is already taken by Agent 0, we assign item 5 to Agent 1. The next highest is item 4 (65).
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 (85) and item 5 (86) the highest. Since item 5 is already taken, we assign item 1 to Agent 2. The next highest available is item 7 (47).
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 (85) and item 5 (73) the highest. With these items taken, we assign item 0 (35) and item 6 (54).

Here is the allocation based on the above reasoning:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with each agent getting two items.
