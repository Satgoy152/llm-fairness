Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  54   6  61  11  83  47  77
1  77  41  19  20  67  66  64  54
2  78  72  35  32  90  62  64   0
3  67  93  17  74  80  69   1  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, since there are 8 items and 4 agents.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items that give the highest value to Agent 0 compared to other agents. Agent 0 values item 5 most highly at 83, so we assign item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Next, consider Agent 1. The item valued highest by Agent 1 that hasn't been assigned is item 0, with a value of 77.

3. **Agent 2**: For Agent 2, the highest value is for item 4 at 90, so we assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 93, so we assign item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items**: Now, we have items 2, 3, 6, and 7 left. We continue assigning based on the highest remaining values for each agent.

   - Agent 0: The highest value for the remaining items is for item 7 with a value of 77.
   - Agent 1: The highest value for the remaining items is for item 6 with a value of 64.
   - Agent 2: The highest value for the remaining items is for item 3 with a value of 32.
   - Agent 3: The last remaining item, item 2, is assigned to Agent 3.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the overall distribution aims to maximize the total value for each agent based on the given valuations.
