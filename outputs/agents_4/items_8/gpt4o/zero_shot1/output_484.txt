Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  70  47  93  40  98  53  69
1  71  93  56  93   5  89  56  16
2  38  86  10  94  33  83  45  76
3   8  82  56  37  12  66  40  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction across all agents. One common method is to use a "greedy" allocation, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's assign each item to the agent who values it highest:

- Item 0: Valuations are (7, 71, 38, 8). Highest: Agent 1.
- Item 1: Valuations are (70, 93, 86, 82). Highest: Agent 1.
- Item 2: Valuations are (47, 56, 10, 56). Highest: Agent 1 (tie, but we'll allocate to the first one).
- Item 3: Valuations are (93, 93, 94, 37). Highest: Agent 2.
- Item 4: Valuations are (40, 5, 33, 12). Highest: Agent 0.
- Item 5: Valuations are (98, 89, 83, 66). Highest: Agent 0.
- Item 6: Valuations are (53, 56, 45, 40). Highest: Agent 1.
- Item 7: Valuations are (69, 16, 76, 57). Highest: Agent 2.

Now let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:

Agent 0: Initially has items 4, 5.
Agent 1: Initially has items 0, 1, 2, 6.
Agent 2: Initially has items 3, 7.
Agent 3: Initially has no items.

We have allocated all 8 items, and each agent has an integer number of items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": []
}
```
