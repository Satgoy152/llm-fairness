Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  57  86  57  54  49  65   8
1  79  72   7  29  95  78  12  22
2  20  32  28  66  77  33  31  47
3  13  33  94  21  19  41  91  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent feels they receive a satisfactory value. One approach is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item that they highly value, and the remaining items are distributed to balance the overall satisfaction. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (value 86).
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (value 95).
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 (value 77), but since it's already allocated, we'll consider item 3 (value 66).
- Agent 3 highly values item 2 (value 94), but since it's already allocated, we'll consider item 6 (value 91).

Now to complete the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items [0, 1] to Agent 0. This gives them values [34, 57].
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items [4, 5] to Agent 1. This gives them values [95, 78].
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items [3, 7] to Agent 2. This gives them values [66, 47].
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items [2, 6] to Agent 3. This gives them values [94, 91].

In total, each agent receives 2 items, and all 8 items are allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```
