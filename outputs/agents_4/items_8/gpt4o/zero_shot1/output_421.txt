Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  99   1  13  61  29  11  55
1   9  41  38  18  78  58  21  60
2  93   6  73  37  18  29  47  57
3  67  26  47  19  19  18  56  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to make sure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations to distribute the items:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (99) and item 4 second most (61).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (78) and item 7 second most (60).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (93) and item 2 second most (73).
- Agent 3 values item 0 second most (67) and item 6 the most (56).

A possible allocation strategy is to assign items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest.
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 3, as they value it the most.
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as they have the next highest valuation for it.
6. Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as they have the next highest valuation for it.
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as they value it fairly well.
8. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they have a reasonable valuation for it.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 7, 5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items based on valuations while ensuring that all agents receive at least one item and all items are allocated.
