Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  57  46  89  80  46  30   3
1  45  71  50  51  70  59   5  13
2  60  94  70  55  50  99  48  39
3  31  61  76  95  80  49  11   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. One approach is to assign items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with the highest value for Agent 0 are: 3 (89), 4 (80), and 1 (57).
   - Assign items: 3, 4, and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items with the highest value for Agent 1 are: 1 (71), 4 (70), and 5 (59).
   - Since item 1 and 4 are already assigned, assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items with the highest value for Agent 2 are: 5 (99), 1 (94), and 2 (70).
   - Since item 5 is already assigned, assign items: 0 (60) and 2 (70) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items with the highest value for Agent 3 are: 3 (95), 2 (76), and 4 (80).
   - Since items 2, 3, and 4 are already assigned, assign items: 6 (11) and 7 (5) to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```
