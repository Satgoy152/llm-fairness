Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  41  33  27  28  82  47  35
1   4  79  95  15  80  95  36  40
2  91   8  63  92  82  25  58  21
3  75  35  21  95  88  66  40  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents. One way to do this is by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring that each agent gets a fair share while maximizing their total value.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (82), Item 0 (43)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (95), Item 5 (95), Item 4 (80)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (92), Item 0 (91), Item 4 (82)
   
4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (95), Item 4 (88)

Now, let's begin the allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Allocate Item 5 (82) as it's their highest value and doesn't conflict with other agents' highest choices.
  - Allocate Item 0 (43).

- **Agent 1:**
  - Allocate Item 2 (95) as it doesn't conflict with other agents' highest choices.
  - Allocate Item 4 (80) as it also is a high value for Agent 1 and available.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Allocate Item 3 (92), as it is a high value and does not conflict anymore since Agent 3 has other options.
  - Allocate Item 6 (58), which is a good choice after the top values are considered.

- **Agent 3:**
  - Allocate Item 1 (35) and Item 7 (66) as these are the highest remaining values available for Agent 3.

Finally, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items with reasonable value based on their preferences.
