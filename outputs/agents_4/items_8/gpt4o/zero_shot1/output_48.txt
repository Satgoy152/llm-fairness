Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66   5  27  52  41  40  11   3
1  24  16  73  86  84  64  74  60
2  59   9  56  75  99  18  77  39
3  48  72  27  65   2  18  13   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We also need to ensure that all items are allocated and that no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Let's begin by examining the highest values for each agent and try to allocate items based on maximizing their satisfaction while maintaining a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: 66 (Item 0), 52 (Item 3)
   - Let's allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: 86 (Item 3), 84 (Item 4), 74 (Item 6)
   - Let's allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: 99 (Item 4), 77 (Item 6), 75 (Item 3)
   - Let's allocate Item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: 72 (Item 1), 65 (Item 3)
   - Let's allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have already allocated Items 0, 1, 4, and 6. We need to allocate the remaining items: 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Continuing with allocation:

5. **Agent 0** (after initial allocation):
   - Remaining high value: 52 (Item 3)
   - Let's allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1** (after initial allocation):
   - Remaining high value: 64 (Item 5)
   - Let's allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2** (after initial allocation):
   - Remaining high value: 56 (Item 2)
   - Let's allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3** (after initial allocation):
   - Remaining high value: 39 (Item 7)
   - Let's allocate Item 7 to Agent 3.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
