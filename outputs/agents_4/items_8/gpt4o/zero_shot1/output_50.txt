Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  27  37  28  33  33  64  53
1  87  81  86  66  27  47  71  56
2  23  51  51  16  40  54  79  78
3   7  35   9  80   7  29  16  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Additionally, each item must be allocated to only one agent, and a total of 8 items must be distributed.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [27, 27, 37, 28, 33, 33, 64, 53]
Agent 1: [87, 81, 86, 66, 27, 47, 71, 56]
Agent 2: [23, 51, 51, 16, 40, 54, 79, 78]
Agent 3: [7, 35, 9, 80, 7, 29, 16, 60]
```

We will focus on maximizing the total valuation for each agent, considering each agent's preferences.

A possible allocation that considers these constraints might look like this:

- Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5, 6, and 7.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3.

Considering the above, here's a possible allocation:

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate items 5 and 7 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [3]
}
```
