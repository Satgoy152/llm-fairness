Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  12   4  24  69  21  39  99
1  66  24  44  30  69  35  88   7
2  89  40  25  30  84  38  67  34
3  73  16  62  19  99   1  91  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. Given there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally be allocated 2 items.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 7 (91 and 99). Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their total value.

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 6 (69 and 88). Allocating these items to Agent 1 maximizes their total value.

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0 and 4 (89 and 84) but since these items are already taken, the next best available items are 5 and 6, but item 6 is taken, so we allocate items 2 and 5 (25 and 38) for a reasonable valuation.

4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 4 and 6 but since these are taken, we allocate items 2 and 3 (62 and 19), which are still available and provide a decent valuation for Agent 3.

Considering the allocations to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring all items are distributed, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 3]

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
