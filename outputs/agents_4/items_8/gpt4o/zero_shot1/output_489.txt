Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  30  63  17  72  24  73   2
1  97  10  34  79  72  44  83  32
2  61  86  24  53  93  94  74  87
3  31  22  74  62  25  48  97   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: Start by identifying the highest values each agent has for the items, as this will maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

3. **Adjust for Balance**: If some agents end up with significantly more or fewer items, adjust the allocation to ensure each agent has roughly the same number of items.

Let's consider the allocations based on the given table:

- Agent 0 values item 6 highly (73).
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (97).
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly (93).
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly (97).

We will allocate by assigning the highest-valued items first, then distribute remaining items to balance the allocations:

### Allocation Steps:
- **Agent 0**: Item 6 (value = 73)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value = 97)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value = 93)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (value = 74)

Remaining items to allocate: 1, 3, 5, 7.

- **Agent 0**: Item 5 (value = 24)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value = 79)
- **Agent 2**: Item 7 (value = 87)
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value = 22)

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of the total 8 items.
