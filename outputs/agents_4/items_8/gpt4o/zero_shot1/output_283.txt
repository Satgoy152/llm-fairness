Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  11  97  30  41  58  70  33
1  49  70  40  20  89  25  54  62
2  31  12  28  12  92  30  45  17
3  30  82  33  11  59  24  57  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the preferences (valuations) of each agent for the items and ensure that each agent receives at least one item while maximizing total satisfaction. We will use a simple strategy, trying to maximize the value each agent gets while ensuring all items are allocated.

Below is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Assign the highest-valued item to each agent first, if possible:**
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (97)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (89)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (92), but item 4 is already taken, so next highest is Item 6 (45)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (82)

2. **Allocate remaining items by considering the next highest-valued items for each agent without conflicts:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 3, 5, 7
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (80)
   - Agent 1: Item 7 (62)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (30)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 (11)

Now, each agent has received two items, and all items have been allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their preferences.
