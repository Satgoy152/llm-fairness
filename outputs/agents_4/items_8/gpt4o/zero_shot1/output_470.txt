Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  97  74  81  81  54   7  51
1  34   7  42   0  52  52  69  13
2  58  90  69  28  55  29   9  16
3  67  15  85  30  23  91  11  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will attempt to maximize each agent's happiness by giving them items they value highly. At the same time, we need to ensure that all 8 items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's go through a potential allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (97), 3 (81), 4 (81).
   - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (69), 0 (34).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (90), 0 (58).
   - Allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (91), 2 (85).
   - Allocate items 2 and 5 to Agent 3.

Now, check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [1, 3]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [2, 5]

However, we notice that item 5 is allocated twice; hence, we need to adjust this allocation to meet the condition of unique allocation per item.

Re-evaluate considering the highest remaining unallocated values:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items 1, 3 are already allocated.
   - Allocate item 4 (81) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 6 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 7 (13) to Agent 1 for better distribution.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 0 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 5 (29) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items 2 and 5 are already allocated.
   - Allocate item 2 (85) to Agent 3.

Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated uniquely and each agent receives an integer number of items.
