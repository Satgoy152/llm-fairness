Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  94   6  87  96  85  67  73
1  30  44  24  90  98  58  16  81
2  58  15   7  29  10  56  35   3
3  53  81  60  73  89  75  32  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Additionally, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (96), followed by item 1 (94). We can allocate these two items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (98), but since it is already assigned to Agent 0, we allocate item 3 (90), which is the highest remaining value for Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 doesn't have very high valuations, but item 5 (56) is the highest for Agent 2. We allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for several items; item 1 (81) is the highest remaining value, but since it is allocated, we choose items 0 (53) and 3 (73) for Agent 3.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, maximizing each agent's potential satisfaction based on the given valuations.
