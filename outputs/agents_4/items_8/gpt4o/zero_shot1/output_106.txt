Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  22  80  47  97  25  93  86
1  96  85  77  35  63  27  21  75
2  16  37  22  72  31  64  24   1
3   7  39  49  26  56   3  74  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction or total value for each agent. We start by analyzing the values each agent assigns to each item and try to assign items in a way that maximizes the agents' satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (given that there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent can theoretically receive 2 items).

Here is a way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 4, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has high values for items 0, 1, and 2.
3. **Agent 2** has a decent value for item 5.
4. **Agent 3** can be given items that are left, but with better value for them.

Let's start by assigning the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value = 96, highest for item 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value = 80, highest for item 2).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value = 97, highest for item 4).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value = 93, highest for item 6).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value = 85, highest for item 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value = 72, highest for item 3).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value = 64, highest for item 5).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value = 75, highest remaining for item 7).

This allocation maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": []
}
```

Each agent has been allocated items in a way that attempts to maximize their valuation based on the given constraints.
