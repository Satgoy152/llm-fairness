Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  89  65  70  89  32  20  49
1  10   7  90  36  49   2   1   8
2  42  37  10  45  13  24  46  44
3   4  76  26  92  94  87  89  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by the agents and try to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (42)
   - Assign to Agent 2
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (89)
   - Assign to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (90)
   - Assign to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (92)
   - Assign to Agent 3

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (94)
   - Assign to Agent 3

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (87)
   - Assign to Agent 3

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (89)
   - Assign to Agent 3

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (53)
   - Assign to Agent 3

Now, let's verify the allocation to ensure each agent has a fair share:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Agent 3 ends up with more items, but they highly value each of these items. This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent given their preferences.

Finally, here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
