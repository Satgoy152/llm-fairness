Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  35  54  40  80  34  77   5
1   8  70  90  43  77  91  96  18
2  32  13  82  58  32  87  48   9
3  24  99  20  16  76  36  81  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate items by considering each agent's highest-valued items first, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest-valued items: Item 0 (95), Item 4 (80)
   - Allocate: Item 0, Item 4

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest-valued items: Item 6 (96), Item 5 (91), Item 2 (90)
   - Allocate: Item 2, Item 5

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest-valued items: Item 5 (87), Item 2 (82), Item 3 (58)
   - Allocate: Item 3

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest-valued items: Item 1 (99), Item 4 (76)
   - Allocate: Item 1, Item 6, Item 7

Let's check the allocation to ensure all 8 items are fairly distributed and no item is allocated more than once:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 1, 6, 7

This distribution gives agents a relatively fair share based on their preferences, considering both their highest-valued items and a balance in the number of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 6, 7]
}
```
