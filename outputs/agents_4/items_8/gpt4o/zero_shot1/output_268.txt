Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  97  94  63  56  20   1  88
1  25  63  90  53  97  53  60  62
2  99  53  96  95  77  56  69  70
3  52   5   8  34  15  68  70  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this:

1. **Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Sum up the values each agent assigns to all items to get an idea of which agent values items more highly overall.

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Value:** Start by giving each agent the item they value the most. Continue assigning items one by one to the agent who values the remaining items most highly until all items are allocated.

3. **Ensure Fairness:** We should also ensure that each agent receives items, keeping in mind their total valuation capacity.

Let's go through this process:

- **Agent 0 Total Valuation:** 474
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation:** 503
- **Agent 2 Total Valuation:** 615
- **Agent 3 Total Valuation:** 321

Now, allocate the items:

- Give item 0 to Agent 2 (value = 99, highest among agents).
- Give item 1 to Agent 0 (value = 97, highest among agents).
- Give item 2 to Agent 2 (value = 96, highest among agents).
- Give item 3 to Agent 2 (value = 95, highest among agents).
- Give item 4 to Agent 1 (value = 97, highest among agents).
- Give item 5 to Agent 3 (value = 68, highest among agents).
- Give item 6 to Agent 3 (value = 70, highest among agents).
- Give item 7 to Agent 0 (value = 88, highest among agents).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent's preference is considered in the allocation.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2, 3],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with their highest-valued items while ensuring all items are allocated.
