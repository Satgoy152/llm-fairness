Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  71  45  71  12  58  76  31
1  77  12   6   6  52  68  21   8
2  77  81  11  62  54  11  72  99
3  63  46  72  61  28   7  81  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should strive for a distribution that maximizes the total value perceived by each agent. This can be done by calculating which items are most valued by each agent and attempting to distribute them in a way that balances overall satisfaction. Here's a step-by-step process for such an allocation:

1. **List High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Identify which items are valued more by each agent.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Begin by allocating the highest value item to each agent.
3. **Balance the Allocation**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while maintaining fairness in terms of total value received.

Let's analyze and allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are in items 6 (76) and 3 (71).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is in item 0 (77).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are in item 7 (99) and 1 (81).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is in item 6 (81).

To balance:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value of 81).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (value of 99).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value of 77).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value of 81).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value of 71).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value of 68).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value of 54).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value of 72).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 4, 7],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and agents receive a fair distribution of items based on their preferences.
