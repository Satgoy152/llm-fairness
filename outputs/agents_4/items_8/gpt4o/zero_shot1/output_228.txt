Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  48   6  49  14  63  36  73
1  43  16  39  79  56  75  51   0
2  77  85  22  30  87  21   6  67
3  23   1  85  86  47  44  85  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize their satisfaction. The goal is to distribute all 8 items among the 4 agents such that each agent receives at least some value, and the total distribution is fair and balanced.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest valued items for each agent and allocate them accordingly to maximize their satisfaction.
2. Attempt to distribute the remaining items in a way that doesn't leave any agent with zero items, if possible.

Let's go through the process:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 7 (value 73) and item 5 (value 63).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (value 79) and item 5 (value 75).
- **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (value 87) and item 1 (value 85).
- **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (value 85) and item 3 (value 86).

Now, let's allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's value:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0: This is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1: This is one of their highest valued items.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2: This is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3: This is one of their highest valued items.

At this point, each agent has one item. Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- For Agent 0, assign item 0: The next highest valued item for Agent 0.
- For Agent 1, assign item 3: Another high valued item for Agent 1.
- For Agent 2, assign item 1: Another high valued item for Agent 2.
- For Agent 3, assign item 6: To give Agent 3 a second item and balance the allocation.

This leads to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with high personal value, and all 8 items are distributed fairly among the agents.
