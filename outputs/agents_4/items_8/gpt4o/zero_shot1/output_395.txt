Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  13  58  67  90  57   9  88
1  88  25  96  60  44  25  92  35
2  69  19  83  48  28  95  16  77
3  82  70  21  33  98   7  66  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s one approach to do this:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for any item.
2. Assign items to the agents based on these highest values while ensuring no item is assigned more than once.
3. Attempt to balance the allocation by considering the next highest values for agents who haven't been assigned any items yet or have fewer items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Start with the highest values for each agent:
  - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 90)
  - Agent 1: Item 2 (value 96)
  - Agent 2: Item 5 (value 95)
  - Agent 3: Item 4 (value 98) - already taken by Agent 0

- Allocate the next highest available values:
  - Agent 3: Item 0 (value 82)

- Continue to allocate remaining items to balance the distribution:
  - Agent 0: Item 7 (value 88)
  - Agent 1: Item 6 (value 92)
  - Agent 2: Item 3 (value 48)
  - Agent 3: Item 1 (value 70)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

Thus, each agent has a fair distribution of items based on their valuations.
