Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32   5  40  62  58  21  69  83
1  20  18  37  25  38  90   8   2
2  40  98   9  71   2  60  51  65
3  87   9  98  48  32  33  67  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32  5 40 62 58 21 69 83]
 [20 18 37 25 38 90  8  2]
 [40 98  9 71  2 60 51 65]
 [87  9 98 48 32 33 67 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total value for each agent, we can use a "greedy" approach. This strategy involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how it would work:

1. Analyze the valuation table to determine which agent values each item the most.
2. Assign each item to the respective agent who has the highest valuation for it.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 87, which is the highest.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 98, which is the highest.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it at 98, which is the highest.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 71, which is the highest.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 58, which is the highest.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 90, which is the highest.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 69, which is the highest.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 83, which is the highest.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

In these allocations, each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are fairly distributed based on their highest valuations.
