Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72   4  53  39  61  83  91  37
1  21  50  43  10  98  73  21   0
2  45  62  17  37  58  68   0  75
3  34  13  93  25  80  49   0  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can apply a method that considers the preferences of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an equal or nearly equal number of items. Let's allocate the items by trying to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive, while also ensuring an approximately equal distribution of the number of items each agent gets.

Since there are 4 agents and 8 items, ideally each agent should receive 2 items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
    - Item 6: Value 91
    - Item 0: Value 72

2. Agent 1:
    - Item 4: Value 98
    - Item 5: Value 73

3. Agent 2:
    - Item 7: Value 75
    - Item 1: Value 62

4. Agent 3:
    - Item 3: Value 25
    - Item 2: Value 93

This allocation gives each agent two items, and the items are distributed in a way that maximizes the value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
