Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  78   8  62  12  83  99   2
1   0  31  24  93  53  84  83  40
2   6  35  16  41  91  74  51  12
3  51  12  81  22  54  31  67  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on the given valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We will look for allocations that consider both the value an agent places on an item and the need to distribute items evenly when possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the highest valued item for each agent to ensure they get at least one item they value highly.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the number of items each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Item 6 (99 is the highest value for Agent 0)
2. Agent 1: Item 3 (93 is the highest value for Agent 1)
3. Agent 2: Item 4 (91 is the highest value for Agent 2)
4. Agent 3: Item 2 (81 is the highest value for Agent 3)

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining 4 items:

5. Agent 0: Item 5 (83 is the next highest value for Agent 0)
6. Agent 1: Item 5 is already taken, so allocate Item 7 (40 is next highest and available)
7. Agent 2: Item 1 (35 is the next highest value for Agent 2)
8. Agent 3: Item 0 (51 is the next highest value for Agent 3)

This allocation gives each agent 2 items, and we have distributed all 8 items. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [2, 0]
}
```
