Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  52  40  33  26  11  58  34
1  55  99  77   8  21  16  24  59
2  38  70  77   3  53  95  43  96
3  13  66  92  37  97  85  13  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable distribution based on their valuations and that all the items are allocated. One approach is to calculate the maximum value each agent has for the items and prioritize giving them those items, ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Let's work through the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 6 (58) and 1 (52).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 1 (99) and 2 (77).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 7 (96) and 5 (95).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 4 (97) and 2 (92).

Based on these valuations and considering a fair distribution, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 1).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 6).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 7).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (second highest for Agent 2 and no conflict).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value for item 4).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (Agent 3 values item 2 highly and itâ€™s available after item 4 is assigned).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (only remaining item).

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items, and all items are allocated according to the agents' valuations.
