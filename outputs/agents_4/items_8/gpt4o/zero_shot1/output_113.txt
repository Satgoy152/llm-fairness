Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  85  51  83  61  31  66  51
1  53  67  90  40   2  41  77  43
2  34  62  53  62  76  90  57  64
3  48  97   9  25  66  69  44  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. We can use a strategy that considers the value each agent assigns to an item, aiming to maximize the overall satisfaction. One simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest individual valuations. However, since we have constraints on integer allocations and must assign all items, we will attempt to balance the allocations across all agents.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives items that they value relatively highly compared to others.
2. Agent 1 gets items they value highly, considering the overall distribution.
3. Agent 2 receives items with high value to them, balancing the total number of items.
4. Agent 3 is allocated based on similar considerations.

After considering the valuation matrix and balancing the allocation, here is one possible solution:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 7]

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```
