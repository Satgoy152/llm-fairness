Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  35  92   9  29  61  13  29
1  53  87   0  32  47  99   4  31
2   8  85  82  18  24  78  61  45
3  77  41  93  14  11  73  37  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while taking into account their preferences, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their valuation as much as possible. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent Preferences:**
   - Agent 0: Prefers items with high values like 2 (92), 0 (52), and 5 (61).
   - Agent 1: Prefers items like 5 (99), 1 (87), and 0 (53).
   - Agent 2: Prefers items like 5 (78), 1 (85), and 2 (82).
   - Agent 3: Prefers items like 2 (93), 0 (77), and 5 (73).

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate the highest valued item to the agent who values it most.
   - Ensure each agent gets a fair distribution of items based on their preferences.

3. **Allocations:**
   - Agent 3 gets item 2 (93).
   - Agent 1 gets item 5 (99).
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (52).
   - Agent 2 gets item 1 (85).
   - Agent 0 gets item 6 (13) as a leftover, considering balanced allocation.
   - Agent 1 gets item 3 (32).
   - Agent 2 gets item 7 (45).
   - Agent 3 gets item 4 (11).

With the above considerations, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while keeping the distribution fair.
