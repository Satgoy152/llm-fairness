Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  78  54  54  23  48  61  95
1  14  55  41  26  46  68  88  38
2  60  52  58  25  97  46  27  96
3  75   1  24  24  86  29   3  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations of each agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.
2. Check that each agent gets a reasonable amount of items and adjust as necessary to ensure a fair distribution.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 75.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 78.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 54.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 54. However, since agent 0 already has three items, let's consider the next highest valuation.
5. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 26, Agent 2 at 25, and Agent 3 at 24. Assign to Agent 1.
6. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
7. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 68, and Agent 2 values it at 46. Assign to Agent 1.
8. Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 88, and Agent 2 values it at 27. Assign to Agent 1.
9. Item 7: Agent 2 values it at 96.

Now let's compile the assignments:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1 gets items: 3, 5, 6
- Agent 2 gets items: 4, 7
- Agent 3 gets no items

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": []
}
```
