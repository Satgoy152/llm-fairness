Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  90  11  13  99   0  55  57
1  40  21  39  59  69  58  67  34
2  26  94  17   1  38  76  49   2
3  10  54  64  98  66  28  91  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring every agent has at least one item, if possible. In this context, fairness can also be interpreted in terms of each agent having a comparable total valuation.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Items: 0, 1 (Total value: 177)

2. Agent 1:
   - Items: 3, 4 (Total value: 128)

3. Agent 2:
   - Items: 5, 6 (Total value: 125)

4. Agent 3:
   - Items: 2, 7 (Total value: 66 + 64 = 130)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations as much as possible. Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents, and each agent receives a fair share based on their value assessments.
