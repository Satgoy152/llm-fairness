Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  16  31  50  38  68  10  95
1  91  39   7  54  74  76  43  21
2  34   1  10  75  45  68  86  77
3  57  79  97  44  76  19   9  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to balance the distribution of total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would receive if they got each item.
2. Try to distribute the items so that each agent has a similar total valuation.

Let's attempt an allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 seems to value item 7 the highest (95).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (91).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (86).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (97).

Allocate these high-value items first to the respective agents:

- Agent 0 gets item 7.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 2.

Now, allocate the remaining items in a way that tries to balance the total valuations:

- Remaining items: 1, 3, 4, 5.

- Agent 3 also values item 1 (79) highly, so give agent 3 item 1.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the next highest (76), so give agent 1 item 5.
- Agent 0 values item 4 the next highest (38), so give agent 0 item 4.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the next highest (75), so give agent 2 item 3.

Now, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items (2 items each), and it attempts to balance the total valuation among the agents.
