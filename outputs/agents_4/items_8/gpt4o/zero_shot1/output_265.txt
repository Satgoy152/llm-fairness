Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  27   6  97   2  94  76  25
1  31  68  85  32  14  98  79  30
2  39  18  64  85  66  39  80  46
3  85  55  86  92  38  62  83  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's evaluate the optimal allocation by considering the preferences (values) of each agent for the items:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (97), Item 5 (94)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (98), Item 2 (85)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (80), Item 3 (85)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (92), Item 2 (86)

Given these preferences, we can allocate items to balance the total value received by each agent:

- Assign Item 3 and Item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 and Item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 6 and Item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 0 and Item 7 to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent gets items that are relatively more valuable to them while satisfying the condition of giving each agent 2 items.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```
