Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70   3  54  35  84  38  44  43
1  96  64  22  12  68  94  96  25
2  65  43  29  98  39  23  96  64
3  35   9  19  17  72  36  71  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. 

First, let's summarize each agent's preferences for the items:

- **Agent 0** values items highly: 0 (70), 4 (84)
- **Agent 1** values items highly: 0 (96), 6 (96)
- **Agent 2** values items highly: 3 (98), 6 (96)
- **Agent 3** values items highly: 4 (72), 6 (71)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (96) and item 6 (96). These are the highest values for these items among all agents. Assign items 0 and 6 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (98), which is the highest preference for this item. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (84), which is the highest preference for this item. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 3** has a high value for item 5 (36) among the remaining items. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 0** also values item 2 (54), which has not been allocated yet. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 2** values item 7 (64) highly among the remaining items. Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 3** is left with item 1 (9), which has not been allocated yet. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences to the extent possible. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
