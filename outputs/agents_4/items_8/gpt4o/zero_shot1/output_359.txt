Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  14  44  98  27  66  15  66
1  50  27  52  55  91  37  26  45
2  33  24  89  37   4  20   6  36
3  95  97  17  78  78  43  91   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can try to maximize the total value for each agent by assigning items based on their highest preferences. However, we also need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's look at the item valuations for each agent:

Agent 0: [99, 14, 44, 98, 27, 66, 15, 66]
Agent 1: [50, 27, 52, 55, 91, 37, 26, 45]
Agent 2: [33, 24, 89, 37,  4, 20,  6, 36]
Agent 3: [95, 97, 17, 78, 78, 43, 91,  2]

Let's try to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that the number of items allocated is fair.

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Continue allocating the next highest valued items to the remaining agents until all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation that attempts to achieve this:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 3] (99 + 98 = 197)
- Agent 1 gets items: [4, 2] (91 + 52 = 143)
- Agent 2 gets items: [1, 7] (24 + 36 = 60)
- Agent 3 gets items: [5, 6] (43 + 91 = 134)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
