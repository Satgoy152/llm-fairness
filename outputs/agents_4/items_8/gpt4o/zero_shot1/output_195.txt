Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  66  69  40  67  18   1   2
1  94  37  78  14  32  51  42  86
2  45  18  27  79  62  19  26  92
3  35  26  91  65  50  16  81  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. A common approach is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One possible way to allocate the items is by using a strategy like maximizing the sum of valuations or ensuring each agent gets a relatively fair share based on their preferences. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate items with high valuations: Item 0 (88), Item 1 (66)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate items with high valuations: Item 7 (86), Item 2 (78)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate items with high valuations: Item 3 (79), Item 7 (92) - Note: Item 7 is already allocated to Agent 1, so we should move to next best based on the remaining items.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocate items with high valuations: Item 6 (81), Item 2 (91) - Note: Item 2 is already allocated to Agent 1, so we should move to next best based on the remaining items.

Let's reconsider the allocations to ensure no item is doubly allocated and all items are assigned.

**Revised Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0 (88), Item 4 (67)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 (78), Item 7 (86)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 3 (79), Item 5 (19)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 1 (26), Item 6 (81)

This ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and all items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
