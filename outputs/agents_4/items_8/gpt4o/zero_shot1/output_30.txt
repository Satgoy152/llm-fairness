Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  22  39  40  61  65  95  69
1  99  25  37  95   8  43  49  35
2  19  82  41  31  90  15  61  76
3  24  23  99   5  11  53  87  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations and try to optimize the allocation such that each agent gets items that maximize their valuations. 

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations are for items 0, 6, and 5. Allocate items 0 and 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations are for items 0, 3, and 2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations are for items 4 and 7. Allocate items 4 and 7 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuations are for items 2 and 6. Allocate items 2 and 5 to Agent 3.

Ensuring that each agent gets some items and no item is allocated twice, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 6, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 3, which has a high valuation.
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 7, which they value highly.
- Agent 3 receives items 1, 2, and 5, which are reasonable given their high valuation for item 2.

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed fairly among the 4 agents.
