Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  79  75  66  14   5  58  28
1  84  20  40  52  94  80  79  59
2   3  50  90  27  39  97  38  49
3  10  66  13  12  56  71  80   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach to ensure fairness is to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items allocated to them while also ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Start by identifying which items each agent values the most.

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Total Value**: Allocate items to agents such that the total sum of values is maximized while ensuring a balanced distribution of items.

3. **Ensure Each Agent Gets an Integer Number of Items**: Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items to maintain balance.

Here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 2 (Values: 79 and 75)
- **Agent 1**: Items 4 and 5 (Values: 94 and 80)
- **Agent 2**: Items 5 and 6 (Values: 97 and 38)
- **Agent 3**: Items 0 and 7 (Values: 10 and 4)

However, this allocation would not be balanced, as some agents may end up with more items than others. We need a fair distribution, ideally with each agent receiving 2 items. Let's try again:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 2 (Values: 79 and 75)
- **Agent 1**: Items 4 and 7 (Values: 94 and 59)
- **Agent 2**: Items 5 and 6 (Values: 97 and 38)
- **Agent 3**: Items 0 and 3 (Values: 10 and 12)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the distribution of high-value items is balanced across the agents.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
