Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  12  42  75  51   0  63  71
1  45  87  75  62  98  18  27   0
2  62  77  96  75  64  93  34  83
3  10  72  22  98  19  98  77  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent gets. A possible approach is to assign items to the agents such that each gets approximately equal value, if possible, while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items allocated: [0, 7]
   - Total valuation: 67 + 71 = 138

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items allocated: [4, 6]
   - Total valuation: 98 + 27 = 125

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items allocated: [1, 5]
   - Total valuation: 77 + 93 = 170

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items allocated: [2, 3]
   - Total valuation: 22 + 98 = 120

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations each agent receives.

The JSON representation of this allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
