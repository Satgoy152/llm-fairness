Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  54  76   7  98  21  12  82
1  72  29  76  39  21   4  31  89
2  79  60  79  65  46  10  23  92
3  89  93   5   0  39  75  24  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[17 54 76  7 98 21 12 82]
 [72 29 76 39 21  4 31 89]

 [89 93  5  0 39 75 24 95]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Look for the highest valuation for each agent and prioritize giving that item to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Try to Balance Allocations:** Ensure each agent gets at least one item. Balance the distribution so no single agent gets a disproportionate number of high-valued items if it can be avoided.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 (98), item 2 (76)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 7 (89)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (65), item 0 (79)
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 1 (93), item 5 (75), item 6 (24)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and prioritizes higher-valued items for each agent. The total number of items allocated is exactly 8, meeting the requirement.

Now, I will present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
