Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  58  22  25   1  60  18  59
1  86  75  52  71  61  80  75  17
2   9  18  18   7  17  31  31  80
3  42  26  89  56  99  92  89  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation. This approach involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and the total number of items allocated equals 8.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 87.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 58.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the most at 89.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 71.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most at 99.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most at 92.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most at 89.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most at 80.

After this allocation, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, and adjust to ensure only 8 items are allocated. Let's adjust the allocation to be fair and make sure each agent gets at least one item.

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4, 5, 6

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.
