Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  70  47  89   9  99  73  23
1  18  49  25  43  66  54  17  27
2   8  76   0  76  35   2  11  79
3  82   6  99   4  86   8   9  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to consider the highest value each agent assigns to an item and try to allocate based on these values. Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Highest Values:**
   - Item 5: Value 99
   - Item 3: Value 89

2. **Agent 1's Highest Values:**
   - Item 4: Value 66
   - Item 1: Value 49

3. **Agent 2's Highest Values:**
   - Item 7: Value 79
   - Item 1: Value 76

4. **Agent 3's Highest Values:**
   - Item 2: Value 99
   - Item 0: Value 82

Let's allocate items based on the highest values for each agent:

- **Agent 0:** Item 5, Item 3
- **Agent 1:** Item 4, Item 1
- **Agent 2:** Item 7, Item 6
- **Agent 3:** Item 2, Item 0

This allocation ensures all items are assigned and each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations. Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [2, 0]
}
```
