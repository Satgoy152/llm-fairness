Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12   4  62  30  24  40  81   1
1  76  52  24  81  40  97  80  43
2  80  88  93  50  32  46  59  73
3   1  33   6  33  33  63  27  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a method based on maximizing the total utility, where we try to assign items to agents in such a way that the overall satisfaction is maximized.

Let's analyze the given valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items highly like item 2 (62), item 6 (81).
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 0 (76), 3 (81), 5 (97).
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 2 (93), 1 (88).
4. **Agent 3**: Has moderate valuations, with item 5 (63) being the highest.

Let's try to assign items based on maximizing each agent's total value:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 2 and 6 (values: 62, 81)
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 5 and 3 (values: 97, 81)
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 1 and 0 (values: 88, 80)
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 4 and 7 (values: 33, 48)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and we maximize the total value based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
