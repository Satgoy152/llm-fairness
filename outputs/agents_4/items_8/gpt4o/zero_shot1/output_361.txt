Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  21  99  65  89  78  34  22
1  65  30  59  49  12  55   3  12
2  42  76  58  15  95  89  78  75
3  25   6  32   7  11  80  11  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method called "round-robin" or "sequential allocation," which ensures that each agent has an opportunity to choose items based on their preferences. We'll consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to allocate items such that the sum of the values received by each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (99), 4 (89)
   - Allocate items: 2, 4

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 0 (65), 5 (55)
   - Allocate items: 0, 5

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 4 (95), 5 (89)
   - Since item 4 is taken, consider next highest available items: 6 (78), 7 (75)
   - Allocate items: 6, 7

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 7 (91), 5 (80)
   - Since items 5 and 7 are taken, consider next highest available items: 3 (7), 6 (11)
   - Allocate items: 3

Now let's check the allocations and ensure that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: 2, 4
- Agent 1: 0, 5
- Agent 2: 6, 7
- Agent 3: 3

Total items allocated: 8

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3]
}
```
