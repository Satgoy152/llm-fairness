Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  35  14  25  21  98  94  15
1  42  90  81  71  24  76  93  99
2  14  50  96  60   0  79  19  42
3  57  52  80  61   6  33  44  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's go through the process step by step.

1. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation**: We will first assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring no agent receives more items than others unless necessary due to the limit of 8 items.

2. **Ensure Fair Distribution**: We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item before allocating more to others.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is Agent 0 with 98.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is Agent 1 with 90.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is Agent 2 with 96.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is Agent 1 with 71.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is Agent 0 with 21.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is Agent 0 with 98.
- **Item 6**: Highest value is Agent 1 with 93.
- **Item 7**: Highest value is Agent 1 with 99.

Now, let's ensure each agent has at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4, 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 3, 6, 7
- **Agent 2**: Item 2
- **Agent 3**: No items

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned and that the agents receive items based on their highest valuations, while also trying to ensure a fair distribution.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": []
}
```
