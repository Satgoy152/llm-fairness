Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  32  61  88  84  60   0  69
1   2   4  11   3  57  29  90  69
2  75  56  52  72  54  17  11  10
3  67   8  63  85  78  64  61  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We'll attempt to balance allocations so that each agent gets a fair share based on the given valuations.

Here is a possible allocation plan:

- Agent 0: We'll allocate items that maximize their total valuation based on their preferences.
- Agent 1: Similarly, we'll select items that maximize their overall valuation considering the remaining items.
- Agent 2: We'll continue this process for agent 2.
- Agent 3: Finally, agent 3 will receive the remaining items.

Looking at the valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (61), so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (90), so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (75), so we allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (85), so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.

Now we continue allocating the remaining items:

5. Agent 0's next highest value is item 3, but it’s taken, so we look at item 7 (69), allocate item 7 to agent 0.
6. Agent 1's next highest available item is item 4 (57), so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.
7. Agent 2's next highest available item is item 1 (56), so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
8. Agent 3’s next highest available item is item 5 (64), so we allocate item 5 to agent 3.

Let's summarize these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their preferences as closely as possible, given the constraints.
