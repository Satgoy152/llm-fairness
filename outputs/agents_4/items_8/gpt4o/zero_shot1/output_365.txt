Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  60  16  92  40  95  19  92
1  14  79  71  40   5  65   6  69
2  55  15  84   5   6  25  11  42
3  83  38  12  67  12  77  12  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Distribute items to agents to maximize their total assigned value, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's calculate the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0: 27 + 60 + 16 + 92 + 40 + 95 + 19 + 92 = 441
- Agent 1: 14 + 79 + 71 + 40 + 5 + 65 + 6 + 69 = 349
- Agent 2: 55 + 15 + 84 + 5 + 6 + 25 + 11 + 42 = 243
- Agent 3: 83 + 38 + 12 + 67 + 12 + 77 + 12 + 69 = 370

Now, we allocate items to maximize the value for each agent:

1. Assign items that provide high value to an agent to that agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Let's assign the items:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 3, 5, and 7.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 has a relatively high value for item 2.
- Agent 3 has high values for items 0, 5, and 3.

Considering these values and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [3, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 7]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [0, 4, 6]

This ensures a fair distribution of items while trying to maximize the value each agent receives.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
