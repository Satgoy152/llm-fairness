Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  55  51  80  59  40  22  96
1  84  50  88  36  32  73  62  56
2  86  25  34   2  71  58   6  78
3   6  38  13  54  71  99  29  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. List all items and their valuations by each agent.
2. For each item, assign it to the agent who has the highest valuation for that item.
3. Ensure that the allocation results in each agent having an integer number of items.

Below is the allocation based on the valuations provided:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (value 86)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 55)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (value 88)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (value 80)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (value 71)
- Item 5: Agent 3 (value 99)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (value 62)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (value 96)

Based on this, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
