Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  54  45  76   5  96  10  66
1  60  37  57  22  93   2  65  85
2  64  28  44  94  56  93  51  31
3  49  55  83  69  62  20   6  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a roughly equal share of the total value, based on their individual valuations. The goal is to maximize the perceived value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 5: Value 96
   - Item 3: Value 76

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 4: Value 93
   - Item 7: Value 85

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 6: Value 51
   - Item 2: Value 44

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 1: Value 55
   - Item 0: Value 49

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while keeping the distribution relatively balanced. Each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuation, and maximizes the value each agent perceives from their allocated items.
