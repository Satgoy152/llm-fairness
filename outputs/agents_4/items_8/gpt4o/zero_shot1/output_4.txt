Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  72  80  90  53  69   8  46
1  10  32  36  35  44  62  96  23
2  23  72  32  62  14  48  32  96
3  10  58  75  11   9  59  65  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [10 32 36 35 44 62 96 23]

 [10 58 75 11  9 59 65 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations to maximize total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally get 2 items.

Let's analyze the given table and perform the allocation:

### Step 1: Assign items based on the highest valuation
- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (90), so we assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most (96), so we assign item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most (96), so we assign item 7 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (75), so we assign item 2 to agent 3.

### Step 2: Assign the remaining items
Now, each agent has one item. We need to distribute the remaining 4 items.

- Agent 0's next highest valuation is for item 2, but it's already taken. The next highest available item is 1 (72), so we assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1's next highest available item is 5 (62), so we assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2's next highest available item is 0 (23), so we assign item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3's next highest available item is 4 (9), so we assign item 4 to agent 3.

### Final Allocations
The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [7, 0],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

This way, each agent receives 2 items, and all 8 items are allocated.
