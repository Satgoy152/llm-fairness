Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  74  13  42  83  56  32  79
1   2  61  67  14  97  18  87  73
2  11  88  54  69  33  73  98  53
3  45  12  78  36  12  21  24  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [35, 74, 13, 42, 83, 56, 32, 79]
   - Highest valuations: 83, 79, 74
   - Allocate items 4 and 7 to Agent 0. 

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [2, 61, 67, 14, 97, 18, 87, 73]
   - Highest valuations: 97, 87
   - Allocate items 4 and 6 to Agent 1. (Item 4 is already taken, so next highest is 6)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [11, 88, 54, 69, 33, 73, 98, 53]
   - Highest valuations: 98, 88
   - Allocate items 6 and 1 to Agent 2. (Item 6 is already taken, so next highest is 1)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [45, 12, 78, 36, 12, 21, 24, 57]
   - Highest valuations: 78, 57
   - Allocate items 2 and 7 to Agent 3. (Item 7 is already taken, so next highest is 2)

Now let's check the allocations to make sure all items are distributed and no item is allocated more than once:

- Agent 0: [4, 7]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [2]

We still need to allocate items 0, 3, and 5.

5. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (highest unallocated value is 45).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (highest unallocated value is 69).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (highest unallocated value is 56).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, and all items have been allocated.
