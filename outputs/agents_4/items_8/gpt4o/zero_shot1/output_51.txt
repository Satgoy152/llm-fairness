Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  38  65  49  76  34  50  17
1  73  41  17  32  72  26  45  81
2  76  33  95  55  18  54  99  25
3  13  49  42  11  29  57  43  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a distribution that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's how we can proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4. Let's allocate those to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 7 the most, followed by item 0. However, since item 0 is already allocated, we give item 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Remaining items are 1, 3, and 5. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5 among the left items. We allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 6 out of 8 items. To complete the allocation:
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they have a decent valuation for it.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as they have a higher valuation for it compared to others.

The proposed allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
