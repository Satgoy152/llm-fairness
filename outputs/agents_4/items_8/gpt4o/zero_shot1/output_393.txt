Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  25  30  40  79  57  27  91
1  97  75  31   7  53  32  51  25
2  50  40  91  67  90  92   1   6
3  18  87  43  79  10   2  25  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents based on their valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their preferences. We have 4 agents and 8 items, so each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest value for item 7 (91), followed by item 4 (79). Let's allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (97), followed by item 1 (75). We allocate these items to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (92), followed by item 4 (90). However, item 4 is already allocated. The next highest valued item for Agent 2 that's available is item 2 (91). Allocate items 5 and 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: For Agent 3, the highest remaining valued item is item 1 (87), but it's already allocated. The next highest available valued items are 3 (79) and 7 (56). Since item 7 is already allocated, we allocate item 3 and item 6 to Agent 3.

Let's summarize these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their valuations.
