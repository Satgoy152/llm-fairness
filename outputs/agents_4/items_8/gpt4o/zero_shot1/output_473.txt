Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  87   0  99  66  37   1  28
1  52  52  32  43  58  66  39  18
2  41  35  41  80  46  83  40   0
3   7  25  77  23  97  51  22   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent’s valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High preference for item 3 (99) and item 1 (87).
   - Allocate items 3 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High preference for item 5 (66).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High preference for item 5 (83) but it’s already taken. Next best is item 3 (80).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (next best available).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High preference for item 4 (97).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it among remaining items.
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 3, as they have a moderate interest in it, and it balances their allocation.
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 2, as they have a moderate valuation for it.

Now, all items have been allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' preferences with a fair distribution of items.
