Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  30  73  97   8  64  15  55
1  65  47  15  34  81  17  22  93
2  45   9  26  70  24  31  40  81
3  31  57  23  30  74  23  47  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations for the items. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value for item 3 with 97.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for item 4 with 81.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for item 7 with 81.
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value for item 1 with 57.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 3.

Now, with the highest values allocated, we look at the remaining items and agents:

- Remaining items: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Remaining agents: 0, 1, 2, 3 (since each needs at least one item)

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest value for item 2 with 73.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Next highest value for item 0 with 65.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Next highest value for item 6 with 40.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 2.

8. **Agent 3**:
   - Next highest value for item 5 with 23.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 3.

With this allocation strategy, all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair allocation based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```
