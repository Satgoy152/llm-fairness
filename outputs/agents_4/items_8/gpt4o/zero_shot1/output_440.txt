Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  94  36  38  83  46  55  84
1  49  90  66   4  32  20  78  44
2  35  69  28  41  74  73  60  63
3  86  44  32  31  45  84  60  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the perceived fairness. One approach is to assign items to agents in such a way that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is correct.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 7.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 4 and 5.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 2.

Based on these observations, here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 7.
- Agent 1 receives item 6.
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 5.
- Agent 3 receives items 0, 2, and 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value while distributing all 8 items fairly among the agents.

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
