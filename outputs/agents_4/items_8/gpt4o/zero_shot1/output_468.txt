Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  35  17  54  90  29  36  12
1  94  87  33  19  82  48  37  40
2  68  89  66  31  98  96   3  51
3  77  15  10  48  75  55  84  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring an equitable distribution of items. We will aim to give each agent two items (since 8 items divided by 4 agents is 2 items per agent) and ensure the distribution is fair in terms of value.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Start with Agent 0:
   - Items 4 and 0 have the highest values for Agent 0 (90 and 68).
   
2. Move to Agent 1:
   - Items 0 and 1 are taken, so allocate items 4 and 5, which have good values for Agent 1 (82 and 48).
   
3. For Agent 2:
   - Items 4 and 5 are taken, so allocate items 1 and 3, which have relatively high values for Agent 2 (89 and 31).
   
4. Finally, allocate items to Agent 3:
   - Items 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 are taken, so allocate items 6 and 7, which have the highest values for Agent 3 (84 and 90).

Based on this strategy, here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```
