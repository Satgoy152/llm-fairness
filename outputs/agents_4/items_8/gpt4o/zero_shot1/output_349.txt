Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  74  85  49  18  23  87  58
1  89  11  26  30  42  31  41   5
2  96  91  50  44  21  65  74  14
3  67  95  53  34  50  40  33  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim to distribute the items in a way that optimizes fairness. One way to achieve this is by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, given that there are 8 items and 4 agents.

Here's one potential fair allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign the items that Agent 0 values highly to them. Items 2 (85) and 6 (87) are highly valued by Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that Agent 1 values more than other agents, such as item 0 (89).
3. **Agent 2**: Items that Agent 2 values highly are items 1 (91) and 5 (65).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items that Agent 3 values highly, such as item 3 (34) and item 7 (36).

After distributing the items, check to ensure each agent receives a total of 2 items because there are 8 items and 4 agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, balancing the distribution based on their valuation of the items.
