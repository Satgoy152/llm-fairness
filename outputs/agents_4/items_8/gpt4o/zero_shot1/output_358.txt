Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85   6  97  33  98  67  84  58
1  71  33  11  18  94  49  35  62
2  72  52  91  95  49  27  22  35
3  43  76  19  40  12  10  41  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. This is a simplified example of a combinatorial auction problem where each agent values items differently.

Let's approach the problem by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most at 76.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 98.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 67.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most at 99.

Now, we need to adjust to ensure a fairer distribution of items among agents, since currently Agent 0 holds too many items.

Reallocate some items to ensure fairness:

- **Initial Allocation**:
  - Agent 0: [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]
  - Agent 1: []
  - Agent 2: [3]
  - Agent 3: [1, 7]

- Adjust to spread out items:
  - Move Item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value).
  - Move Item 5 to Agent 2 (next highest value).

- **Final Allocation**:
  - Agent 0: [0, 2, 6]
  - Agent 1: [4]
  - Agent 2: [3, 5]
  - Agent 3: [1, 7]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
