Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  70  57  42  38  37  35  73
1  32  51  42  83  20  82  38  14
2   1  77  22  97  38  20  40  84
3  21   9   1  62  63  26  85  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to ensure that the total value of items received by each agent is balanced, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

One potential approach is to use a greedy algorithm to maximize the sum of values for each agent. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they receive each item.
2. Assign items to agents with the highest individual item value for that agent, ensuring each item is only assigned once.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Best item: 7 (73)

- Agent 1 values:
  - Best item: 3 (83)

- Agent 2 values:
  - Best item: 3 (97) 

- Agent 3 values:
  - Best item: 7 (88)

To ensure a fair allocation, let's distribute items considering these priorities:

1. Agent 2 gets item 3 (97).
2. Agent 3 gets item 7 (88).
3. Agent 0 gets item 1 (70).
4. Agent 1 gets item 5 (82).
5. Agent 0 gets item 0 (44).
6. Agent 3 gets item 6 (85).
7. Agent 2 gets item 2 (22).
8. Agent 1 gets item 4 (20).

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes each agent's value as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [7, 6]
}
```
