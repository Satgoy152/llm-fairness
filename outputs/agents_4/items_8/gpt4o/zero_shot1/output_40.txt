Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  10  87   6  78  99   9  52
1  11  44   4  51  82  64  85  30
2  65  67   6  74  53  86  33  51
3  62  93   1  65  24  83  70  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a number of items in a way that maximizes their total valuation, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. There are 8 items and 4 agents, so ideally, each agent should get 2 items. Let's go through the process of allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations for Agent 0 are for items 5 (99) and 2 (87). Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations for Agent 1 are for items 6 (85) and 4 (82). Assign these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations for Agent 2 are for items 5 (86) and 1 (67). However, item 5 is already taken. Assign items 3 (74) and 0 (65) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuations for Agent 3 are for items 1 (93) and 5 (83). However, both items are already taken. Assign items 7 (58) and 6 (70) to Agent 3, as they are the next highest available.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their valuation, given the constraints.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on the highest possible valuations by each agent for the available items.
