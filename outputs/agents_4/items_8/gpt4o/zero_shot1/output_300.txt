Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  60  33  18  89  79  11  30
1   9   8  36   0  80  28  21  29
2  85   4  20  20   7  30  95  41
3  97  94  97  89  49  43  36  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items fairly:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Start by identifying the highest valuations for each item across all agents.
2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more items than fair distribution allows unless it improves overall fairness.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Item 0: Highest value is by agent 3 (97).
- Item 1: Highest value is by agent 3 (94).
- Item 2: Highest value is by agent 3 (97).
- Item 3: Highest value is by agent 3 (89).
- Item 4: Highest value is by agent 0 (89).
- Item 5: Highest value is by agent 0 (79).
- Item 6: Highest value is by agent 2 (95).
- Item 7: Highest value is by agent 3 (61).

Now, allocate items ensuring fairness and balance among agents:

- Agent 3 should receive items 0, 1, 2, and 3 because they have the highest valuations for these items.
- Agent 0 should receive items 4 and 5 because they have the highest value for these items after Agent 3.
- Agent 2 should receive item 6 because they value it the highest after Agent 3.
- Agent 1 should receive item 7 because it balances the allocation and values it reasonably after Agent 3.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuations while maintaining a balance in the distribution.
