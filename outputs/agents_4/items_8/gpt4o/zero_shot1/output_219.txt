Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  24  89   1  11   2  70  50
1  17  77  60  50  55  23  34  61
2  19  53  48  96  21  91  24  98
3  89  88  92  25  15  73  77  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 2 (89), 6 (70)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 1 (77), 7 (61)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 3 (96), 7 (98)
   
4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value items: 0 (89), 7 (97)

To ensure a fair allocation, let's proceed by considering the top choices for each agent and making sure each agent receives one item initially before further distribution:

1. Assign the highest value item to each agent:
   - Agent 0 receives item 2 (value 89)
   - Agent 1 receives item 1 (value 77)
   - Agent 2 receives item 7 (value 98)
   - Agent 3 receives item 0 (value 89)

2. Assign the remaining items considering the next highest value:
   - Remaining items: 3, 4, 5, 6
   
   - Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 70)
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 55)
   - Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 96)
   - Agent 3 gets item 5 (value 73)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of high-value items. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
