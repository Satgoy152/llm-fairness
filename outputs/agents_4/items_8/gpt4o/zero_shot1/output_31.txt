Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  75  60  65  55  28  18   7
1   4   0  83   9  60  99  11  50
2  34  51  36  38  30  93  33  74
3  28  75  40  86  71  20  98  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0** seems to value item 1 highly and has moderate valuations for items 2 and 3. The highest value is item 1, so we allocate that item to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5, and item 2 also has a high value. We allocate items 5 and 2 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest for agent 2 is item 7, so we allocate item 7 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for item 6 and item 3. We allocate both items to agent 3.

5. After these allocations, items 0, 4 remain unallocated. We can assign these based on the next highest valuations:
   - **Agent 2** has 34 for item 0, which is the highest remaining value for this item, so we allocate item 0 to agent 2.
   - **Agent 0** has 55 for item 4, which is the highest remaining value for this item, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.

Now let's present the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
