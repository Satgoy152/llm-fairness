Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  90  37  92  15  13  53  19
1  82  12  37  55  39  36  99  96
2   0  66  18  10   8  57  10   3
3  34  51  12  32  30  83   8  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, keeping fairness in mind.

Let's look at how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values for Agent 0 are for items 3 (92) and 1 (90). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 6 (99). Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 5 (57). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 5 (83), but since it's already allocated, the next highest is item 1 (51). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 4 items. We need to allocate the remaining 4 items.

5. **Remaining items**: Items 0, 2, 4, and 7 are yet to be allocated. Let's distribute them considering remaining high values:

   - Agent 0 has high values for item 0 (34), and item 2 (37). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has a reasonable value for item 7 (96). Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 3 has a reasonable value for item 0 (34). Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 2 has a value for item 4 (8), though low, it is reasonable for distribution. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

This gives us a fair distribution of the items based on the given valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and we have fairly distributed the items based on the agents' valuations.
