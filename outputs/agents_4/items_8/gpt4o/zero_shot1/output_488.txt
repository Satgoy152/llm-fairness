Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  91  41  70  73  24   8  12
1  36  75  80  45   1  31  58  63
2  41   0  36  72  57  46  67  28
3  45  21  62  15  94  90  28  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction or fairness.

Let's examine the valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 1, 3, and 4.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest, followed by item 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the highest, followed by item 3.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest, followed by item 5.

We can try to allocate the items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an item.

- Agent 0: Allocate items 1 and 3, as they are among the highest valued by Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Allocate items 2 and 0, as they are highly valued by Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Allocate item 6, as it is the highest valued by Agent 2.
- Agent 3: Allocate items 4, 5, and 7, as they are among the highest valued by Agent 3.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences and ensures all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 5, 7]
}
```
