Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  34   5  91  53  46  79  45
1  54  40  22  64  50  24  45  21
2   2  19  74   1  23  78  69  44
3   3  86  19  81   3  58  36  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Each agent should have an integer number of items, and in this case, we'll aim for each agent to receive 2 items since there are 4 agents and 8 items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for potential allocations and choose a fair distribution:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 0 (88)
   - Allocation: Items [3, 0]

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (64), Item 0 (54)
   - Allocation: Items [4, 1] (since 3 and 0 are already taken, we take the next highest)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (78), Item 2 (74)
   - Allocation: Items [5, 2]

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (86), Item 3 (81)
   - Allocation: Items [7, 6] (since 1 and 3 are already taken, we take the next highest)

Let's finalize the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [7, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with each agent getting two items.
