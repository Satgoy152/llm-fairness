Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  71  89  75  61  45  49  68
1  56   7  30   9  97  67   2  81
2  34   2  73  77  17  75  44  99
3  19  49  76  31  23  61  19  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents, taking into account their valuations for each item. One common approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also attempting to balance the overall distribution.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest value preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and that the total number of items allocated equals 8.

Here's a possible step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value 89)
   - Next highest value item: Item 1 (value 71)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value 97)
   - Next highest value item: Item 7 (value 81)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: Item 7 (value 99) - Already taken
   - Next highest value item: Item 3 (value 77)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item: Item 7 (value 86) - Already taken
   - Next highest value item: Item 2 (value 76) - Already taken
   - Next highest value item: Item 5 (value 61)

5. Allocate remaining items to agents who have received fewer items or have lower overall values.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [2, 1]
- Agent 1: [4, 7]
- Agent 2: [3, 6]
- Agent 3: [5, 0]

JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute items by considering each agent's preferences and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, totaling 8 items in all.
