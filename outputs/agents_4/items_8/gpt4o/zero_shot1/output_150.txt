Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  39  76   3  97  99  22  89
1  54  69  36   7  60   3  89  51
2  69  73  92  45  49   6  58  78
3  85  92  77  32  34  19  26  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[20 39 76  3 97 99 22 89]
 [54 69 36  7 60  3 89 51]
 [69 73 92 45 49  6 58 78]
 [85 92 77 32 34 19 26 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their valuations while distributing all 8 items. Let's consider the valuations table and try to allocate items in a way that balances the total valuation.

Here’s a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 and 5.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 7.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.

Using this approach, here’s how we can allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [6]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 1, 3]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fairly valued selection based on the given table, and all 8 items are distributed.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
