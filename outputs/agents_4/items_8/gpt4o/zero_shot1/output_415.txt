Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  95  44  93  65   0  57  94
1  81  11  23  91  73  25  81  42
2  18  48  73  67  29   7  72  88
3   8  78  85  13  35  18  13  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a strategy that aims to maximize total satisfaction or distribute high-value items to each agent. One approach is to allocate items in a way that ensures each agent receives items they value highly, while considering the constraints.

Let's start by attempting to allocate items based on the highest value each agent has for any item they can get, distributing them as evenly as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: 95 (Item 1)
   - Next high value: 94 (Item 7)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: 91 (Item 3)
   - Next high value: 81 (Item 0 or Item 6)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: 88 (Item 7)
   - Next high value: 73 (Item 2)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: 85 (Item 2)
   - Next high value: 78 (Item 1)

To distribute items fairly, we can assign the highest-valued items that have not yet been assigned to other agents:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 3

After these initial allocations, let's allocate remaining items based on the next highest values for each agent:

- For Agent 0, assign Item 0 (value 47)
- For Agent 1, assign Item 6 (value 81)
- For Agent 2, assign Item 5 (value 7)
- For Agent 3, assign Item 4 (value 35)

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```

These allocations ensure that each agent receives two items, and all 8 items are allocated.
