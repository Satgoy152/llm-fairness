Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54   8  49  21  94  97  40  86
1  18  49   4  55  31   3  20  87
2  38   7  87  19  80  64  65  86
3  38  85   9  52  28  63  23  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Given there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent can ideally receive 2 items. Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values for Agent 0 are item 5 (97) and item 4 (94).
2. **Agent 1**: After removing items 5 and 4, the highest values for Agent 1 are item 7 (87) and item 3 (55).
3. **Agent 2**: After removing items 5, 4, 7, and 3, the highest values for Agent 2 are item 2 (87) and item 6 (65).
4. **Agent 3**: The remaining items are 0 and 1. Agent 3 values item 1 the most (85) and item 0 (38).

Now, each agent has been allocated 2 items. Let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```
