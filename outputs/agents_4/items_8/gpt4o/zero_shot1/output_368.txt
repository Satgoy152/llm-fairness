Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  71  29  83  19  25  52   6
1  11  44  45  50  56  22  69  34
2  17  53  61  47  25  45   9  48
3  24  40  40  59  63  25  77  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s one way to proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate the total value for each agent if they get their highest-valued items:**
   - Agent 0: Highest values are 83, 71, 56
   - Agent 1: Highest values are 69, 56, 50
   - Agent 2: Highest values are 61, 53, 48
   - Agent 3: Highest values are 77, 63, 59

2. **Assign items to maximize each agent's value:**
   - Agent 0 should get items with values 83, 71, and 56 (items 3, 1, 0).
   - Agent 1 should get items with values 69 and 56 (items 6, 4).
   - Agent 2 should get items with values 61 and 53 (items 2, 7).
   - Agent 3 should get items with values 77 and 63 (items 5).

3. **Ensure all items are allocated:**
   - Agent 0: Items [3, 1, 0]
   - Agent 1: Items [6, 4]
   - Agent 2: Items [2, 7]
   - Agent 3: Item [5]

Now, representing this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 0],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their value based on the given table, while all 8 items are assigned.
