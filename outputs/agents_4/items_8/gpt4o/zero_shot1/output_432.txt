Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  82  72  48  21  85  40  21
1  24   4  85  11  50  84  61  42
2  38  33  33  17  73  10  29  99
3  58  44  25  28  53  51  34  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets the items they value the most while ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. **Calculate the Ideal Number of Items per Agent**: With 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should receive 2 items.

2. **Rank Items for Each Agent**: Rank the items for each agent based on their valuations, from highest to lowest.

3. **Allocate Items**:
    - For each agent, select the two items with the highest valuations that have not yet been assigned to another agent.
    - Ensure no item is allocated to more than one agent.

4. **Resolve Conflicts**: In case of a conflict where two agents have high valuation for the same item, choose the allocation that maximizes the overall satisfaction or reassign items to ensure each agent receives 2 items.

Following this process, we can perform the allocation as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Values the items 0, 1, and 5 highly. Allocate items 0 and 5.
- **Agent 1**: Values items 2 and 5, but item 5 is already allocated. Allocate items 2 and another available high-value item, say item 4.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 7 highly, and another available item, say item 4, but item 4 is already allocated. Allocate items 7 and another available high-value item, say item 3.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 0 highly, but it's already allocated. Allocate the remaining items 6 and 1.

Based on this allocation, the JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [6, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and all items are distributed without conflict.
