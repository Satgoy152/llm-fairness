Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  12  27  66  73  31   8  27
1  71  74  39  22  30  78   3  78
2  51  32  27   0  96  45  15  44
3  15  52  50  44  87  68  18   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to ensure that each agent gets items that they value highly while also ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning items based on the highest value for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest (71).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest (74).
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest (39).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest (66).
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the highest (96).
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the highest (78).
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the highest (8).
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it the highest (78).

2. Review and adjust to ensure a fair distribution. Aim to distribute items so that each agent gets at least one item if possible:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 3
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 0
   - Assign Item 7 to Agent 2

Now let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has been assigned a fair share of items, and all items have been allocated.
