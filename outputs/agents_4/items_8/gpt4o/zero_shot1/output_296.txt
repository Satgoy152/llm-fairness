Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  98  73  88  84  16  80  56
1  75  66  10   5  45  72  62  46
2  47  76  17  90  15  96   7  79
3   4  26  59  26  82  26  92  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's preferences are respected as much as possible while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (98), 3 (88), 4 (84), 6 (80)
   - Allocation: [1, 3] 

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (75), 5 (72)
   - Allocation: [0, 5]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 7 (79), 5 (96)
   - Allocation: [7]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (92), 4 (82)
   - Allocation: [4, 2, 6]

This allocation ensures that each item is distributed, and each agent receives a fair amount of high-valuation items according to their preferences.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4, 2, 6]
}
```
