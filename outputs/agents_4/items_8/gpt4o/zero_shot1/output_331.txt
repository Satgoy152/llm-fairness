Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  27  92   6  69  89   3  78
1  14  30   1  67  21   9  19  91
2  86  96  40  66   9   7   6  49
3  84  40  13  78  41  91  19  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to consider each agent's total value for their allocated items and try to distribute the items so that the total value is relatively balanced across the agents.

Here's a possible allocation of items to agents:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 88), as agent 0 values this item highly.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 96), as agent 2 values this item the most across all agents.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 92), as agent 0 values this item highly.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 78), as agent 3 values this item highly.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 69), as agent 0 values this item highly.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 91), as agent 3 values this item highly.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 1 (value 19), as agent 1 values this item the most across all agents.
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 (value 91), as agent 1 values this item the most across all agents.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```
