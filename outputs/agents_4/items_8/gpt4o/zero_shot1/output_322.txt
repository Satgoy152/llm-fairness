Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  57  28  67  23  64  94  24
1  41  59  46  66  36  73  96  74
2  83  97  40  19  22   1  83  12
3  72  58   5  47  20  27  66  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agentâ€™s total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item. Given there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should receive 2 items. 

To achieve this, we can use a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for the items.
2. Assign items in rounds:
   - First, assign one item to each agent based on the highest available valuation they have among the unallocated items.
   - Then, assign a second item to each agent based on the next highest available valuation they have.

Let's do this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Assign the first item to each agent

- **Agent 0:** Highest valuation is for item 6 (value 94).
- **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 6 (value 96), but item 6 is taken, so next highest is item 5 (value 73).
- **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 97).
- **Agent 3:** Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 72).

### Step 2: Assign the second item to each agent

- **Agent 0:** Next highest valuation is for item 3 (value 67).
- **Agent 1:** Next highest valuation is for item 7 (value 74).
- **Agent 2:** Next highest valuation is for item 0 (value 83), but item 0 is taken, so next is item 6 (value 83), but item 6 is taken, so next is item 2 (value 40).
- **Agent 3:** Next highest valuation is for item 3 (value 47), but item 3 is taken, so next is item 1 (value 58), but item 1 is taken, so next is item 5 (value 27), but item 5 is taken, so next is item 4 (value 20).

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives two items, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
