Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  95   9  78  88  86  85  41
1  67  15  23  24   8  27  90  87
2  43  58  12  12  15  86  54  67
3  90  92  86  79  72  24   9  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 95  9 78 88 86 85 41]
 [67 15 23 24  8 27 90 87]
 [43 58 12 12 15 86 54 67]
 [90 92 86 79 72 24  9 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents based on their valuations, one approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Item 1: Value 95
   - Item 3: Value 78

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Item 6: Value 90
   - Item 7: Value 87

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Item 5: Value 86

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Item 0: Value 90
   - Item 2: Value 86
   - Item 4: Value 72

This allocation ensures a fair distribution of items by maximizing each agent's total valuation. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
