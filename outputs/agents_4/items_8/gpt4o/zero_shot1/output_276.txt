Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90   8  96  28  36   8  41  76
1  53  82  59  15  28  78  88  85
2  41  13  42  22  86  39  22  49
3  72  22  25  32   3  50  69  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 82 59 15 28 78 88 85]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations and try to distribute items such that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their preferences. Here's a potential allocation strategy using a combination of maximizing individual agent satisfaction and ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest (90).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, who values it the highest (82).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0, who values it the highest (96).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3, who values it the highest (32).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2, who values it the highest (86).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1, who has the second-highest valuation (78).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 1, who has the highest valuation (88).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 3, who values it the highest (93).

This allocation attempts to cover a balance between the highest valuations for any given item and a fair distribution of items among agents.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
