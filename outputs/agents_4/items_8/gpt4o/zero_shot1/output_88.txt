Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  35  78  59  86  43  93  25
1  91  35  89   6  10  30  30  38
2  88  78   6  89  86  79  82  18
3  52  93  35  51  57  15  39  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed.

One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 93.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 78.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 89.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 79.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most at 68.

Now, let's distribute the items equally among the agents by adjusting some allocations:

1. Start by giving each agent at least one item they value highly.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure fairness in the number of items each agent receives.

After these considerations, here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

Each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
