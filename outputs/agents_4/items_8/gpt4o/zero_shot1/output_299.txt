Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  62  41  24   6  98  45  34
1  44  41   4   7  49  18  40  88
2  29  64  12  23  69  12  21  76
3  83   8  81  53  60  42  28  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate the items that agent 0 values highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that agent 1 values highly but are not already taken by agent 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that agent 2 values highly but are not already taken by agents 0 and 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that agent 3 values highly but are not already taken by agents 0, 1, and 2.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (93), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- **Agent 3** values item 2 the highest (81) and item 0 is already taken, so allocate item 2 to agent 3.
- **Agent 0** values item 5 the second-highest (98), so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 7 the highest (88), so allocate item 7 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (69), so allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 3 next (53), so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- **Agent 0** values item 1 next (62), so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 6 next (40), so allocate item 6 to agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 1],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their preferences, maximizing the value they derive from the allocated items.
