Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  32   4  38  78  74  43  59
1  44  61  49  73  45   1  89  51
2  12  60  10  22  54  51  27  26
3  39  98  65  17  26  11  70   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Additionally, we'll try to distribute the items in a balanced way so that each agent receives a fair share.

Given the valuation table, we can attempt to allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0:** This agent highly values items 4 and 5, with values of 78 and 74, respectively. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** This agent highly values items 3 and 6, with values of 73 and 89, respectively. Assign these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** This agent values item 1 relatively highly at 60. Assign this item to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** This agent highly values item 1 at 98, but since it's already taken, we can assign item 2 to Agent 3, which has a value of 65.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 7):

- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 3, who values it at 39, which is higher than any other agent's valuation for this item.
- **Item 7**: Assign to Agent 2, who values it at 26, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item among the unassigned items.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items while maximizing the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.
