Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  65   1  47  64  48  20  36
1  96  96  86  46  74  99  69  61
2  29  22  50  52  12  92  38  18
3  45  21  73  76  13  74  97  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider both the agents' valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 8 items being allocated. One approach to achieve this is to use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation while distributing items as evenly as possible among the agents.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Assign the Highest Valuation Items First**: Start by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. This ensures that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is maximized.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets an Item (if possible)**: Try to distribute items such that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while ensuring all items are allocated.

3. **Balance the Number of Items**: Make sure the number of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's apply this process to the given data:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 96 by Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 96 by Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 86 by Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 76 by Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 74 by Agent 1.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 99 by Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 97 by Agent 3.
- **Item 7**: Highest value is 61 by Agent 1.

By the above steps, Agent 1 is initially assigned most items due to their high valuations. However, to ensure a fair distribution, we balance the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 3.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 2, 4, and 5.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 7.
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 1 and 6.

This distribution ensures that each agent has an integer number of items and uses all 8 items.

Here are the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```
