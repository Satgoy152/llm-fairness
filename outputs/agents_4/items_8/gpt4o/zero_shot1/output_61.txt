Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  47   8   0  58  41   1  70
1  99  44   0  18  39  98   1  34
2  89   6  85  83  62  30  14  75
3  83  98  24  66  17  12  42   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an approximately equal total valuation, while ensuring that all 8 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 4, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has a particularly high valuation for item 0.
3. **Agent 2** values items 2 and 3 the most.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 highly.

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because they value it the most.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 due to their high valuation.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 for their high valuation.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 as they also have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 for their high valuation.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3, as it balances their total value.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0, as they value it highly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, considering their preferences for specific items.
