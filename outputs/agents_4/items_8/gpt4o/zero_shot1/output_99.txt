Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16   7  86  79   3  66  67  92
1  48  25  32  36  36  50  67  32
2  63  47  15   4  19  17  32  49
3   9  21  39  38  44  11   7  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. We'll attempt to maximize the total utility for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s one approach to achieving a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has relatively balanced valuations, with item 0 being notably high.
3. **Agent 2** has a strong preference for item 0, but it's already a good choice for Agent 1.
4. **Agent 3** doesn't have any standout high valuations, so we may prioritize items with moderate values.

Now, let's assign the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 2 and 7, which have high values (86 and 92).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 0 and 5, which have decent values (48 and 50).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 6 and 4, which have reasonable values (32 and 19).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 1 and 3, which have moderate values (21 and 38).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and considers their highest valuations as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
