Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  40  69  26  66  36  44  38
1  35  19   0  33  14  58   2  13
2   5  51  20  86  90  44  20  88
3  62  72  54  89  12  27  83  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly. We will also aim to distribute the items as evenly as possible to ensure each agent gets a fair share.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations and distributing the items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. **Agent 0**: They highly value items 2 (69) and 4 (66).
2. **Agent 1**: They highly value items 5 (58) and 0 (35).
3. **Agent 2**: They highly value items 4 (90) and 3 (86).
4. **Agent 3**: They highly value items 3 (89) and 6 (83).

We will distribute the items based on the above preferences, balancing the number of items each agent receives:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (second-highest value).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (highest value).
  
Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (since they highly value it).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (since they value it highly).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (since it's their next highest value).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (since it's their next highest value).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, with consideration given to their valuations.

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
