Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  48  47  97  12  77  52  56
1  95  29  40  62  96  68  74  70
2  91  66  76  38  45  73  97  74
3   7  28  80   1  89  53  39  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value of items assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated. This is a simplified example and may not result in the absolute optimal allocation, but it will attempt to balance fairness and value.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highly for: 3 (97), 5 (77), 6 (52)
- Agent 1 values items highly for: 0 (95), 4 (96), 6 (74)
- Agent 2 values items highly for: 0 (91), 6 (97), 7 (74)
- Agent 3 values items highly for: 2 (80), 4 (89)

A possible allocation strategy is to assign the highest-valued items for each agent while avoiding conflicts:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (97).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (95).
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (97).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (89).

Now we have 4 more items to allocate: 1, 2, 5, 7.

- Agent 0: Assign item 5 (77).
- Agent 1: Assign item 2 (40).
- Agent 2: Assign item 7 (74).
- Agent 3: Assign item 1 (28).

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, with all items being allocated.
