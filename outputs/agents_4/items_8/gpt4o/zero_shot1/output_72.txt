Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4   3  81  23  70  10  37  98
1  95  51  90  63  38   8  30  70
2  84  17  48  76  85  34  20  51
3   2  22  19  64  63  63  32  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can adopt a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We can follow these steps to achieve a reasonable allocation:

1. Calculate the highest value that each agent has for any item.
2. Assign that item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Continue this process while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.
4. After the initial allocation, if there are any remaining items, assign them to agents who have the least total value but have fewer items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (98), so item 7 is allocated to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (95), so item 0 is allocated to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (85), so item 4 is allocated to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 7 second most (77), but since item 7 is already allocated, we assign item 3 to agent 3 (64).

Now each agent has one item. Let's allocate the remaining items: 1, 2, 5, 6.

- Assign item 2 to agent 1, who values it at 90.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2, who values it the next highest at 34.
- Assign item 6 to agent 0, who values it the next highest at 37.
- Assign item 1 to agent 3, who values it the next highest at 22.

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
``` 

In this allocation, each agent receives two items, and the total number of allocated items is 8, satisfying the requirement.
