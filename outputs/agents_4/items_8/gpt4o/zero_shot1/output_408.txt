Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  25  88  18  90   3  65  87
1   1  54  18  73  92  97  22  78
2  95  54   7  11  97  55  75  64
3  82  25  36   4  77  47  58  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 54 18 73 92 97 22 78]

 [82 25 36  4 77 47 58 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 8 items allocated. The goal is to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction or valuation is maximized.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [39, 25, 88, 18, 90, 3, 65, 87]
- Agent 1: [1, 54, 18, 73, 92, 97, 22, 78]
- Agent 2: [95, 54, 7, 11, 97, 55, 75, 64]
- Agent 3: [82, 25, 36, 4, 77, 47, 58, 34]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it has a high value for them (90).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them (97).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for them (95).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it has a relatively higher value compared to other agents (4).

Now, we have allocated 4 items. Next, we need to allocate the remaining 4 items:

5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it has a high value for them (88).
6. Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as it has a high value for them (78).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it has a high value for them (75).
8. Assign item 1 to Agent 3, as it has a higher value compared to other remaining items (25).

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```
