Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  88  82  34  82  93  78  47
1   3  41  22  18  32  72  22  92
2  15  30  20   9  87  11  74  29
3  41  49  60  49  47  45  35  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations. One approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: 38, 88, 82, 34, 82, 93, 78, 47
   - High valuations: Item 5 (93), Item 1 (88), Item 2 (82)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: 3, 41, 22, 18, 32, 72, 22, 92
   - High valuations: Item 7 (92), Item 5 (72)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: 15, 30, 20, 9, 87, 11, 74, 29
   - High valuations: Item 4 (87), Item 6 (74)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: 41, 49, 60, 49, 47, 45, 35, 18
   - High valuations: Item 2 (60), Item 1 (49), Item 3 (49)

Let's allocate the items based on these high valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 5 (93) and 1 (88)
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 7 (92)
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 4 (87) and 6 (74)
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 2 (60) and 3 (49)

Now, we have allocated 7 items (5, 1, 7, 4, 6, 2, 3). We still need to allocate one more item to make it a total of 8 items. The remaining item is 0.

- **Agent 0** can take item 0, as it has the highest valuation for it (38).

Now we have the complete allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.
