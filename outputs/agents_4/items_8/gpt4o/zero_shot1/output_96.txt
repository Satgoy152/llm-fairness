Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  39  88  44  36  34  66  37
1  13  36  40  14  45  84  73  93
2   0  48  77   4  89  77  64  91
3  74  51  87  69  45  45  27  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 36 40 14 45 84 73 93]

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. Here is one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuation for item 2 (88) and item 0 (62).
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuation for item 7 (93) and item 5 (84).
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuation for item 4 (89) and item 7 (91), but item 7 is allocated to agent 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuation for item 0 (74) and item 3 (69), but item 0 is allocated to agent 0.

Given these observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it the most.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as they value it the most.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as they value it highly and it balances the allocation.

Now, we have 4 remaining items to allocate:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they have the highest remaining valuation for it.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as they have the highest remaining valuation for it.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as they value it highly.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3, as it helps balance the allocation.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least two items and maximizes their preferences where possible.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```
