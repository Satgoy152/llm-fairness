Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  28  59  41  59  57  80  81
1   1  48  25  17  80  65  25  63
2   8  69  89   4   6  27  40  93
3  31  92  39  55  86  38   7  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given that there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items to make the distribution fair in terms of count. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 0 with a valuation of 81.
   - Item 6 has the next highest valuation for Agent 0 with a value of 80.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 1 with a valuation of 80.
   - Item 1 has the next highest valuation for Agent 1 with a value of 48.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 2 with a valuation of 93. However, it is already allocated to Agent 0, so we choose the next highest.
   - Item 2 has the highest available value for Agent 2 with a valuation of 89.
   - Item 1 has the next highest available value for Agent 2 with a value of 69, but it is already allocated to Agent 1. So, we choose Item 5 with a valuation of 27.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 3 with a valuation of 92, but it is already allocated to Agent 1, so we choose the next highest.
   - Item 4 has the highest available value for Agent 3 with a valuation of 86, but it is already allocated to Agent 1, so we choose Item 3 with a valuation of 55.
   - Item 0 has the next highest available value for Agent 3 with a valuation of 31.

After making these decisions, we ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives exactly 2 items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
