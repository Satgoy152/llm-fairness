Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  91  24  79  10  96  17  11
1  12  85  51  94  42  29  35  74
2  33  16  97  63  35  16  95  47
3  81  77  66  40  13  64  51  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach is to maximize the total valuation across all agents or ensure some balance of valuations per agent. Below is one possible allocation strategy, considering both the fairness and the valuations:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest value preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's one way to do it:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6
- Agent 3: Items 0, 4

This allocation ensures that:

- Agent 0 receives items with values 91 and 96.
- Agent 1 receives items with values 94 and 74.
- Agent 2 receives items with values 97 and 95.
- Agent 3 receives items with values 81 and 13.

The items are allocated in a way that considers each agent's preferences and tries to maximize the total value received by each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the condition that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
