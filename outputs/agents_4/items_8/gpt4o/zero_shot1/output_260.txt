Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  30  80  76  24  82  95   3
1  85  74  26  30  95  42  41   5
2  88  25  44  48  31   7  43  61
3  76  95  86  85  41  28  73  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. In this case, with 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's start by examining the highest valued items for each agent and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values are for items 6 (95) and 5 (82).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values are for items 4 (95) and 0 (85).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values are for items 0 (88) and 7 (61).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values are for items 1 (95) and 2 (86).

Now, let's try to distribute items so that each agent receives a fair share:

- Assign items 6 and 5 to Agent 0
- Assign items 4 and 0 to Agent 1
- Assign items 7 and 2 to Agent 2
- Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 3

This ensures each agent gets two items, and the allocations are fair based on their valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
