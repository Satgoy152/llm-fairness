Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  25  19  35  52   5  48  75
1  86  25  11  83  58  36  54  91
2  71  81  42  51  41   3  74  43
3  45  83  20  66  91  86  50  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [86 25 11 83 58 36 54 91]

 [45 83 20 66 91 86 50 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the four agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 8. In this context, fairness can be interpreted in various ways, such as maximizing the total valuation or ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

One approach is to allocate based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that have the highest valuations for this agent.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items with the next highest valuations.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items with the next set of high valuations.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items with the remaining high valuations.

Based on the valuations provided, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 5 and 7 (valuations: 5 and 75)
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 3 (valuations: 86 and 83)
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 6 (valuations: 81 and 74)
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 4 (valuations: 20 and 91)

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, maximizing their respective valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
