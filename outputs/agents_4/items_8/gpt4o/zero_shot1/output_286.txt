Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  74  35  22  46  84   0  80
1  72  38  46  26  25  51  32  66
2  35  88  46  65  51  90  45  56
3  37   8  31  76  46  20  94  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 4 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation. We will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's start by examining the highest valued items for each agent and distribute the items accordingly:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (Value: 84)
   - Second highest: Item 7 (Value: 80)
   
2. Agent 1:
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (Value: 72)
   - Second highest: Item 7 (Value: 66)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (Value: 90)
   - Second highest: Item 1 (Value: 88)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest value item: Item 6 (Value: 94)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (Value: 76)

Let's allocate based on the highest value items first:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 3 (highest value)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (second-highest value)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 0 (highest value)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 (second-highest value)

Now we have allocated 6 out of 8 items. We need to allocate 2 more items:

- For Agent 0, let's assign Item 4 (Value: 46)
- For Agent 1, let's assign Item 2 (Value: 46)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed fairly based on the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
