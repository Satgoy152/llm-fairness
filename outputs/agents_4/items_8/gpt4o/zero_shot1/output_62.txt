Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  82  62   0  36  29  23  17
1  73  46  12   3  65  46  33  99
2  80  62  86  97  89  11  84  68
3  27  85  15  44  69  17  32  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can utilize a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all 8 items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine Total Valuations**: Calculate the sum of valuations for each agent across all items to understand their overall interest.

2. **Assign Items to Agents**: Start by giving each agent the item they value the most. After the initial allocation, distribute the remaining items to maximize overall happiness.

3. **Ensure Fair Distribution**: Make sure every agent gets at least one item, adjusting allocations if necessary to maintain fairness.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items based on highest valuation. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (82). 
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (97).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 1, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 4 (69).

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Already has item 1. Next highest is item 0 (19).
- Agent 1: Has item 7. Next highest is item 4, but it's taken. Next is item 0, but it's taken. Next is item 5 (46).
- Agent 2: Has item 3. Next highest is item 2 (86).
- Agent 3: Has item 4. Next highest is item 1, but it's taken. Next is item 7, but it's taken. Next is item 6 (32).

Final check and distribution of remaining items:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 0.
- Agent 1: Items 7 and 5.
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 2.
- Agent 3: Items 4 and 6.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item. Hereâ€™s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
