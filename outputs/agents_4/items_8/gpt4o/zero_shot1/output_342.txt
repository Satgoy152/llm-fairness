Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  76  18  26  49  64   3  60
1  22   0  49  24  80  95  35  63
2  73  38  68  52  18  39  12  89
3  75  58  87  98  32  49   1  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we should try to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items that Agent 0 values highly but are not highly valued by others.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that Agent 1 values very highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Similar strategy, focusing on their top valued items.
4. **Agent 3**: Pick items that are highly valued by Agent 3 but less by others.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this item highly (73), and Agent 3 values it at 75. Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item at 76, which is higher than any other agent. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 3 values this item the most at 87. Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values this item at 98, which is the highest value. Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 80. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values this item at 95, which is the highest. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Assign this to Agent 2, who has a lower valuation of 12, but needs an item.
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 values this item the most at 89. Assign to Agent 2.

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5
- Agent 2: Items 6, 7
- Agent 3: Items 0, 2, 3

The JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
