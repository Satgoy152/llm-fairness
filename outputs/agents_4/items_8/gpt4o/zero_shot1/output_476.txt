Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  97  68  40  45   6  92  99
1  71  98  73  98  61  68  42  31
2  95  27  78  64  63  22  35   3
3  55   1  94   7  72  50  34  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. One way to approach this is to consider the maximum value each agent assigns to the items and try to allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no more than the available items.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 6, and 7.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 1, 2, 3, and 4.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 2, 3, and 4.
4. Agent 3 highly values items 2, 4, and 5.

We can allocate items in such a way that each agent receives items that they value highly, aiming to make the total value fair across agents:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4
- Agent 3: Items 5, 7

This allocation considers the highest value items for each agent and attempts to distribute the total value fairly. We ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
