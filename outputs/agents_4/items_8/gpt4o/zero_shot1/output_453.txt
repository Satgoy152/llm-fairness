Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  92  19  57  81  38  71  66
1  92  65  63  76  99  64  11  70
2   8  85  55   2  16  86  64  12
3  73   8  44  62  62  18  56  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent has for the items. One common method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it the most at 92. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it the most at 92. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it the most at 63. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it the most at 76. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it the most at 99. Assign item 4 to Agent 1. 
6. **Item 5:** Agent 2 values it the most at 86. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it the most at 71. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it the most at 66. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.

The allocation ensures that all items are distributed and agents get items based on their highest valuation. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": []
}
```
