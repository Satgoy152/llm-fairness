Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  16  55  18  30  51  75  52
1  47  50   5  70  22  31  28  77
2  92  63  31  67   7  46  73  52
3  70   7  23   7  11  24  42  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations. One approach could be to allocate some of the highest-valued items to each agent, balancing the allocation so that each agent gets a reasonable share of their highly-valued items.

Let's look at the highest valuations for each agent and allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (75), Item 2 (55), Item 0 (53)
   - Allocate Item 6 and Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (77), Item 3 (70), Item 1 (50)
   - Allocate Item 7 and Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (92), Item 1 (63), Item 3 (67)
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 3 to Agent 2. However, since Item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, we choose the next high-valued item which is Item 5 (46).
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (70), Item 7 (66), Item 6 (42)
   - Allocate Item 1 and Item 7 to Agent 3. However, since Item 7 is already allocated to Agent 1, we instead allocate the next high-valued item which is Item 4 (11).

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
