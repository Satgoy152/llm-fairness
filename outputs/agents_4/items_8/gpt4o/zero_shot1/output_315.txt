Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  54  48  20   0  87  18  58
1  19  91  69  72  15   5  59  90
2  66  80  76  43  36  37   6  15
3  89  52  63  81  47  83  37  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 7. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0, which has the highest value (87) for this agent.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 7. Let's allocate items 1 and 7 to Agent 1, where the values are 91 and 90, respectively.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 2. Item 1 is already allocated, so let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2, with a value of 76.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5. Since item 5 is already allocated, let's assign item 3 to Agent 3, with a value of 81.

5. **Remaining items**:
   - We have items 0, 4, and 6 remaining. Let's distribute these items to maximize total valuations for each agent:
     - Assign item 0 to Agent 3, with a value of 89.
     - Assign item 4 to Agent 3, with a value of 47.
     - Assign item 6 to Agent 1, with a value of 59.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 7, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 0, 4]
}
```
