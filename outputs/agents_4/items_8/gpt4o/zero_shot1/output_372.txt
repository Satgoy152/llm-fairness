Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  52  16  80  94  88  20  14
1  24  70  12  78  94  97  71   4
2  62  79  82   1  15  20   0  24
3  60  62  88  48  22  31  42  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 52 16 80 94 88 20 14]
 [24 70 12 78 94 97 71  4]
 [62 79 82  1 15 20  0 24]
 [60 62 88 48 22 31 42 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and each item is assigned to exactly one agent. Let's analyze the value table and make allocations:

Agent 0: [26, 52, 16, 80, 94, 88, 20, 14]
Agent 1: [24, 70, 12, 78, 94, 97, 71, 4]
Agent 2: [62, 79, 82, 1, 15, 20, 0, 24]
Agent 3: [60, 62, 88, 48, 22, 31, 42, 16]

We aim to allocate the items for maximum value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 94) - Agent 0 has a high valuation for this item.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 97) - Agent 1 values this item the most.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 82) - Agent 2 values this item the most.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 78) - Agent 1 also values this item highly.
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 62) - Agent 2 values this item.
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value 42) - Agent 3 values this item.
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 52) - Agent 0 values this item.
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (value 16) - Agent 3 values this item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed in a way that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```
