Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  63  37  96  94  90  44  85
1  60  25  33  83  87  28   8  56
2  19  69  98  12  30  37  85  55
3  43  58  20  18  64  42  21  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives as equal a share of total value as possible. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all items are allocated.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 71 + 63 + 37 + 96 + 94 + 90 + 44 + 85 = 580
- Agent 1: 60 + 25 + 33 + 83 + 87 + 28 + 8 + 56 = 380
- Agent 2: 19 + 69 + 98 + 12 + 30 + 37 + 85 + 55 = 405
- Agent 3: 43 + 58 + 20 + 18 + 64 + 42 + 21 + 10 = 276

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. We'll consider the highest value items for each agent first and ensure that no item is allocated more than once.

1. **Agent 0**: Values are highest for items 3 and 4. Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values are highest for items 4 and 3, but item 3 is already allocated. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, next highest.
3. **Agent 2**: Values are highest for item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values are highest for item 1, but it's already allocated. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3, next highest available.

Continuing this process, we will allocate the remaining items.

After careful allocation, the items are assigned as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 5
- Agent 1 receives item 1
- Agent 2 receives items 2, 6
- Agent 3 receives items 4, 7

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.
