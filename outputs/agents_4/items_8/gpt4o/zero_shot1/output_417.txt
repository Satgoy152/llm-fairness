Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92   3  18  55  29  75  29  22
1  18  95  13  77  63  53  81  72
2  32  58  43  32  36  12   1  76
3  77  39  99  18  32  81  12  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92  3 18 55 29 75 29 22]
 [18 95 13 77 63 53 81 72]

 [77 39 99 18 32 81 12 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets a fair share. We will attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item first, if they don't conflict with another agent's highest value.
2. Resolve any conflicts by assigning the item to the agent who values it the most and reassign the other agent(s) their next highest-valued item(s).
3. Ensure all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest value: Item 0 (92)
  
- Agent 1:
  - Highest value: Item 1 (95)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest value: Item 7 (76)

- Agent 3:
  - Highest value: Item 2 (99)

Now, we'll assign the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has Item 0.
- Agent 1 has Item 1.
- Agent 2 has Item 7.
- Agent 3 has Item 2.

Remaining items: [3, 4, 5, 6]

- Agent 0's next highest values: Item 5 (75), Item 3 (55)
- Agent 1's next highest values: Item 3 (77), Item 6 (81)
- Agent 2's next highest values: Item 4 (36), Item 5 (12)
- Agent 3's next highest values: Item 5 (81), Item 3 (18)

Resolve conflicts and assign:

- Agent 0 gets Item 5 (75)
- Agent 1 gets Item 6 (81)
- Agent 3 gets Item 3 (18)

Remaining item: Item 4

- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2, as it is their highest available option.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
