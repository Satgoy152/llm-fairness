Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  55  39   0  71  74  52  45
1  93  52  96  86  76  24   4   9
2  51   9  29  24  81  49  10  19
3  33  38  26  91  44  50   2  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [33 38 26 91 44 50  2 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items that maximize their individual total valuation, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  55  39   0  71  74  52  45
1  93  52  96  86  76  24   4   9
2  51   9  29  24  81  49  10  19
3  33  38  26  91  44  50   2  88
```

A potential allocation strategy involves ensuring each agent gets items that contribute significantly to their total valuation, trying to balance the overall satisfaction among all agents.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (74), Item 4 (71)
   - Allocate: Items 5, 4

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (93), Item 2 (96)
   - Allocate: Items 0, 2

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (81), Item 5 (49)
   - Allocate: Items 6 (10), 7 (19) [since Item 4 and 5 are taken]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 7 (88)
   - Allocate: Items 3, 7

### Final Allocation:

After considering the valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, we end up with the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuation given the constraints. Note that Agent 3 received one item due to the high valuation of item 3, and Agent 2 received items 6 and 7 due to the remaining items after higher-value items were allocated to others.
