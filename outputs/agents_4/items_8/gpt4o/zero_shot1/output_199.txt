Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  39  53  81   2  84  10  61
1  40  60   1  94  19  51  38  88
2   6  97  60   8  59  24  88  85
3  20  64  64  82  77   8  95   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and ensure that each agent gets at least one item. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Given this, let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 at 40, Agent 2 at 6, and Agent 3 at 20. Agent 1 values it the most.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 at 60, Agent 2 at 97, and Agent 3 at 64. Agent 2 values it the most.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 1, Agent 2 at 60, and Agent 3 at 64. Agent 3 values it the most.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 at 94, Agent 2 at 8, and Agent 3 at 82. Agent 1 values it the most.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 at 19, Agent 2 at 59, and Agent 3 at 77. Agent 3 values it the most.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 51, Agent 2 at 24, and Agent 3 at 8. Agent 0 values it the most.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 at 38, Agent 2 at 88, and Agent 3 at 95. Agent 3 values it the most.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 at 88, Agent 2 at 85, and Agent 3 at 9. Agent 1 values it the most.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 3, and 7.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets items 2, 4, and 6.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 3, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
