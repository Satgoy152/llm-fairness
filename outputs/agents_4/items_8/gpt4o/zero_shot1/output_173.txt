Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  44  17  92  65  48  53  44
1  83  78  64  99  98  59  25  83
2  60  33  88  28  56  29  15  52
3  44  49  72  43  65  79  23  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 44 17 92 65 48 53 44]
 [83 78 64 99 98 59 25 83]
 [60 33 88 28 56 29 15 52]
 [44 49 72 43 65 79 23 48]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the total value of the items assigned to each agent is as balanced as possible. Below is a proposed allocation that attempts to achieve this balance:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Assign items 0 and 3. The values are 83 and 92, respectively. Total value = 175.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Assign items 1 and 4. The values are 78 and 98, respectively. Total value = 176.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Assign items 2 and 7. The values are 88 and 52, respectively. Total value = 140.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Assign items 5 and 6. The values are 79 and 23, respectively. Total value = 102.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items and that the total value of the items is reasonably balanced among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
