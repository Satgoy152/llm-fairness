Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  74  71  47  88  89  97  18
1  18  50  64  48  78  14  73  27
2  83  97  44  87  39  56  74  43
3  52  37  55  82  53  30  14  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and we try to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (97), Item 5 (89), Item 4 (88)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0 (Value: 97)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (78), Item 2 (64)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (Value: 78)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (97), Item 3 (87)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (Value: 97)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (82), Item 2 (55)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3 (Value: 82)

Now we have allocated four items, and each agent has received one. We need to allocate the remaining four items:

5. **Agent 0**: 
   - Remaining high values: Item 5 (89), Item 4 (88), Item 2 (71)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0 (Value: 89)

6. **Agent 1**: 
   - Remaining high values: Item 2 (64), Item 6 (73)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (Value: 64)

7. **Agent 2**: 
   - Remaining high values: Item 0 (83), Item 6 (74)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (Value: 83)

8. **Agent 3**: 
   - Only remaining item is Item 7 (Value: 17 for Agent 3)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, while also ensuring all items are allocated.
