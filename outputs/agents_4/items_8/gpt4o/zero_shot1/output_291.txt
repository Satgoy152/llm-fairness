Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57   8  52  62  95  99  34  53
1  61  77  87   4  32  58  38  31
2  40  26  60  85  54  40   6  95
3  85  85  14  29  82   6  52  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives. A common approach is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the minimum value received by any agent.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance the values among agents:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items, then allocate items to balance these values.

Total values per agent:
- Agent 0: 57 + 8 + 52 + 62 + 95 + 99 + 34 + 53 = 460
- Agent 1: 61 + 77 + 87 + 4 + 32 + 58 + 38 + 31 = 388
- Agent 2: 40 + 26 + 60 + 85 + 54 + 40 + 6 + 95 = 406
- Agent 3: 85 + 85 + 14 + 29 + 82 + 6 + 52 + 84 = 437

2. Allocate items trying to maximize the total value for each agent, while ensuring that no agent receives too many high-value items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [5, 4] (99 + 95 = 194)
- Agent 1: [2, 1] (87 + 77 = 164)
- Agent 2: [7, 3] (95 + 85 = 180)
- Agent 3: [0, 6] (85 + 52 = 137)

3. Verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 has items [5, 4] with total value = 194
- Agent 1 has items [2, 1] with total value = 164
- Agent 2 has items [7, 3] with total value = 180
- Agent 3 has items [0, 6] with total value = 137

4. Output the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
