Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  73  72  28  69   0  19  15
1  33  45  94  71  38  17  91  74
2  30  31  85  78   1  43  25  45
3   7  84  13  45  68  52  93  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 45 94 71 38 17 91 74]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent by summing up the values they assign to all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [79, 73, 72, 28, 69, 0, 19, 15]
- Agent 1: [33, 45, 94, 71, 38, 17, 91, 74]
- Agent 2: [30, 31, 85, 78, 1, 43, 25, 45]
- Agent 3: [7, 84, 13, 45, 68, 52, 93, 74]

Now let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest value is 79 by Agent 0.
- Item 1: Highest value is 84 by Agent 3.
- Item 2: Highest value is 94 by Agent 1.
- Item 3: Highest value is 78 by Agent 2.
- Item 4: Highest value is 69 by Agent 0.
- Item 5: Highest value is 52 by Agent 3.
- Item 6: Highest value is 93 by Agent 3.
- Item 7: Highest value is 74 by Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives a fair number of items:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 4].
- Agent 1 gets items [2, 7].
- Agent 2 gets item [3].
- Agent 3 gets items [1, 5, 6].

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items and each item goes to the agent who values it the most. Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
