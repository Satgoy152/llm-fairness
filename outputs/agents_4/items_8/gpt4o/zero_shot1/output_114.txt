Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  38  69  94  55  22   7  91
1  96  89  21  89  18  53  43  76
2  51  95  30  95  39   2  88   3
3  92  39  91  76  81  23  57  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[12 38 69 94 55 22  7 91]
 [96 89 21 89 18 53 43 76]

 [92 39 91 76 81 23 57 47]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0:** 12, 38, 69, 94, 55, 22, 7, 91
- **Agent 1:** 96, 89, 21, 89, 18, 53, 43, 76
- **Agent 2:** 51, 95, 30, 95, 39, 2, 88, 3
- **Agent 3:** 92, 39, 91, 76, 81, 23, 57, 47

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0:** Prioritize items with the highest valuation.
   - Highest value is item 3 (94).
   - Second highest is item 7 (91).

2. **Agent 1:** Prioritize items with the highest valuation.
   - Highest value is item 0 (96).
   - Second highest is item 1 (89).

3. **Agent 2:** Prioritize items with the highest valuation.
   - Highest value is item 3 (95), but it's already allocated, so next highest is item 1 (95), also allocated.
   - Next, item 6 (88).

4. **Agent 3:** Prioritize items with the highest valuation.
   - Highest value is item 0 (92), already allocated.
   - Item 2 (91).

### Allocation Plan:
- **Agent 0:** Items [3, 7]
- **Agent 1:** Items [0, 1]
- **Agent 2:** Item [6]
- **Agent 3:** Item [2]

Now, we have allocated 6 of the 8 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (4 and 5).

5. **Agent 2:** Item 4 (39) is the next highest value available.
6. **Agent 3:** Item 5 (23) is the next highest value available for Agent 3.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** [3, 7]
- **Agent 1:** [0, 1]
- **Agent 2:** [6, 4]
- **Agent 3:** [2, 5]

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```
