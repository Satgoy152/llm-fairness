Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  47  14   1  43   2  39  36
1  31  67  20  39  92  70   8  20
2  45  65  66  53   6  32  79  66
3   3   3  83  52   3  82  86  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value. One approach is to use a method like the "envy-free" or "egalitarian" allocation, but since we need an integer allocation, we will try to balance the total value received by each agent as much as possible.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 1 (47) and item 4 (43).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 4 (92) and item 5 (70).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 6 (79) and item 2 (66).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 2 (83) and item 5 (82).

Using the above, we can try to assign items such that the total valuation is nearly balanced across agents:

- Agent 0: Assign item 1 (47) and item 4 (43).
- Agent 1: Assign item 0 (31) and item 3 (39).
- Agent 2: Assign item 6 (79).
- Agent 3: Assign items 2 (83), 5 (82), and 7 (35).

Now let's compile this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents, and attempts to balance the total value received by each agent.
