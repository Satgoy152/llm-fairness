Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  80  10  13  11  93  94  49
1  41  24  12  35  77  78  68  56
2  11  81  28  18  79  18  66  68
3  26  74  84   2  48  91  92  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 5 (93) and item 6 (94). Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their total value.
   
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 4 (77) and item 5 (78), but since item 5 is already allocated to Agent 0, we assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a high valuation for item 1 (81) and item 4 (79). Since item 4 is allocated to Agent 1, we assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 2 (84) and high valuation for item 5 (91) and item 6 (92). Since items 5 and 6 are allocated to Agent 0, we assign item 2 and item 7 (83) to Agent 3.

Now, let's assign the remaining items to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Already has items 5 and 6.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 4.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 1.
- **Agent 3**: Already has items 2 and 7.

Finally, we allocate the remaining items 0 and 3:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3.

This ensures each agent has a fair allocation of items based on their preferences. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents.
