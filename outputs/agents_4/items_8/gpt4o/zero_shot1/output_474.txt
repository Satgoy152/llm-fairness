Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  40  92  37  67  40  49  82
1  40  94  45  94   4  60  27  89
2  34   5  62  55  87  31  54  32
3   6  70  14  69  27   7  47  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent can get from the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets at least one item since there are 8 items and 4 agents.

Let's analyze the table and distribute the items to maximize the value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High value items: 2 (92), 0 (87), 7 (82)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High value items: 1 (94), 3 (94), 7 (89)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High value items: 4 (87), 2 (62), 3 (55)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - High value items: 7 (77), 1 (70), 3 (69)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Allocated to Agent 0 (highest value by Agent 0)
- **Item 1**: Allocated to Agent 1 (highest value by Agent 1)
- **Item 2**: Allocated to Agent 0 (highest value by Agent 0)
- **Item 3**: Allocated to Agent 1 (highest value by Agent 1)
- **Item 4**: Allocated to Agent 2 (highest value by Agent 2)
- **Item 5**: Allocated to Agent 1 (next high value not conflicting with others)
- **Item 6**: Allocated to Agent 0 (next high value not conflicting with others)
- **Item 7**: Allocated to Agent 3 (highest value by Agent 3)

This allocation tries to maximize the satisfaction for each agent based on their highest valued items while ensuring that all items are distributed.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7]
}
```
