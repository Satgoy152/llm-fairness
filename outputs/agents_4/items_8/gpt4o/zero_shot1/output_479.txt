Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  17  72  10  34  61  50  73
1  79  98   4  96  62  49   0  25
2  13  29  49  14   6  27  36  33
3  19  19  60   2  74  76  43  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the constraints, an effective approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest marginal value to each agent.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values for items are 73 (item 7), 72 (item 2), 61 (item 5).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are 98 (item 1), 96 (item 3), 79 (item 0).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are 49 (item 2), 36 (item 6), 33 (item 7).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are 76 (item 5), 74 (item 4), 60 (item 2).

To allocate fairly, let's assign items starting from the items with the highest individual values across all agents and ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

- **Item 1** to Agent 1 (value 98)
- **Item 3** to Agent 1 (value 96)
- **Item 0** to Agent 1 (value 79)

Agent 1 now has 3 items.

- **Item 7** to Agent 0 (value 73)
- **Item 2** to Agent 0 (value 72)

Agent 0 now has 2 items.

- **Item 5** to Agent 3 (value 76)
- **Item 4** to Agent 3 (value 74)

Agent 3 now has 2 items.

- **Item 6** to Agent 2 (value 36)

Agent 2 now has 1 item.

This ensures all 8 items are allocated fairly. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 4]
}
```
