Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37   3  86  21  38  75  68  97
1  87  95  23  66  33  42  14  36
2  30  17  48  85  25  74  52  70
3  31  27  94  60  80  78  98  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

One approach to achieve this is to use a method called "round-robin" allocation, where we iterate through the agents and assign them the highest valued item available at each step. However, since we need to allocate exactly 8 items to 4 agents, we will ensure that each agent gets exactly 2 items (since 8 items / 4 agents = 2 items per agent).

Here is a step-by-step allocation using this approach:

1. Agent 0: Highest available values are 97 and 86. Assign items 7 and 2.
2. Agent 1: Highest available values are 95 and 87. Assign items 1 and 0.
3. Agent 2: Highest available values are 85 and 74. Assign items 3 and 5.
4. Agent 3: Highest available values are 98 and 94. Assign items 6 and 4.

After allocation, ensure each agent has exactly 2 items, and all items are allocated.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [6, 4]
}
```
