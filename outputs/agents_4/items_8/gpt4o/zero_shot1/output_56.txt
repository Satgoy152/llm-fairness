Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  34  34  22  26   6  48  17
1  30  14  53  70  60  44  88  46
2  28  67  42  71   9  20  64  59
3  95  59  12  21  25  43  40  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will consider each agent's highest-value items and try to distribute the items in a balanced manner, ensuring that every agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's start by identifying the highest-value items for each agent:

- Agent 0: Highest values are for items 0 (77), 2 (34), and 1 (34).
- Agent 1: Highest values are for items 6 (88), 3 (70), and 4 (60).
- Agent 2: Highest values are for items 3 (71), 1 (67), and 7 (59).
- Agent 3: Highest values are for items 0 (95), 7 (83), and 1 (59).

Now, considering these values, let's assign the items:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 3, as it has the highest value there.
2. Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value there.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value there.
4. Assign item 7 to Agent 3, as it is the next highest value.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it has a high value there and Agent 2 hasn't received a second item yet.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 needs an item and it values this item next highest.
7. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is one of the higher values left for Agent 1.
8. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it is the next available item and Agent 0 needs a second item.

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of items according to the agents' preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
