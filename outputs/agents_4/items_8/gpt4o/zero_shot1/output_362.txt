Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  29  80  93  61  83  88  45
1  20  38  95  59  86  34  53  79
2  61  52  76  65  13   7  82  28
3  72  77  94  85  20  47  20  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's a potential allocation that aims to spread the value fairly:

1. **Agent 0** is given items 0, 3, and 6, which have values of 22, 93, and 88 respectively. Total value = 203.
2. **Agent 1** is given items 2 and 7, which have values of 95 and 79 respectively. Total value = 174.
3. **Agent 2** is given item 5, which has a value of 7. Total value = 7.
4. **Agent 3** is given items 1 and 4, which have values of 77 and 20 respectively. Total value = 97.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items, and the distribution of value attempts to balance fairness among agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items in total, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.
