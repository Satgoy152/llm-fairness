Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  72   9  52  17  99  20  23
1  83  34  36  63  49  71  97  30
2  14  51  44  95  72  82  12  64
3  66  59  80  66  71  46   3  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 34 36 63 49 71 97 30]

 [66 59 80 66 71 46  3 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We'll assign items primarily based on the highest value each agent assigns to them. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 5 has a value of 99, which is the highest for Agent 0. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0 has a value of 83, which is the highest for Agent 1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 3 has a value of 95, which is the highest for Agent 2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 7 has a value of 88, which is the highest for Agent 3. Assign item 7 to Agent 3.

Now, let's assign the remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1 has a value of 72. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 6 has a value of 97. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 has a value of 72. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 2 has a value of 80. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items have been allocated. Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [7, 2]
}
```
