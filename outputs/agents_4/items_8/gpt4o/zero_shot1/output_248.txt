Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  94  16  37  55  75   3  81
1  83  63  69  41  64  67  65  72
2  66  18  44  65  52  42   6  20
3  38   8  82  39  99  18  29  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to maximize the total sum of valuations while balancing the number of items each agent receives as evenly as possible, given there are constraints.

Below is one possible allocation where each agent is assigned two items, ensuring all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 1 - These items have high valuations for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Items 5 and 7 - These items have relatively high valuations for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Items 3 and 4 - These items have high valuations for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Items 2 and 6 - These items have relatively high valuations for Agent 3.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```

This distribution allocates all 8 items fairly, ensuring each agent receives two items, and the allocation aims to optimize the value each agent gets from the items they receive.
