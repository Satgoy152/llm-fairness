Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  40  49  43  27  72  90  73
1  29  91  79  55  85  28  60  49
2  95   1  80  70  38  73  26  51
3  32  35  94  86  42  44   9  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to maximize the overall utility by trying to assign items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the valuations and try to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 6 (90), Item 5 (72), Item 7 (73)
   - Let's assign Item 6 to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued item for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (91), Item 4 (85), Item 2 (79)
   - Let's assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it is the highest valued item for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 0 (95), Item 2 (80), Item 5 (73)
   - Let's assign Item 0 to Agent 2, as it is the highest valued item for Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (94), Item 3 (86), Item 7 (67)
   - Let's assign Item 2 to Agent 3, as it is the highest valued item for Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated the highest valued items for each agent's strongest preference. Each agent should ideally get two items to ensure fairness, so let's proceed with the next highest preferences:

5. **Agent 0** (next highest): Item 7 (73)
6. **Agent 1** (next highest): Item 4 (85)
7. **Agent 2** (next highest): Item 5 (73)
8. **Agent 3** (next highest): Item 3 (86)

This ensures each agent receives two items, and the allocations are balanced based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
