Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  31  61  54  23   2  26  63
1  68  98  21  76  36   4  65  87
2  64  22  97  65  54  29   5  77
3  78  79  42  60  55  91  86  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction or value each agent receives from their allocated items. One common method for such allocations is to use the maximum sum allocation, where we assign items to agents such that the total value across all agents is maximized.

Given the valuations, we can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s how we can proceed:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 78.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 98.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 97.

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 76.

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 55.

6. **Item 5:** 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 91.

7. **Item 6:** 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 86.

8. **Item 7:** 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 63.

After this direct assignment, we have:
- Agent 0 receives item 7.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives items 0, 4, 5, and 6.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are assigned. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.
