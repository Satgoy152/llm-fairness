Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  87  97   8  90  78  67  95
1  98  25  16  66  66  94  51  23
2  88  38  11  17  55  99  93  88
3  43  66  66  92  96  90  71   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's preferences and ensure that all items are allocated without any duplication. This is a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of agents based on their valuations. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Assign the item with the highest value for each agent**: This ensures that each agent gets at least one item they highly value.
2. **Distribute remaining items**: Look for unallocated items and assign them to agents who value them highly, ensuring no agent receives more than necessary.

Following this approach, we can derive the following allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (value 97), item 7 (value 95). 
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (value 98).
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (value 99).
- Agent 3 highly values item 4 (value 96).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 0 (value 87).
- Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 3 (value 92).
- Item 6 is highly valued by Agent 2 (value 93).

After considering the above, a possible fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and all items are allocated.
