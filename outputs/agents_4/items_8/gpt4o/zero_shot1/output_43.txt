Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  99  43  40  71   0  44  81
1   6  52  22  57  81  22  32  26
2   4   7  68  38   9  20  88   7
3  42  49  88  10  74  33  85  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. One approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: [1 (99), 4 (71), 7 (81)]
   - Agent 1: [4 (81), 3 (57), 1 (52)]
   - Agent 2: [6 (88), 2 (68), 5 (20)]
   - Agent 3: [2 (88), 4 (74), 6 (85)]

2. **Allocate items based on maximum valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:**

   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1 and second-highest for Agent 3).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for Agent 2 and second-highest for Agent 3).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for Agent 3).

3. **Allocate remaining items:**

   - Items left: 0, 3, 5, 7.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation for Agent 3).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation for Agent 2).

4. **Ensure total allocation is exactly 8 items:**

   - Agent 0: Items [1, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [4, 3]
   - Agent 2: Items [6, 5]
   - Agent 3: Items [2, 0]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [2, 0]
}
```
