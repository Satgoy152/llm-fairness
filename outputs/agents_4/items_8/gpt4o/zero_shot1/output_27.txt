Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  14  48  81  62  37  83  76
1  47   1  36  77  58  38   9  39
2  72  31  57  45   2  83   0  21
3  22   0  33  53  41  50  21  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we should aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item Across All Agents:**
   - Item 0: 32 + 47 + 72 + 22 = 173
   - Item 1: 14 + 1 + 31 + 0 = 46
   - Item 2: 48 + 36 + 57 + 33 = 174
   - Item 3: 81 + 77 + 45 + 53 = 256
   - Item 4: 62 + 58 + 2 + 41 = 163
   - Item 5: 37 + 38 + 83 + 50 = 208
   - Item 6: 83 + 9 + 0 + 21 = 113
   - Item 7: 76 + 39 + 21 + 74 = 210

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Fairness:**
   - Aim to balance the total value received by each agent.
   - Consider the highest valuations an agent has for the items.

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Preferences:**
   - Agent 0: Highest preferences are items 3 (81) and 6 (83).
   - Agent 1: Highest preferences are items 3 (77) and 0 (47).
   - Agent 2: Highest preferences are items 5 (83) and 0 (72).
   - Agent 3: Highest preferences are items 7 (74) and 5 (50).

4. **Adjust Allocations to Balance Total Value:**
   - Allocate items to ensure each agent gets a fair share of total value.
   - Adjust based on initial high-value item preferences.

Let's make the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers the preferences and aims to distribute the total value as evenly as possible among the agents. Each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated.
