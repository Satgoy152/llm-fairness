Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43   6  70  18  41  70  30  55
1  17   3  22  42  84   2  64   4
2  39  75  42  39  13  35  32  78
3   0  88  33  93  91   3  98  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider their valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction among all agents. One possible approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also ensuring that every item is allocated to one of the agents.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly (70), so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (84), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly (75), so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 highly (98), so allocate item 6 to agent 3.

Now, we have 4 more items to allocate (0, 3, 5, 7). We can continue by allocating these items based on remaining high valuations:

5. Agent 3 values item 3 highly (93), so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
6. Agent 0 values item 5 highly (70), so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
7. Agent 2 values item 7 highly (78), so allocate item 7 to agent 2.
8. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (43), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.

Now, each item is allocated, and the agents are fairly satisfied based on their highest valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
