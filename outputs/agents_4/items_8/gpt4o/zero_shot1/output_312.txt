Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  71  71  12  45  70  80   4
1  10  33  78   0  69  36  31  83
2  90  57  35  71  71   5   8  17
3  98  26  23  36  52  78  42  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. Below is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** Determine which items each agent values highly and try to allocate those items to them if possible.

2. **Ensure Fair Distribution:** Ensure that each agent gets at least one item to maintain fairness.

3. **Balance the Total Value:** Try to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Values item 6 highly (80).
  - Also values item 0 (69) and item 1 (71).

- **Agent 1:**
  - Values item 7 highly (83).
  - Also values item 2 (78) and item 4 (69).

- **Agent 2:**
  - Values item 0 highly (90).
  - Also values item 3 (71).

- **Agent 3:**
  - Values item 0 highly (98).
  - Also values item 5 (78).

**Allocation:**

- Give item 6 to Agent 0.
- Give item 7 to Agent 1.
- Give item 0 to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 values it the most).
- Give item 3 to Agent 2.
- Give item 5 to Agent 3.
- Give item 1 to Agent 0.
- Give item 2 to Agent 1.
- Give item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while distributing the items fairly among all agents.
