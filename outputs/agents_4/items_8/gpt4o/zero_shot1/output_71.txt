Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  11  70  47  41  37  71  66
1  62  16  51  45  90  68  33  88
2  15  58  37  30  74  32  71  22
3   1  99  16  66  64  97  46   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 4 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Below is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
    - There are 4 agents and 8 items, so on average, each agent should get 2 items.
    - We should prioritize giving items to agents who value them the most.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Values**:
    - First, identify the highest value each agent has for any item and allocate accordingly.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**:
    - Ensure each agent has approximately the same number of items, which should ideally be 2.
    - Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure fairness while maintaining high total valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest values: Item 6 (71) and Item 2 (70)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest values: Item 4 (90) and Item 7 (88)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest values: Item 4 (74) and Item 0 (15)
  - Since Item 4 is already taken by Agent 1, allocate Items 5 (32) and 6 (71)

- **Agent 3**:
  - Highest values: Item 1 (99) and Item 5 (97)
  - Since Item 5 is already taken by Agent 2, allocate Item 3 (66)

### Final Allocations

After reallocating to ensure all items are assigned and each agent has approximately 2 items, we have the following fair distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly while maintaining fairness in the number of items allocated.
