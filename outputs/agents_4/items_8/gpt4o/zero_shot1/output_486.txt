Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  69  43  96  77   2  83  81
1  56  73  87  66  23  84  49  46
2   4  68  27   9  76  48  50  87
3  67  43  12   5  12  78   9  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

One possible strategy is to use a greedy approach, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 67.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 69.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 87.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 77.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 84.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 83.
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 87.

Now, let's check if the allocations are fair and adjust if necessary to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Item 0

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0]
}
```
