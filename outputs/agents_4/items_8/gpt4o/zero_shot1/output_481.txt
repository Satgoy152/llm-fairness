Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  76  72  95  16   0  89  78
1   3  55  20  75   6  87  87  43
2  92  18  39  71  74  30  81  79
3  45  73  50  66  65  44  72   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider distributing the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent. We can use a greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item and ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign agent 2 the item with the highest value for them: item 0 (value 92).
- Assign agent 0 the item with the highest value for them: item 3 (value 95).
- Assign agent 3 the item with the highest value for them: item 1 (value 73).
- Assign agent 1 the item with the highest value for them: item 5 (value 87).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Assign agent 0 item 6 (value 89).
- Assign agent 2 item 7 (value 79).
- Assign agent 3 item 4 (value 65).
- Assign agent 1 item 2 (value 20).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the total of 8 items is distributed among the agents.
