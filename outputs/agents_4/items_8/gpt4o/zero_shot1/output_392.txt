Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  13  60   7  59  44  32  29
1  63  92  31  29  37  19   4  74
2  59   5  77  74  43  68  22  56
3  48  82  86  53   2  91  95  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items with values that are as balanced as possible. Given the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items, we can use a greedy approach to maximize the total perceived value for each agent.

Let's begin by allocating the items as follows:

1. Sort all items based on their value for each agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Following this approach, we will allocate the items to the agents:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Highest: Item 2 (value 60)
  - Second: Item 4 (value 59)

- Agent 1 values:
  - Highest: Item 1 (value 92)
  - Second: Item 0 (value 63)

- Agent 2 values:
  - Highest: Item 2 (value 77)
  - Second: Item 3 (value 74)

- Agent 3 values:
  - Highest: Item 7 (value 98)
  - Second: Item 6 (value 95)
  - Third: Item 5 (value 91)

Let's distribute the items:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 1, Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2, Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 5, Item 6, Item 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is based on the highest valuations. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
