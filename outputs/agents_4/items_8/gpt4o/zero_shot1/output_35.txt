Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  63  64  68  40   5  53  65
1  96  98  68  69  24  46  57  54
2  90  40  88  67  19  69  10  37
3  95  94  44  78  87  66  43   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. We can aim for a balanced distribution by considering the valuations. Here's one approach to fairly allocate the items based on their valuations:

1. Start by allocating items to the agents based on the highest valuation for each item.
2. Ensure that each agent has an approximately equal number of items.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

- Item 0: The highest valuation is from agent 1 (96).
- Item 1: The highest valuation is from agent 1 (98).
- Item 2: The highest valuation is from agent 2 (88).
- Item 3: The highest valuation is from agent 3 (78).
- Item 4: The highest valuation is from agent 3 (87).
- Item 5: The highest valuation is from agent 2 (69).
- Item 6: The highest valuation is from agent 0 (53).
- Item 7: The highest valuation is from agent 0 (65).

Now we allocate these items bearing in mind the balance:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
