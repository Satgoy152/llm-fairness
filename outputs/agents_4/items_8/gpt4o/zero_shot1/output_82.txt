Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  98  42  64  30  83  98  79
1  61  45  52  85  69  59  48   6
2  86  18  54  60  11  65  24  72
3   8  50   8  98  94   6   9  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value and that all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: We can sum up the values each agent assigns to all items. This helps us understand each agent's preferences.

2. **Assign High-Value Items**: We can assign items that have high values for specific agents, ensuring that the total value received by each agent is maximized.

3. **Ensure Each Agent Gets at Least One Item**: Since the problem does not specify how many items each agent should receive, we can start by ensuring each agent has at least one item, then distribute the remaining items based on maximizing total value.

4. **Final Allocation**: We will check if all items are allocated and adjust if necessary to ensure all agents are treated fairly.

Let's execute this plan:

- **Agent 0**: Values are [18, 98, 42, 64, 30, 83, 98, 79]
- **Agent 1**: Values are [61, 45, 52, 85, 69, 59, 48, 6]
- **Agent 2**: Values are [86, 18, 54, 60, 11, 65, 24, 72]
- **Agent 3**: Values are [8, 50, 8, 98, 94, 6, 9, 99]

The total value for each agent across all items is:
- **Agent 0**: 512
- **Agent 1**: 425
- **Agent 2**: 390
- **Agent 3**: 372

**Initial Allocation Based on Highest Values**:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 98)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 98)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 86)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 94)

**Remaining Items**: 2, 5, 6, 7

**Final Allocation**:
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 83)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 52)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 98)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (value 99)

The allocation ensures a fair distribution of high-value items and reasonably balances the overall value received by each agent.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format**:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest values, and all items are distributed.
