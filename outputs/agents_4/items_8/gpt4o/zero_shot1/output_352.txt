Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  15  63  65  17  25  18  68
1  36  11  21  70  93   7  21  14
2  37  96  64  39  26   8  79  54
3  33  18  14  89   7  58  44  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to consider the preferences and valuations of each agent while ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible. The goal is to maximize overall satisfaction while distributing the items evenly.

Let's consider a few strategies for allocation:

1. **Highest Valuation Strategy**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This could lead to some agents receiving more items than others, so adjustments may be needed.

2. **Balanced Allocation Strategy**: Attempt to distribute the items so that each agent gets approximately the same number of items, prioritizing the items they value most.

Using a balanced approach, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 highly values item 4.
- Agent 2 highly values item 1 and item 6.
- Agent 3 highly values item 3 and item 5.

To ensure a fair distribution, we aim to allocate 2 items to each agent since there are 8 items and 4 agents.

**Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 6
- **Agent 3**: Items 5, 7

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and the items are distributed based on relatively high valuations for each agent.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
