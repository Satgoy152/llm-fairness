Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  43  40  79   7  25  40  25
1  93  70  10  45  67  41   6  45
2  84  77  15   4  97  16  50  29
3  44  59  41  13  41  70  89  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that considers the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

A simple method is to use a greedy allocation strategy, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 93, which is the highest among all agents.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 1.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 2 values it at 77, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 40, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 0.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 2 values it at 97, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 2.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 3 values it at 70, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 3.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 3 values it at 89, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 6 to agent 3.

8. Item 7:
   - Agent 3 values it at 91, which is the highest.
   - Assign item 7 to agent 3.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
