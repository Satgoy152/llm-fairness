Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  63  18  53  47   3  39  25
1  51  32  42  19  24  74   2  69
2  16  65  50  26  33  72  37  92
3  25  63   0  69  55  40  79   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent places on the items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 51.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest at 65.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 42.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the highest at 69.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the highest at 55.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the highest at 74.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the highest at 79.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the highest at 92.

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 5 and 7.
- Agent 3 receives items 3, 4, and 6.

However, upon re-evaluating, we find that Agent 0 currently has no items, so let's adjust:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 7.
- Agent 3 receives items 3, 4, and 6.

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item, and the overall satisfaction is maximized based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
