Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44   8  45  73  84  91  34  66
1  98   7  79  68  91  95  27  49
2  54  64  37  60  40   9  62  88
3  91  30   4  68  51  97  99  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44  8 45 73 84 91 34 66]
 [98  7 79 68 91 95 27 49]
 [54 64 37 60 40  9 62 88]
 [91 30  4 68 51 97 99 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy such as maximizing the total valuation of items for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This approach seeks to create a balanced allocation that respects the valuations in the table.

To achieve this, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items so that the total value received by each agent is balanced.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and no item is allocated more than once.
4. Make sure that exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

Here's one possible allocation based on the provided table:

- Agent 0 gets items: 4, 7
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 5
- Agent 2 gets items: 2, 6
- Agent 3 gets items: 1, 3

This allocation ensures that all agents receive an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
