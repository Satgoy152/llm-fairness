Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  95  95  43  16  67   9  23
1  82  17  59   1  23  75  65  15
2  54  38  96  78  27  83  76  86
3  54  65  22  49  66  68  78   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve the allocation:

1. **Consider the Highest Valuations**: Start by considering the highest valuations for each item and try to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual satisfaction.

2. **Balance the Number of Items**: Ensure each agent receives exactly 2 items, as there are 8 items and 4 agents.

3. **Check for Fairness**: Ensure that the allocation is fair by checking if any agent could be significantly better off by exchanging items with another.

Let's go through the table and try to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5 and a decent valuation for item 6. Assign items 5 and 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 7. Assign items 2 and 7 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 can then receive items 3 and 4, which gives them items with reasonable valuations.

This allocation ensures each agent gets 2 items and respects their preferences as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
