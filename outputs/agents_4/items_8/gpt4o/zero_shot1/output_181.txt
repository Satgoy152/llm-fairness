Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  96  52  74  19  88  53  47
1   0  93  36  17  97  30   2  65
2  18  12  92  53  80  57  80  99
3  53  45  43  54  49  87  49  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the preferences each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, given that there are 8 items and 4 agents.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for item 1 (96) and item 5 (88).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (97) the most.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for item 7 (99) and item 2 (92).
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 (87) and item 7 (77) highly.

A possible allocation strategy based on the highest values for each agent could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

This covers the top preferences for each agent, but we need to allocate the remaining items considering the next highest preferences:

- Agent 0 also values item 2 (52), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has item 3 (17) as the next highest preference, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 can get item 6 (80), since they also value it highly.
- Agent 3 can have item 0 (53), which is their next highest preference.

Now, we have allocated all 8 items. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while evenly distributing the total items among the agents.
