Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  99   4  44  22  94  20  83
1  18  57  87  29   0  18  41  12
2  77  46   6  13   1  75   9  63
3  96  77  36   3  46  15  53  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - High values: Item 1 (99), Item 5 (94), Item 7 (83), Item 0 (77)

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - High values: Item 2 (87), Item 1 (57), Item 6 (41)

3. **Agent 2's Valuation:**
   - High values: Item 0 (77), Item 5 (75), Item 7 (63)

4. **Agent 3's Valuation:**
   - High values: Item 0 (96), Item 1 (77), Item 6 (53)

Based on these valuations, we attempt to allocate items by giving priority to the agent with the highest value for each item, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no item is allocated more than once.

### Allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Highest value for Agent 3 (96)
   - Allocate to Agent 3

2. **Item 1:**
   - Highest value for Agent 0 (99)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2:**
   - Highest value for Agent 1 (87)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

4. **Item 3:**
   - Lowest overall value; allocate to Agent 1 (29)

5. **Item 4:**
   - Allocate to Agent 3 (46)

6. **Item 5:**
   - Highest value for Agent 0 (94)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

7. **Item 6:**
   - Highest value for Agent 3 (53)
   - Allocate to Agent 3

8. **Item 7:**
   - Highest value for Agent 0 (83)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

### Resulting Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the total number of allocated items equals 8. Agent 2 receives no items because their highest values are lower compared to those of other agents for the same items.
