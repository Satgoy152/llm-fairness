Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  26  18  52  60  58   6  21
1  75  86  75  94  14  56  41  87
2  19  50  14   5  36  52  46   4
3  92  66  83  63  22   4  32  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We'll start by analyzing the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 4 and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 3 and 7.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively high valuation for item 6.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for items 0 and 2.

Based on this approach, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 4, 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 7
- **Agent 2**: Item 6
- **Agent 3**: Items 0, 2, 1

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.
