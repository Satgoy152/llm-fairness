Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  18  53  87   4  60  76  77
1  82  44  53  44  58  50  32  86
2  45  81  48  60  36  36  99  29
3  24  56  46  69   2   9  77  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize fairness based on the given valuations. One approach is to ensure each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and that the distribution overall tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 (96) and also values items 3 (87) and 7 (77) highly. We can allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 7 highly (86) and also item 4 (58). Let's allocate items 7 and 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 6 (99) and a decent valuation for item 1 (81). Allocate items 6 and 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Left with items 2 and 5, which are not the highest valued by any agent, but Agent 3 can take these remaining items.

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share based on their highest-valued items while ensuring all items are distributed among the agents.

Here is the proposed allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
