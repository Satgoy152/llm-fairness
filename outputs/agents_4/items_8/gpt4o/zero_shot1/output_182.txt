Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  82  87  54  11  44  28  25
1  13  95  52   1  22  96  49  20
2  72  22  35  26  83  99  81  31
3  34  64  29  31  12  33  55  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A reasonable approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation preference of each agent, balancing the distribution.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Preferences:**
   - Each agent's valuation for each item is considered.
   - We aim to maximize the individual satisfaction by considering high-value items for each agent.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Prioritize items based on agents' highest valuations, ensuring that once an item is allocated, it is not reassigned.
   - Try to distribute the total number of items (8) as evenly as possible among the 4 agents.

3. **Ensure Fairness:**
   - Each agent should have a reasonable share of total items, even if the exact number varies slightly (e.g., some agents might get 2 items while others get 1).

Using this method, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2] (high valuation items for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5] (high valuation items for agent 1)
- Agent 2: Items [4, 6] (high valuation items for agent 2)
- Agent 3: Items [3, 7] (remaining items)

This allocation attempts to distribute items to maximize individual agent satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
