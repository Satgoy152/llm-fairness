Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  58   5  97   1  65  34   4
1  24  30  14  86   6  60  61  13
2  26  69  55  79  56  54   2  20
3  31  78  62  54   9  78  72  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0 and 3. Allocating these items maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a relatively high valuation for item 6. Allocating this item to them increases their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a high valuation for item 1. Allocating this item maximizes their satisfaction.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent has high valuations for items 7 and 5. Allocating these items maximizes their satisfaction.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items such that the overall satisfaction is maximized:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 as they have a relatively higher valuation for it compared to other agents.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 since they have a slightly higher valuation for it compared to others who haven't been allocated as many high-value items.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the agents, aiming to balance the total satisfaction across them based on their valuations.
