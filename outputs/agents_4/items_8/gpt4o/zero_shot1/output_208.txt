Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21   9  57   5  19  78  51  23
1   6  81  40  51  58  41   7  44
2  54  72  77  31  13  21  22  37
3  69  67  79  32  63  58  76  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy where we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. One way to achieve this is to follow a greedy strategy, where we allocate the item with the highest value to an agent, and then repeat this process until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 7 (value: 98).
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 5 (value: 78).
3. **Agent 3** has the highest remaining valuation for item 2 (value: 79).
4. **Agent 2** has the highest remaining valuation for item 1 (value: 72).
5. **Agent 3** has the highest remaining valuation for item 0 (value: 69).
6. **Agent 1** has the highest remaining valuation for item 4 (value: 58).
7. **Agent 3** has the highest remaining valuation for item 6 (value: 76).
8. **Agent 1** has the highest remaining valuation for item 3 (value: 51).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent is satisfied with their highest available valuation items, and all 8 items are allocated.
