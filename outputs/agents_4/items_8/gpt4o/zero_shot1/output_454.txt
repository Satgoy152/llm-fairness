Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  38  73  75  71  99  65  85
1  56  84  26  71  78  53  77  22
2  11  60  77  31  27   7  14  42
3  92  81  51  85  66  48  67  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73 38 73 75 71 99 65 85]
 [56 84 26 71 78 53 77 22]
 [11 60 77 31 27  7 14 42]
 [92 81 51 85 66 48 67 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here, I'll provide a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** This agent has high values for items 0, 2, and 3. Let's give them items 0 and 3.
2. **Agent 1:** This agent values item 1 the highest. Let's give them items 1 and 4.
3. **Agent 2:** This agent values item 2 the highest. Let's give them item 2.
4. **Agent 3:** This agent values items 5 and 7 fairly well. Let's give them items 5, 6, and 7.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.
