Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  22  56  16  66  34  32  57
1  96  84  42  73   9  60  45  86
2  94  29  94  44  33  74  18  51
3  18  74  67  17  66  92  59  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. This approach will ensure that the distribution is as equitable as possible based on the valuations provided.

Let's examine each agent's valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (66), Item 2 (56), Item 7 (57)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 7 (86), Item 1 (84)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (94), Item 2 (94), Item 5 (74)
   
4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (92), Item 1 (74), Item 6 (59)

Now, let's allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated:

- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for Item 0 (96), so assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** has a high valuation for Item 4 (66), so assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 2** has a high valuation for Item 2 (94), so assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for Item 5 (92), so assign Item 5 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 1** has a high valuation for Item 7 (86), so assign Item 7 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** has a high valuation for Item 6 (32), so assign Item 6 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 3** has a high valuation for Item 1 (74), so assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 2** has a valuation for Item 3 (44), so assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

After this allocation, each agent has been assigned items based on their highest valuations, and all 8 items have been allocated. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5, 1]
}
```
