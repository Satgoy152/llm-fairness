Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  76  49  52  86  90   2  45
1  43  20  88  25  92  48  78   6
2  21  29  27  97  22  50  75  36
3  12  88  25  95  42   7  12  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, let's aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest value for Agent 0 is 90 (item 5).
2. **Agent 1:** The highest value for Agent 1 is 92 (item 4).
3. **Agent 2:** The highest value for Agent 2 is 97 (item 3).
4. **Agent 3:** The highest value for Agent 3 is 88 (item 1).

After allocating these items, we have allocated four items, and each agent has at least one item. We need to allocate the remaining four items. Let's choose the remaining items to maximize the total values for each agent:

5. **Agent 0:** The second highest value for Agent 0 is 86 (item 4). Since item 4 is already taken, we move to 76 (item 1), which is also taken, so next is 52 (item 3) which is also taken. Thus, we allocate item 0 to Agent 0 which has a value of 51.
6. **Agent 1:** The next highest value for Agent 1 is 88 (item 2).
7. **Agent 2:** The next highest value for Agent 2 is 75 (item 6).
8. **Agent 3:** The next highest value for Agent 3 is 63 (item 7).

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
