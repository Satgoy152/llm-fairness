Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  31  23  88  87  98  47  82
1  30  90   2  25  90   0  98  69
2  23  54  71  54  69  90  63  26
3  23  77  21  89   6   4  44  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuations: Item 0 (87), Item 3 (88), Item 5 (98), Item 7 (82)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuations: Item 1 (90), Item 4 (90), Item 6 (98)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuations: Item 2 (71), Item 5 (90)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - High valuations: Item 3 (89), Item 1 (77)

Considering these preferences, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Allocate items with high values that are not the absolute highest for others to balance the distribution.
  - Items to allocate: [0, 3, 7] (Values: 87, 88, 82)

- Agent 1: Allocate items where Agent 1 has the highest or second-highest valuation.
  - Items to allocate: [1, 4] (Values: 90, 90)

- Agent 2: Allocate high-value items, especially those not prioritized by others.
  - Items to allocate: [2, 5] (Values: 71, 90)

- Agent 3: Allocate remaining high-value items.
  - Items to allocate: [6] (Value: 44)

Re-evaluate to ensure all items are allocated and no agent gets too many items:

- Total items allocated: 8 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- Each agent has 1-3 items, which is fairly balanced.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, considering each agent's preferences, while maintaining a balanced allocation.
