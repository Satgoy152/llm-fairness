Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  62  57  15  99  23   4  23
1  44  51  15  79  94  58  60  39
2  80  18   2  74  51  66  84  53
3  43  74  42  20   2  17  20  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4. We allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 highly, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has decent valuations for items 5 and 7, which we allocate to Agent 3.

Now let's check if all items are allocated:

- Items allocated to Agent 0: 0, 1, 4 (3 items)
- Item allocated to Agent 1: 3 (1 item)
- Item allocated to Agent 2: 6 (1 item)
- Items allocated to Agent 3: 5, 7 (2 items)

Total items allocated: 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7

It seems I miscalculated the total number of items. We have allocated only 7 items but need to allocate 8. Let's adjust the allocation to make sure all 8 items are given out:

1. Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4
2. Agent 1: Items 3, 2
3. Agent 2: Item 6
4. Agent 3: Items 5, 7

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible while maintaining fairness in distribution.
