Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  56  24  93  45  32  51   2
1  53  74  49   2  70  51  90   3
2  88  28  19  15  11  24  40  60
3  52  42  60  52  93  49   2  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for a balanced distribution based on preferences. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 3 the highest (93). Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 6 the highest (90). Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 the highest (88). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 4 the highest (93). Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

5. **Agent 0**: After item 3, agent 0 values item 1 the second highest (56). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**: After item 6, agent 1 values item 4 the second highest, but it is already allocated. The next highest is item 5 (51). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**: After item 0, agent 2 values item 7 the second highest (60). Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3**: After item 4, agent 3 values item 2 the second highest (60). Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items based on their preferences as much as possible. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [4, 2]
}
```
