Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  56  56  31  17  68  39  63
1  82  81  62  14   6  23  93  12
2   6  46  92  99  80  49  54  39
3  48  80  63  47  46  41  84   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we can try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally get 2 items. Here's a potential allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value = 73
   - Item 7: Value = 63
   
   Total Value for Agent 0 = 73 + 63 = 136

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 6: Value = 93
   - Item 1: Value = 81
   
   Total Value for Agent 1 = 93 + 81 = 174

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2: Value = 92
   - Item 3: Value = 99
   
   Total Value for Agent 2 = 92 + 99 = 191

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 4: Value = 46
   - Item 5: Value = 41
   
   Total Value for Agent 3 = 46 + 41 = 87

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while giving each agent an integer number of items. Below is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```
