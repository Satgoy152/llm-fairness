Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  75  39   1  48  89  96   4
1  91  47  85  37  23  29  99  76
2   6  61  54  21  14  97  70  96
3  33  97  39  15  41  27  85  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Here's one way to assign the items:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for the items and try to allocate accordingly.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, as long as the total number of items allocated stays at 8.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0's highest values are for items: 6 (96), 5 (89)
- Agent 1's highest values are for items: 6 (99), 0 (91), 2 (85)
- Agent 2's highest values are for items: 5 (97), 6 (70), 7 (96)
- Agent 3's highest values are for items: 1 (97), 6 (85)

With this in mind, we can attempt an allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 5 (89) and 0 (68)
- Agent 1: Allocate items 6 (99) and 2 (85)
- Agent 2: Allocate item 7 (96)
- Agent 3: Allocate items 1 (97), 3 (15), and 4 (41)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and the distribution aims to respect the preferences indicated by the valuations as closely as possible given the constraints.
