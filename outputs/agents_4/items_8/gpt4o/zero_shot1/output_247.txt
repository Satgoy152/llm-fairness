Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  86  94  49   0  72  20   7
1  44  92  95  71  81   4  55  58
2  27  28  68   2  75  93  71  44
3   0  12  49  92  35  37  84  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the total valuation and balance the distribution of items among the agents. We want to ensure that the allocations reflect the agents' preferences as much as possible.

Let's examine the valuations for each item and assign them to the agent who values them the most, keeping the distribution of items balanced:

1. Analyze the highest valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: Highest value is 44 by Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Highest value is 92 by Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Highest value is 95 by Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Highest value is 92 by Agent 3.
   - Item 4: Highest value is 81 by Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Highest value is 93 by Agent 2.
   - Item 6: Highest value is 84 by Agent 3.
   - Item 7: Highest value is 73 by Agent 3.

2. Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuations while maintaining a fair distribution:
   - Agent 0: No highest valuations, but we need to ensure all agents get at least one item.
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2, 4
   - Agent 2: Item 5
   - Agent 3: Items 3, 6, 7

3. Adjust to ensure each agent has at least one item and the total is 8:
   - Move Item 0 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 to ensure Agent 0 receives at least one item.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6, 7

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6, 7]
}
```
