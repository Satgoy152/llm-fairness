Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  61  11  48  99   1  64  40
1  78   4  46  81  81   6  77   3
2  92  64  18  95  41  90  45   2
3  98  11  29  23  33  55  49  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives items with a relatively fair total value.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuation Items**: First, identify items that are highly valued by each agent. This ensures that agents receive items they value the most.

2. **Balance Total Valuation**: After allocating high-value items, balance out the remaining items to ensure that each agent has a fair share of total valuation.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items**: Assign the remaining items to agents considering their valuations and the current items they have.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- **Agent 0**: Highly values item 4 (99). It's reasonable to give them item 4.

- **Agent 1**: Highly values item 3 (81). It's reasonable to give them item 3. They also value item 4, but since it's given to Agent 0, we'll focus on another item.

- **Agent 2**: Highly values item 3 (95), but since item 3 is already given to Agent 1, we can give them item 5 (90).

- **Agent 3**: Highly values item 0 (98). It's reasonable to give them item 0.

With these initial allocations, we have:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [0]

Now, distribute the remaining items (1, 2, 6, 7) to balance valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Can take item 6 (64) which they value highly after item 4.
- **Agent 1**: Can take item 2 (46), which they value moderately.
- **Agent 2**: Can take item 1 (64), which they value highly.
- **Agent 3**: Can take item 7 (69), which they value moderately.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, and the overall distribution is balanced in terms of total valuation.
