Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  76  30  82   9  59  61  75
1  17  19  55  82  94  33  18  41
2  54  86  33  65  74  81  49  16
3  29  49   2  48  94  43  15  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to balance the value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and that all items are allocated. Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value for each item and allocate it to the respective agent.
2. Then, adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation is balanced.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 2 has the highest value (54).
- **Item 1:** Agent 2 has the highest value (86).
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 has the highest value (55).
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 has the highest value (82).
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 has the highest value (94).
- **Item 5:** Agent 2 has the highest value (81).
- **Item 6:** Agent 0 has the highest value (61).
- **Item 7:** Agent 3 has the highest value (99).

Based on this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: 2 items (3, 6)
- Agent 1: 2 items (2, 4)
- Agent 2: 3 items (0, 1, 5)
- Agent 3: 1 item (7)

Now, we present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 5],
    "3": [7]
}
```
