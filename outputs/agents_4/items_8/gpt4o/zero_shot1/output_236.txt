Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  54  36  59  33  30  90  26
1  94  31  33  55  66  24  35  15
2  69  35  30  23  44  36  97  74
3   4  93  50  60  30  78  42  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we can consider a method that attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We will aim for a balanced distribution, considering the sum of valuations for each possible allocation.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items with the highest values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that maximize their valuation after Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that maximize their valuation after Agents 0 and 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate remaining items that maximize their valuation.

Based on the table and to ensure fairness, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 should receive items where their valuation is comparatively high.
- Agent 1 should also receive items where their valuation is high, ensuring they have a similar total valuation.
- Agent 2 and Agent 3 should receive items that balance the total valuation among all agents.

Here's an allocation that distributes the items relatively fairly:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6] (Valuations: 72, 90)
- Agent 1: Items [4, 3] (Valuations: 66, 55)
- Agent 2: Items [7, 5] (Valuations: 74, 36)
- Agent 3: Items [1, 2] (Valuations: 93, 50)

This allocation gives each agent a balanced share considering their valuations, with each agent receiving two items.

### Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
