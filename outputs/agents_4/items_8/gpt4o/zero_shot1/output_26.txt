Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64   4  97  13  42  79  24  50
1  93  54  86  78  96  48  97  76
2  73  82   8  44  18  90  95   7
3  56  45  11  39  28  74  45  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0: [64, 4, 97, 13, 42, 79, 24, 50]  
Agent 1: [93, 54, 86, 78, 96, 48, 97, 76]  
Agent 2: [73, 82, 8, 44, 18, 90, 95, 7]  
Agent 3: [56, 45, 11, 39, 28, 74, 45, 60]  

A potential allocation strategy is to assign the items in such a way that the sum of valuations for each agent is maximized. Let's allocate the items:

1. Start by sorting each agent's valuations and identify the top two items for each agent.
2. Resolve any conflicts where multiple agents have high valuations for the same items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuations for items 2 (97) and 5 (79).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 (93) and 6 (97).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 6 (95) and 5 (90).
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 5 (74) and 7 (60).

Based on this, we must resolve conflicts:
- Item 5 is desired by three agents: 0, 2, and 3.
- Item 6 is desired by agents 1 and 2.

To resolve conflicts, we may assign item 5 to agent 2 (since it has the second highest value for agent 2 after item 6), item 6 to agent 1, and item 2 to agent 0. Agent 3 can receive items 3 and 7, which are their next highest values after the conflict resolution.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 6]
- Agent 2: [5, 1]
- Agent 3: [3, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 items, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
