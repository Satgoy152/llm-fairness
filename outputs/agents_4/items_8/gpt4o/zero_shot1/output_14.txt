Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  57  44  78  83  25  76  94
1  12  40  34  98  54  41  32  43
2  90  14  47  39  70  26  78  97
3  12  17  91  22  53  69  92  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can focus on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (94), Item 0 (84), Item 4 (83)
   - Assign Item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (98), Item 4 (54)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (97), Item 0 (90), Item 6 (78)
   - Item 7 is already allocated. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (92), Item 2 (91)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 4, 5, 6).

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Remaining high valuations: Item 0 (already allocated), Item 4 (83), Item 5 (25)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Remaining high valuations: Item 1 (40), Item 5 (41)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining high valuations: Item 6 (78), Item 1 (14)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3**:
   - Remaining item: Item 1
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.

The allocations are now complete. Each agent has been allocated items and all items have been assigned.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 1]
}
```
