Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  15  12  47  28  86  85  47
1  79  75  22   5  25  30  84  42
2   4  17  61  46  57  49  27  11
3  62  60   6  47  48  46  25  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [79 75 22  5 25 30 84 42]

 [62 60  6 47 48 46 25 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for a balanced distribution. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5, 6, and 3.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 6.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2, 4, and 3.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.

A possible fair allocation considering the above is:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 0 and 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 2 and 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign items 1, 3, and 7 to Agent 3.

This allocation provides each agent with a selection of items based on their preferences and attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
