Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  40   0  29  21  37   2   8
1  44  26  11  81  62  66  76  95
2  66  81  22  85  69  94  83   4
3  22  62  49  45  39  25  37  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we first consider each agent's valuations for the items. Our goal is to assign items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's examine the potential allocations:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High value items for Agent 0: Item 0 (79), Item 1 (40)
   - Assign Items: 0, 1

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High value items for Agent 1: Item 7 (95), Item 3 (81)
   - Assign Items: 3, 7

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High value items for Agent 2: Item 5 (94), Item 6 (83)
   - Assign Items: 5, 6

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Remaining items: Item 2, Item 4
   - Assign Items: 2, 4

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items. The allocation also seeks to maximize the value for each agent based on their preferences.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 4]
}
```
