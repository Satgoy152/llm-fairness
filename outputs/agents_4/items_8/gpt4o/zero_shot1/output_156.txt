Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  43   7  66  78  31  36  51
1  66   0  78  38  17  41  56  35
2  74  48  91  22  27  64   3  61
3  59  48  95  67  79  10  38  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here’s one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for items 4 (78) and 3 (66). However, since the goal is to distribute evenly and fairly, we will assign items 4, 3.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations are for items 2 (78) and 0 (66). Assign items 2, 0.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations are for items 2 (91) and 0 (74), but item 2 is already taken. Next, we choose items 5 (64) and 7 (61).

4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuations are for items 2 (95) and 4 (79), but these are taken. Next, take items 6 (38) and 1 (48).

Each agent gets two items, and all items are allocated. Here’s the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.
