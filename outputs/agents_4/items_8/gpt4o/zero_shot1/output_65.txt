Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87   1   1  26  28  44  53  31
1  54  12  59  31  49  53  71  11
2   3  47  43  85  83  43  15  74
3  78  42  19  90  94  90   1  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. This means giving each agent the items they value the most while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so we can allocate item 0 to them.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most, so we can allocate item 6 to them.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most, so we can allocate item 3 to them.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most, so we can allocate item 4 to them.

Now we need to distribute the remaining items: 1, 2, 5, and 7.

- Agent 0 also has a relatively high valuation for item 7, so we can allocate item 7 to them.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4, but it has already been allocated, so we allocate item 5 to them, which they value the next highest.
- Agent 2 values item 7, but it has already been allocated, so we allocate item 2 to them.
- Agent 3 values item 5, but it has already been allocated, so we allocate item 1 to them, which they value second highest.

Here's the allocation of items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [4, 1]
}
```
