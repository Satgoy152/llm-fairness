Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  76  54  67  29  28  19  14
1  46  46  88  68  89  58  68   0
2  43  92  76  10  50  82  89  47
3  14  20  22  94  51   4  16  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated.

One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm or auction-based method to allocate items based on the highest valuation. I'll use a simple approach to allocate items:

1. Go through each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (37).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (92).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (88).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (94).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (89).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (82).
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (89).
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most (82).

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 has item 0.
- Agent 1 has items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 has items 1, 5, and 6.
- Agent 3 has items 3 and 7.

All items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest value for each item while ensuring a fair distribution.
