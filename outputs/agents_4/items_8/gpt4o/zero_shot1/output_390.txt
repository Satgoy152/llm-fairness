Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  41  33  37   4  54   6  51
1  64  18  78  18  18  26  34  20
2  87  60  41  98  34  79  73  89
3  58  41  56   4  82  93  37  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent gets an approximately equal share of the total value of the items, while keeping the allocations integer. One approach is to use an algorithm that maximizes the minimum value each agent receives, akin to "envy-free" allocations or "max-min fair" allocations. 

Let's analyze the given table to make allocations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  41  33  37   4  54   6  51
1  64  18  78  18  18  26  34  20
2  87  60  41  98  34  79  73  89
3  58  41  56   4  82  93  37  11
```

Step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each agent's minimum value:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (98) and item 7 (89). We assign these to agent 2.
2. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (93) and item 4 (82). We assign these to agent 3.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (73) and item 1 (41). We assign these to agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (78). We assign item 2 to agent 1.
5. We have one item left, item 6. The remaining agents who have a lower total value should get it. Agent 1 has the lowest current allocation (only item 2), so we assign item 6 to agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives items that maximize their minimum value and all items are allocated.
