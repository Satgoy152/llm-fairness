Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  13  27  83  98  27  66  93
1  44  34  90  63  89  96  73  74
2  38  45  93  12  16  81  29  95
3   9  79  18   5  20  67  35   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed and that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:** We will allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that we maximize individual satisfaction for each item.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 47, which is the highest value. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it at 79, which is the highest value. Allocate to Agent 3.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 93, which is the highest value. Allocate to Agent 2.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 83, which is the highest value. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 98, which is the highest value. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 96, which is the highest value. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 73, which is the highest value. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it at 95, which is the highest value. Allocate to Agent 2.

3. **Final Allocation:** After this initial allocation, we ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items they value highly, maintaining fairness in terms of individual satisfaction. All items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
