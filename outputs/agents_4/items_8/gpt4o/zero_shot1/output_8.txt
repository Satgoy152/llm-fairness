Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  11  81  43   4  92  95  62
1  21  27  52  40   4  80  77  74
2  59  30  40   4  97  75  15  83
3  50  53   2  41  76  15  42  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 11 81 43  4 92 95 62]
 [21 27 52 40  4 80 77 74]

 [50 53  2 41 76 15 42 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 94).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value 53).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 81).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 41).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 97).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 92).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 95).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 83).

Now, we ensure that each agent gets items, and the total number of items allocated is 8:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: Items []
- Agent 2: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 3]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```
