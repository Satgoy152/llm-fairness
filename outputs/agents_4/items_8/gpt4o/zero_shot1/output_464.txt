Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90   8  40  48  85  74   3  26
1  18  90   3   4  45  27  75  56
2  73  98  75  65  54  25  94  83
3  94  92  44   2  55  74  13  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2, 6, and 7.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 3.

Based on these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 4
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 6, and 7
- **Agent 3**: Item 3 and 5

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 6, 7],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.
