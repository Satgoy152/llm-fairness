Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  26   2  14  69  22  73  21
1  28  69  81  96  98  33  68  91
2  30  90  25   1  18  39  13  10
3  85  87  48  76  43  85  53  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. Let's take a step-by-step approach to assign items to each agent.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 6 (73), 0 (72), 4 (69)
   - Assign item 6 (73) to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 (72) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 4 (98), 3 (96), 7 (91)
   - Assign item 4 (98) to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 3 (96) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (90), 5 (39), 2 (25)
   - Assign item 1 (90) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (87), 0 (85), 5 (85)
   - Assign item 5 (85) to Agent 3. 
   - Assign item 7 (31) to Agent 3.

Now, let's check if all items are assigned and each agent gets a fair allocation. The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Items [5, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items, maximizing their total valuations based on their preferences.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
