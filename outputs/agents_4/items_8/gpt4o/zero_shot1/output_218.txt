Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76   3  57   7  84  31  86  94
1  79  21  74  86  39  36   5  45
2  59  39  78  26  78  97   0  41
3  49  91  23  61  50  70  54  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76  3 57  7 84 31 86 94]
 [79 21 74 86 39 36  5 45]
 [59 39 78 26 78 97  0 41]
 [49 91 23 61 50 70 54 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is balanced in terms of the total value each agent receives. Here is a possible allocation that tries to achieve this balance:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 4, 6, and 7.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3, 2, and 0.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5 and 2.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.

We'll try to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 76).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 91).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 78).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 86).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 84).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 97).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 86).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (value 18).

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their highest preference for individual items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
