Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  82  85  40  37  23  17  91
1  64  68  51  53  49  11  71  90
2  28  58  47  19  79  33  90  25
3  89   8  94  82  89  47  18  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the four agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. We'll proceed by evaluating the valuations and assigning items to the agents in a way that balances their interests.

Let's start by finding some high-value items for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Items 7 (91) and 2 (85).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Items 7 (90) and 6 (71).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Items 6 (90) and 4 (79).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Items 2 (94) and 4 (89).

Now, assign items while trying to ensure fairness:

- Assign high-value items to the agents that value them most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
- Balance the distribution so that the total number of items allocated is 8.

Following this strategy, we could arrive at the following allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives items [2, 7].
- **Agent 1** receives items [1, 6].
- **Agent 2** receives items [4, 5].
- **Agent 3** receives items [0, 3].

This distribution allows each agent to receive at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
