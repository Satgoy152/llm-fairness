Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  40  40  55  67  85  15  51
1  18   6   7  47  77  91  97  28
2  94  36  72  90  90  29  48  53
3  16  45   9  80  29  86  74  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Let's consider the valuations given for each item by each agent and find an allocation that attempts to balance these values.

Here's a step-by-step approach to make the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value (94) is given by agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value (45) is given by agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value (72) is given by agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value (80) is given by agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value (90) is given by agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value (91) is given by agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value (97) is given by agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value (68) is given by agent 3.

After attempts to balance the allocation, here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
- **Agent 1**: [5, 6]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 2, 4]
- **Agent 3**: [1, 3, 7]

This allocation gives agent 1 a total valuation of 188, agent 2 a total valuation of 256, and agent 3 a total valuation of 193. Agent 0 receives no items. 

Now, let's provide this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 4],
    "3": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
