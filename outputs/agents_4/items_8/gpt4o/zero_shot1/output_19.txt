Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92   0  99  72  46  10  40  77
1  35  51  87  47  93  45  82  59
2  81  89  43  49  76  60  32  26
3  51  94  16  56  30  69  89   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. One approach is to try to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has a high value for items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 has a high value for item 4.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 1 and 5.
- Agent 3 has high values for items 3, 6, and 7.

Given these preferences, a reasonable allocation of items might be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6, 7

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 6, 7]
}
```
