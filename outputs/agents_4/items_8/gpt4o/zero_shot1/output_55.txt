Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  28  21  80  41  17  80  90
1  48  36  96  53  37  82  88  35
2  99  28  25  86  26  27  91  39
3   3  50  56  37  92  23  38  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 28 21 80 41 17 80 90]
 [48 36 96 53 37 82 88 35]
 [99 28 25 86 26 27 91 39]
 [ 3 50 56 37 92 23 38 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, given there are 8 items and 4 agents. We will try to allocate items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0: [28, 28, 21, 80, 41, 17, 80, 90]  
Agent 1: [48, 36, 96, 53, 37, 82, 88, 35]  
Agent 2: [99, 28, 25, 86, 26, 27, 91, 39]  
Agent 3: [3, 50, 56, 37, 92, 23, 38, 30]  

One potential fair allocation strategy is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Here is one such allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 7, which are their highest valued items.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 5, which are among their highest valued items.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 6, which are their highest valued items.
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 4, which are their highest valued items.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
