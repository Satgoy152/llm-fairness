Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  59  55  33  30  66  22  80
1  83  31  29  33  55  98   1  18
2  43  61  70  88  63   2  86  36
3  96  62  81  34  43  49  71  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 7 with a value of 80. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 5 with a value of 98. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 3 with a value of 88. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 0 with a value of 96. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - After the initial assignments, the remaining items are 1, 2, 4, and 6.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it provides a high value of 61.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3, as it provides a high value of 81.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it provides a value of 55.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it provides a value of 86.

This allocation tries to balance the distribution and ensure each agent receives items of high value to them.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3, 1, 6],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```
