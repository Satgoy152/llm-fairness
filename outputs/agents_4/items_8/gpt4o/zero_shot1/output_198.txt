Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  77  98  60  28  40  98   8
1  42  17  82  10  53  57  13  42
2  67  24  40  51  52  80  56  53
3  91  71  49  85  82  21  87   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 17 82 10 53 57 13 42]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider balancing the total value each agent receives. We can try to ensure each agent receives a fair share of the total value by examining the highest valuations and distributing items accordingly.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Valuations: [52, 77, 98, 60, 28, 40, 98, 8]
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are items 2 and 6 (both valued at 98).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: [42, 17, 82, 10, 53, 57, 13, 42]
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2 (valued at 82), but item 2 is already taken by Agent 0. Next highest value items are 5 (valued at 57) and 4 (valued at 53).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [67, 24, 40, 51, 52, 80, 56, 53]
   - Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 5 (valued at 80), but item 5 is already taken by Agent 1. Next highest value items are 0 (valued at 67) and 3 (valued at 51).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Valuations: [91, 71, 49, 85, 82, 21, 87, 8]
   - Highest value item for Agent 3 is item 0 (valued at 91) and 3 (valued at 85).

Here is a possible allocation that attempts to balance the overall value each agent receives:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of their higher valued items and tries to distribute the total value fairly among all agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
