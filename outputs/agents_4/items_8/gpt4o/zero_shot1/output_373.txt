Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  77  21  64  54  35  89  30
1  92  28  71  32  34  85  17  83
2   3   3  32  63  43  79   9  23
3  40  51  80   2  22  44   6  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value of items each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (89), Item 1 (77)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (92), Item 5 (85)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (63), Item 5 (79) [But Item 5 is already allocated]
   - Next highest: Item 4 (43)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (80), Item 7 (75)

Let's review the distribution: 

- Agent 0 has Items 6 and 1
- Agent 1 has Items 0 and 5
- Agent 2 has Items 3 and 4
- Agent 3 has Items 2 and 7

The allocation ensures each agent receives 2 items and maximizes the value for each agent as much as possible. Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```
