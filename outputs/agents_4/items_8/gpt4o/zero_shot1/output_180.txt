Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  26  49  10  61  30  53  47
1  50  84  28  89  14  73  16  18
2  14  49  22  37  92  25  72  47
3  78  15  43  28  59  23  69  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a method like the maximum sum allocation or envy-free allocation. Here, I'll aim to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their share, based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the data and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items:** 0 (94), 4 (61), 6 (53), 2 (49)
2. **Agent 1's highest valued items:** 3 (89), 1 (84), 5 (73), 0 (50)
3. **Agent 2's highest valued items:** 4 (92), 6 (72), 1 (49), 7 (47)
4. **Agent 3's highest valued items:** 0 (78), 6 (69), 7 (64), 2 (43)

I will attempt to allocate items considering the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring no agent gets the same item and all 8 items are allocated:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 4 (since 0 is highly valued by agent 0 and 4 is the highest available after 0)
- **Agent 1:** Items 3, 1 (3 is highly valued by agent 1 and 1 is the next highest available after 3)
- **Agent 2:** Items 6, 7 (6 is highly valued by agent 2 and 7 is the next highest available after 6)
- **Agent 3:** Items 5, 2 (5 is the next highly valued item for agent 3 after others have been allocated, followed by 2)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation is an attempt to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share and all items are allocated.
