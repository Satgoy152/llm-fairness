Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  68  93  77   5  68  81  79
1  99  99  38  82  61  99  65  21
2   7  95  62  41  21  20  12  11
3  66  40  58  85   2  53  51  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one potential way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with high valuations. Agent 0 values items 2, 3, 6, and 7 the highest. Let's assign item 2 to agent 0 since that's their highest value.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values items 0, 1, 5, and 3 the highest. Assign items 0 and 5 to agent 1, as they have the maximum value for these items compared to other agents.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest, so assign item 1 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values items 3, 7, 6, and 2 the highest. Assign item 3 and item 7 to agent 3 since those are some of their highest values compared to other agents.

After assigning these items, we need to allocate the remaining items 4 and 6:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 6 since it's among the higher-valued items for them.

- **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 as they still have a reasonable value for it and it's unallocated.

Now let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 5, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to only one agent, and all agents receive an integer number of items.
