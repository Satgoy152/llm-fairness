Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  35  52  80  19  41  77  58
1  80   8  59  83   3  27  89  36
2  37  52  71  69  80  60  16  31
3   4  61   3  97  53  64  21   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 with 80.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 6 with 89.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 with 80.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 with 97, but it is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next highest valuation is for item 5 with 64.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. Now, for remaining items [0, 1, 2, 7]:

   - **Agent 0**: 
     - Next highest unallocated valuation is for item 0 with 75.
     - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

   - **Agent 1**: 
     - Next highest unallocated valuation is for item 2 with 59.
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

   - **Agent 2**: 
     - Next highest unallocated valuation is for item 1 with 52.
     - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

   - **Agent 3**: 
     - The last remaining item is 7.
     - Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
