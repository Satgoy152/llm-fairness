Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  24  77  93  30  77  40  81
1  96  68  68  18  74  97  43  79
2  71  66  65  45  72  24  39  40
3  30  13   3  17  76  69  76  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We'll go through the process of determining the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Valuations: [86, 24, 77, 93, 30, 77, 40, 81]
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (93)
   - Second highest valuation is for item 0 (86)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Valuations: [96, 68, 68, 18, 74, 97, 43, 79]
   - Highest valuation is for item 5 (97)
   - Second highest valuation is for item 0 (96)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Valuations: [71, 66, 65, 45, 72, 24, 39, 40]
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (71)
   - Second highest valuation is for item 4 (72)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Valuations: [30, 13, 3, 17, 76, 69, 76, 38]
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (76)
   - Second highest valuation is for item 6 (76)

**Proposed Allocation:**
- Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each agent gets at least one item.

**Steps:**
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (93 value)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (97 value)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (76 value)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (71 value)

Now, we allocate the remaining items: 1, 2, 6, 7.

- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (66 value)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (77 value)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (76 value)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (79 value)

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.
