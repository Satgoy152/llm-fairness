Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  57  53  27  77  72  71  40
1  65  35  65  78  99  66   6   8
2  60  90  46  53  48  91  61   4
3  44  97   1  21  47  40   6  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations such that each agent receives items that maximize their overall satisfaction while distributing all items. One way to do this is to ensure that each agent gets items with high valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is relatively balanced and each agent gets at least one item.

Based on the given values:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 57 + 57 + 53 + 27 + 77 + 72 + 71 + 40 = 454
- Agent 1's total valuation: 65 + 35 + 65 + 78 + 99 + 66 + 6 + 8 = 422
- Agent 2's total valuation: 60 + 90 + 46 + 53 + 48 + 91 + 61 + 4 = 453
- Agent 3's total valuation: 44 + 97 + 1 + 21 + 47 + 40 + 6 + 81 = 337

To achieve a fair allocation, we can proceed by assigning items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction per item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's how the allocation can be performed:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 4 and 5, as they have high valuations from Agent 0 (values 77 and 72).
- Agent 1: Allocate items 3 and 0, as they have high valuations from Agent 1 (values 78 and 65).
- Agent 2: Allocate items 1 and 6, as they have high valuations from Agent 2 (values 90 and 61).
- Agent 3: Allocate items 7 and 2, as they have high valuations from Agent 3 (values 81 and 1).

Now, let's format the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their individual valuations.
