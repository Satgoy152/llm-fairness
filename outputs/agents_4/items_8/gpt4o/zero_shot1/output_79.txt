Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85   4  15  55  39  18  36   6
1   3   4  45  99  27  80  75  65
2  19  53  50  68  39  72  67  19
3  89  83  63  57  20  81  56  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Given there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent can receive either 2 items or 1 item, as long as the total remains 8. We aim to maximize the total value each agent receives by selecting items they value the most, considering the constraint that only integer allocations per agent are possible.

Let's review the agents' valuations and consider possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0** values items as follows: [85, 4, 15, 55, 39, 18, 36, 6]
2. **Agent 1** values items as follows: [3, 4, 45, 99, 27, 80, 75, 65]
3. **Agent 2** values items as follows: [19, 53, 50, 68, 39, 72, 67, 19]
4. **Agent 3** values items as follows: [89, 83, 63, 57, 20, 81, 56, 63]

For a fair allocation, we need to balance maximizing each agent's value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. One possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Select items where Agent 0 has relatively high valuations.
- **Agent 1**: Select items where Agent 1 has the highest valuations.
- **Agent 2**: Select items where Agent 2 has relatively high valuations.
- **Agent 3**: Select items where Agent 3 has the highest valuations.

Based on this approach, here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (85), Item 4 (39)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 3 (99), Item 5 (80)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 2 (50), Item 6 (67)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 1 (83), Item 7 (63)

This allocation ensures each agent gets 2 items, maximizing their value based on their preferences.

Now, presenting this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
