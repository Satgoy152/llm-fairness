Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20   4  61   7  81   6  78  21
1  30  33  88  73  38  43  76  82
2  57  45  95  52  67  18  97  47
3  25   8  32  33  89  69  45  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a method like round-robin or a greedy algorithm that assigns items in a way that balances the total value among agents.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents by selecting the highest available valuation for each agent sequentially until all items are allocated.

Let's start with a greedy allocation approach:

1. Sort each item by its highest valuation and allocate it to the respective agent. This helps ensure that each item goes to the agent who values it the most.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

- Item 2 has the highest value 95 for agent 2.
- Item 4 has the highest value 89 for agent 3.
- Item 6 has the highest value 97 for agent 2.
- Item 1 has the highest value 45 for agent 2.
- Item 7 has the highest value 82 for agent 1.
- Item 0 has the highest value 57 for agent 2.
- Item 5 has the highest value 69 for agent 3.
- Item 3 has the highest value 73 for agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [2, 6, 1, 0],
    "3": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, considering their valuations for each item.
