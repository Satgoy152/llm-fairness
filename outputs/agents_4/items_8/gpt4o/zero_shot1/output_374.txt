Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  55  16  57   9  52  71  96
1  99  79  55  42   8  27  35  70
2  25   0  27  89  42  73  49  74
3  12  36  66  14  32  91  36  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 7.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3, 5, and 7.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 5 and 2.

A fair allocation might look like this:

1. Assign items based on the highest unique valuations for each agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible solution:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 7.
- Agent 1: Assign items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2: Assign items 3 and 5.
- Agent 3: Assign items 4 and 6.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution tries to satisfy the agents' highest preferences as much as possible.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
