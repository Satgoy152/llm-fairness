Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  78  47  40   1  77  62  59
1  11  62  39  57   1  65  32  21
2  43  30  61  78  33  69   5  95
3   5  96  49  45  98  13  65  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation reflects their valuations while aiming to distribute the total value as evenly as possible. One common method to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's see how this allocation would look based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 94 (highest).
   - Assign to Agent 0.

2. Item 1: 
   - Agent 3 values it at 96 (highest).
   - Assign to Agent 3.

3. Item 2: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 61 (highest).
   - Assign to Agent 2.

4. Item 3: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 78 (highest).
   - Assign to Agent 2.

5. Item 4: 
   - Agent 3 values it at 98 (highest).
   - Assign to Agent 3.

6. Item 5: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 69 (highest).
   - Assign to Agent 2.

7. Item 6: 
   - Agent 3 values it at 65 (highest).
   - Assign to Agent 3.

8. Item 7: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 95 (highest).
   - Assign to Agent 2.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3, 5, 7],
    "3": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
