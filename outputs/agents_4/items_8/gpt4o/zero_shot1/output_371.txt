Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  21  61  66  71  72  53   1
1  51  78  56  23  99  58  96  86
2  84  22  20  94  85  40   5  60
3  35  12  93  85  13  57  22   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 (72) the highest.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 (99) the highest.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 (94) the highest.
   - Agent 3 values item 2 (93) the highest.

   Current allocation:
   - Agent 0: [5]
   - Agent 1: [4]
   - Agent 2: [3]
   - Agent 3: [2]

2. **Assign the remaining items based on the highest remaining values:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 6, 7
   - Agent 0 values item 4 (71) the second highest (already taken), so consider item 0 (21) next.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 (78) the second highest.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 (84) the highest.
   - Agent 3 values item 0 (35) the second highest (but it's already higher for agent 2).

   Assign based on availability:
   - Agent 2 gets item 0 (84).
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 (78).
   - Remaining items: 6, 7

3. **Assign the last two items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 (53) next.
   - Agent 3 values item 7 (1).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [5, 6]
- Agent 1: [4, 1]
- Agent 2: [3, 0]
- Agent 3: [2, 7]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the items are distributed based on the agents' valuations.
