Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  86  48  21  31   1  39  29
1   9  59  25  68  73  62  88   4
2  66  51  13  48  33  91  56  27
3  56  53  78  65  59  20   9  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item whenever possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Identify Valuations**: We have the valuation table given as:

   | Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
   |------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
   | 0          | 34 | 86 | 48 | 21 | 31 |  1 | 39 | 29 |
   | 1          |  9 | 59 | 25 | 68 | 73 | 62 | 88 |  4 |
   | 2          | 66 | 51 | 13 | 48 | 33 | 91 | 56 | 27 |
   | 3          | 56 | 53 | 78 | 65 | 59 | 20 |  9 | 85 |

2. **Allocate Items**: We will assign items to agents based on maximizing their values, ensuring each agent receives items and all items are allocated.

3. **Assignment Strategy**: We'll start by assigning each agent their highest valued item, then proceed to allocate remaining items to ensure all agents receive items, if possible.

   - Agent 0's highest value item is 1 (value 86).
   - Agent 1's highest value item is 6 (value 88).
   - Agent 2's highest value item is 5 (value 91).
   - Agent 3's highest value item is 7 (value 85).

   After assigning these, we have:

   - Agent 0 receives item 1.
   - Agent 1 receives item 6.
   - Agent 2 receives item 5.
   - Agent 3 receives item 7.

   Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 4.

4. **Distribute Remaining Items**:

   - Of the remaining items, assign based on the next highest preferences while ensuring no agent is left without an item.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 66).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value 78).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 68).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 31).

5. **Final Allocation**:

   The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that:
- All items are distributed.
- Each agent's highest valued items have been prioritized.
- Each agent receives at least one item.
