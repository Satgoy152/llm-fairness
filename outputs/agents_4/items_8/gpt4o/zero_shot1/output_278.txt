Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3   1  68  39  77  42  73   0
1   1  42   5  42  83  41  76  17
2  39  65  14  50  25  84  13  67
3  26  57   8  98  74  87  93   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives, considering they each need to get an integer number of items. We will try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated.

First, let's calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 3 + 1 + 68 + 39 + 77 + 42 + 73 + 0 = 303
- Agent 1: 1 + 42 + 5 + 42 + 83 + 41 + 76 + 17 = 307
- Agent 2: 39 + 65 + 14 + 50 + 25 + 84 + 13 + 67 = 357
- Agent 3: 26 + 57 + 8 + 98 + 74 + 87 + 93 + 2 = 445

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. We assign the highest value items to the agents who value them the most.
2. We consider the overall balance and ensure that each agent receives approximately equal value.

Allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 39) - highest value for item 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 65) - highest value for item 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 68) - highest value for item 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 98) - highest value for item 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 83) - highest value for item 4.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (value 87) - second highest value for item 5, but balances allocation better.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 73) - highest value for item 6.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 17) - balances allocation.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide a fair distribution of total value across all agents while ensuring each agent receives the items they value highly.
