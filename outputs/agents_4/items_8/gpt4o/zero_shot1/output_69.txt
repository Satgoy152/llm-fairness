Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  22  20  72  38  51  48  24
1  61  31  63  66  82  94  47  77
2  58  61   8  86  36  69  77  16
3  27  64  39  46  73  35  76  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations and attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 (94), which is the highest single valuation in the table. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (86). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 3 (72), but since it's already allocated, we look for the next best available. Item 4 (38) is relatively high for Agent 0. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 6 (76) and 7 (72). Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. Now, consider the remaining unallocated items (0, 1, 2, 7).

   - For item 0, Agent 1 values it the most (61). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - For item 1, Agent 3 values it the most (64). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
   - For item 2, Agent 1 values it the most (63). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - For item 7, Agent 1 values it the most (77). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

After these allocations, all items are distributed fairly based on the highest valuations, ensuring no item is left unallocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with all items allocated.
