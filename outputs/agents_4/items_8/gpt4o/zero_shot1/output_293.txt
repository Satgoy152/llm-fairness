Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  92   8  40  10   3  84  14
1  12  58  38  58  74   4   4  99
2  92  60  46  18  20  12  29  43
3  22  96  52  45  35  46   0   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and ideally, items are distributed in a way that reflects the agents' valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify each agent's highest-valued items**: By examining the table, we can determine which items each agent values the most.

2. **Ensure all items are allocated**: We need to ensure that all items are allocated to maximize the total valuation.

3. **Balance allocations**: Each agent should ideally receive 2 items since there are 8 items and 4 agents, but we must ensure that all items are assigned.

Let's consider the following allocations based on the highest total valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 1 (92) and 6 (84).
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 7 (99) and 4 (74).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 0 (92) and 2 (46).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 3 (45) and 5 (46).

These allocations try to balance the total valuations each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Here's the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent is receiving items and the total number of items allocated is 8.
