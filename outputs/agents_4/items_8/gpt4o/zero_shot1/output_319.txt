Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31   8  55  53  63  22  66  58
1  67  75  48  65  28  48  70   5
2  44  17  85  27  90   5  68  27
3  90  93  80  57  44  97  77  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we should aim to distribute them based on the valuation each agent places on the items, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (66), Item 4 (63), Item 7 (58), Item 3 (53), Item 2 (55).
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (75), Item 6 (70), Item 3 (65).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (90), Item 2 (85), Item 6 (68).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (93), Item 0 (90), Item 5 (97).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3 (highest value).

Now, each agent has been allocated one item. We need to allocate the remaining 4 items (Items 0, 2, 3, 7).

Continuing with the allocations:

5. **Agent 3**:
   - Already allocated Item 5.
   - Next highest: Item 0 (90).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 3.

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Already allocated Item 4.
   - Next highest: Item 2 (85).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

7. **Agent 0**:
   - Already allocated Item 6.
   - Next highest: Item 7 (58).
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0.

8. **Agent 1**:
   - Already allocated Item 1.
   - Next highest: Item 3 (65).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [5, 0]
}
```
