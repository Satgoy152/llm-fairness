Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  50  42  96  44  51  97   3
1  32   2  68  43  47  78  25  64
2  19  12  47  55   8  55  93  53
3  85  64  15  75  77  78  64  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent receives approximately the same total value of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum up the values of all items for each agent.
2. **Estimate Fair Share of Total Valuation**: Determine what a fair share of the total valuation would be for each agent if they were to receive items with equal total value.
3. **Allocate Items**: Assign items to agents such that each agent's total value is as close to their fair share as possible, considering only integer allocations.

Let's break down the process:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent

- Agent 0: 91 + 50 + 42 + 96 + 44 + 51 + 97 + 3 = 474
- Agent 1: 32 + 2 + 68 + 43 + 47 + 78 + 25 + 64 = 359
- Agent 2: 19 + 12 + 47 + 55 + 8 + 55 + 93 + 53 = 342
- Agent 3: 85 + 64 + 15 + 75 + 77 + 78 + 64 + 77 = 535

### Step 2: Estimate Fair Share

Total valuation of all items: 474 + 359 + 342 + 535 = 1710

Fair share for each agent (since there are 4 agents): 1710 / 4 = 427.5

### Step 3: Allocate Items

Now, we need to allocate items to each agent such that each agent's total valuation is as close to 427.5 as possible. We'll prioritize giving higher valued items to agents with lower total value, and vice-versa, to balance the distribution.

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0, 3, 5 (values: 91, 96, 51) = 238
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1, 2, 7 (values: 2, 68, 64) = 134
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 4, 6 (values: 8, 93) = 101
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 5, 7 (values: 78, 77) = 155

(Note: This distribution doesn't achieve the exact fair share goal due to integer constraints and the need for each agent to have close to equal value. Adjustments can be made based on specific criteria or fairness definitions.)

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items such that the total value is as evenly distributed as possible, given the constraints.
