Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  23  30  20  93  56  77  19
1  59  42  29  91  55  60  98  99
2  38  44  13   7  81  81  99  16
3  78  58  89  51  22  54  82  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. We will consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: 4, 0
   - Total value: 93 + 3 = 96

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items: 7, 3
   - Total value: 99 + 91 = 190

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item: 6
   - Total value: 99

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items: 2, 1, 5
   - Total value: 89 + 58 + 54 = 201

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, with the total number of items allocated being 8. The allocation aims to balance the total values each agent receives, based on the initial given valuations.

The allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 1, 5]
}
```
