Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  16  76   8  59  31  85  11
1  91  54  62  60  17  45  64  93
2  26  63  71  34  83  65  73  94
3  50  91  77  38  68  51  74  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value across all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the items and assign them accordingly.

Here's the allocation based on the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (value 91)
- Item 1: Agent 3 (value 91)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (value 76)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (value 60)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (value 83)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (value 65)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (value 85)
- Item 7: Agent 2 (value 94)

Now, let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 7],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and all items are distributed among the agents.
