Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  32  55  23  90  41  17  76
1  46  86  47  82  59  87  10  36
2  88  14  48   4  50   9  88   8
3  11  35  91  22  49  55  21  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize the total value across all agents or ensure that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, depending on fairness criteria such as envy-freeness or efficiency.

Let's start by examining each agent's highest-valued items:

- **Agent 0** values item 4 (90) and item 0 (58) highly.
- **Agent 1** values item 5 (87) and item 1 (86) highly.
- **Agent 2** values item 0 (88) and item 6 (88) highly.
- **Agent 3** values item 2 (91) and item 7 (86) highly.

Given that, we can try to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's top preferences while ensuring each item is only allocated once. Let's attempt to distribute items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items 4 and 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 5 and 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 6 and 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items 7 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and their preferences are considered. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation sums up to a total of 8 items, with each item being uniquely assigned to an agent, respecting each agent's highest preferences.
