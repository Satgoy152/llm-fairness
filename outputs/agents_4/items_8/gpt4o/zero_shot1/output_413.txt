Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  24  35  18  15  79  38  99
1   9  68  86  25  96  62  84  17
2  44  72  74  91  94  28  44  21
3  42  44  46  15  13  24  39  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items allocated. The goal is to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

Here's one possible approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (99), Item 0 (92), Item 5 (79)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (96), Item 2 (86), Item 1 (68)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (94), Item 3 (91), Item 1 (72)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (46), Item 1 (44), Item 0 (42)

Next, let's attempt to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 7 (highest value), Item 0 (second highest value)
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (highest value), Item 2 (second highest value)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (highest value), Item 1 (second highest value)
- **Agent 3**: Item 5 (highest among remaining), Item 6 (next highest among remaining)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items. The allocation based on maximizing each agent's valuation could look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This distribution attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.
