Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  30  72  56  14  74   4   2
1  21  33  46  52  59  52   1  70
2  60  20  20  86  62  95  82  39
3  28  98  41  77  95  15  83  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. To achieve this, we can use a simple heuristic approach where we consider each agent's highest valued items and attempt to distribute them fairly.

Here's a step-by-step outline of a possible allocation strategy:

1. Consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated is 8.

Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 5 (74).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 7 (70).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 5 (95), but since item 5 is already allocated, consider the next highest value, which is item 3 (86).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 1 (98).

Now, let's allocate some of the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 2 (72) as their next highest valued item after item 5.
- Agent 1 can take item 4 (59) as their next highest valued item after item 7.
- Agent 2 can take item 6 (82) as their next highest valued item after item 3.
- Agent 3 can take item 0 (28) as their next highest valued item after item 1.

Here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are distributed.
