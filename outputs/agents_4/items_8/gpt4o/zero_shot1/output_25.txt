Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  61  30  36   0  74  11  50
1  70  19  91  26  24  20  55   3
2   5  18  86  73  35  29  59  61
3  78  17  11  85  40  56  14  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 5.  
   - Total value: 64 (item 0) + 74 (item 5) = 138

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2 and 6.
   - Total value: 91 (item 2) + 55 (item 6) = 146

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items 3 and 7.
   - Total value: 73 (item 3) + 61 (item 7) = 134

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items 1 and 4.
   - Total value: 17 (item 1) + 40 (item 4) = 57

This allocation attempts to balance out the values each agent receives, given their individual valuations of the items. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
