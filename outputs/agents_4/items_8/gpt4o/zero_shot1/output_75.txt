Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  11  34  95   2  84   0   6
1  72  48  99  55  55  99  32  64
2  12  39  23  66  18  38  74  60
3  97  65  23  59  75  82  48   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items based on their preferences, while also ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values item 3 with a valuation of 95. We can assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 2 and item 5, both with a valuation of 99. We can assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 6 with a valuation of 74. We can assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 0 with a valuation of 97. We can assign item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 4, 5, 7) while considering the remaining valuations:

5. **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as itâ€™s the next highest valued unallocated item by Agent 1 (valuation 99).
6. **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as it has a valuation of 75 for Agent 3.
7. **Agent 0**: Assign item 7 to Agent 0, as it has a valuation of 6, which is relatively higher for Agent 0 compared to other unallocated items.
8. **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it has a valuation of 39, which is the highest remaining unallocated item for Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```
