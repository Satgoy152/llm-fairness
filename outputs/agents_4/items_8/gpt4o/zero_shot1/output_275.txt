Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  67  35  90  12  10  69   1
1  63  46  61   8  97  91  71  64
2  61  22  74  34  48  89  34  52
3  45  80  51  30   1  63  27  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a comparable share of value based on their own valuations. We should also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Determine how much each agent values all items collectively to get a sense of their preferences.
2. **Prioritize High-Value Items**: Allocate items one by one to the agent that values them the most, ensuring each agent receives items until all items are allocated.
3. **Check Fairness**: Ensure that the allocation is reasonably fair, meaning no agent feels substantially disadvantaged compared to others.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 5 + 67 + 35 + 90 + 12 + 10 + 69 + 1 = 289
- Agent 1: 63 + 46 + 61 + 8 + 97 + 91 + 71 + 64 = 501
- Agent 2: 61 + 22 + 74 + 34 + 48 + 89 + 34 + 52 = 414
- Agent 3: 45 + 80 + 51 + 30 + 1 + 63 + 27 + 81 = 378

Now, allocate items based on who values them the most:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most (63). Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most (80). Allocate to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most (74). Allocate to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (90). Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (97). Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most (89). Allocate to Agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most (71). Allocate to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most (81). Allocate to Agent 3.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated, and each agent has a reasonable share:

- Agent 0: [3] - Total value = 90
- Agent 1: [0, 4, 6] - Total value = 63 + 97 + 71 = 231
- Agent 2: [2, 5] - Total value = 74 + 89 = 163
- Agent 3: [1, 7] - Total value = 80 + 81 = 161

This allocation ensures that every agent gets items and tries to respect their preferences as much as possible. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
