Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  24  90  39  67  51   6  36
1  14  25  49  54  68  26  20  78
2  70  98  88  54  24  70  27   1
3  90  41  40   5   2  27  58   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. One possible approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent is considered for receiving items. Here’s a fair allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value for each item across all agents and allocate that item to the respective agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's go through each item:

- **Item 0:**
  - Agent 3 values it highest at 90.
- **Item 1:**
  - Agent 2 values it highest at 98.
- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 0 values it highest at 90.
- **Item 3:**
  - Agent 1 values it highest at 54.
- **Item 4:**
  - Agent 1 values it highest at 68.
- **Item 5:**
  - Agent 2 values it highest at 70.
- **Item 6:**
  - Agent 3 values it highest at 58.
- **Item 7:**
  - Agent 1 values it highest at 78.

With this allocation, Agent 0 receives 1 item, Agent 1 receives 3 items, Agent 2 receives 2 items, and Agent 3 receives 2 items. Here’s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
