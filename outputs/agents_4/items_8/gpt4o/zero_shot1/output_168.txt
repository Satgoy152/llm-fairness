Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  33  33  89   8  72  40  67
1  90  10  25  22  49  71  56  84
2  35   4  31  26   7  88  83  28
3  78  78  52   0  22  14  87  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items that Agent 0 values highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that Agent 1 values highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items that Agent 2 values highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items that Agent 3 values highly.

Let's consider the value each agent has for each item and allocate accordingly:

- Start by selecting the highest available valued item for each agent, ensuring no item is assigned twice.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 (Value = 89)
   - Item 5 (Value = 72)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 0 (Value = 90)
   - Item 7 (Value = 84)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 6 (Value = 83)
   - Item 5 is already taken, so next highly valued available:
   - Item 2 (Value = 31)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 1 (Value = 78)
   - Item 4 (Value = 22)

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly and all items are distributed fairly among the agents, with each agent receiving a total of two items.
