Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  25  71   2  14  78  88  59
1  86  81   9  49   8  32  52  98
2  71  55  14   5  10  19  96  83
3   7  25  41  10  38  69  15   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A potential approach is to assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each item is allocated once.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest value items: 6 (value 88) and 5 (value 78)
   
2. Agent 1: 
   - Highest value items: 7 (value 98) and 0 (value 86)
   
3. Agent 2: 
   - Highest value items: 6 (value 96) and 7 (value 83)
   
4. Agent 3: 
   - Highest value items: 5 (value 69) and 4 (value 38)

After evaluating the values and ensuring a fair allocation, here is the final distribution:

- Agent 0: [6, 5]
- Agent 1: [7, 0]
- Agent 2: [2, 1]
- Agent 3: [4, 3]

Now, let's present it in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [7, 0],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [4, 3]
}
```
