Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  17  65  30  96  66  85  41
1  67  33  56   5  29  83   5  72
2  33  99  17  76  52  46  60  58
3  59  53  27  11  59  38  81  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while distributing exactly 8 items among the 4 agents. Let's go through a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (96)
   - Next highest valued item: Item 6 (85)
   - Allocate items 4 and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (83)
   - Next highest valued item: Item 0 (67)
   - Allocate items 5 and 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (99)
   - Next highest valued item: Item 3 (76)
   - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 6 (81) [already allocated, choose next]
   - Next highest valued item: Item 7 (81)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Now we have allocated 7 items, leaving one more item to allocate. The remaining unallocated items are 2. The next step is to assign the last unallocated item in a way that maintains a balance.

5. **Assign the remaining item**:
   - Item 2 is unallocated and can be assigned to the agent who values it the most among those who can receive more items.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 65.
   - Agent 3 can receive it without exceeding the item limit.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.
