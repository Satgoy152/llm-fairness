Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  36  10  89   6  93  17  25
1   5  69  61  14  44  92  39  46
2  65  32  68  36  44  69   5  21
3  25  85  59  36   0  53  10  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 69 61 14 44 92 39 46]

 [25 85 59 36  0 53 10 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated in total. We will aim to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is balanced, considering their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [47, 36, 10, 89, 6, 93, 17, 25]
- Agent 1: [5, 69, 61, 14, 44, 92, 39, 46]
- Agent 2: [65, 32, 68, 36, 44, 69, 5, 21]
- Agent 3: [25, 85, 59, 36, 0, 53, 10, 46]

A possible fair allocation strategy is to give each agent 2 items (since there are 8 items and 4 agents):

1. Allocate items based on highest preference for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets exactly 2 items.

Let's make a balanced allocation:

- Agent 0: Items with highest values are 5 (93) and 3 (89).
- Agent 1: Items with highest values are 5 (92) and 1 (69).
- Agent 2: Items with highest values are 2 (68) and 5 (69).
- Agent 3: Items with highest values are 1 (85) and 7 (46).

Adjusting to avoid overlaps:

- Agent 0: [5, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 1]
- Agent 2: [0, 6]
- Agent 3: [4, 7]

These allocations ensure each agent has 2 items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Now let's output the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
