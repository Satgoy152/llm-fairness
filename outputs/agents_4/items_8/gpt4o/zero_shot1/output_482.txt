Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  68  60  69  84  93  63  41
1  13  55  45   1  46  62  53  86
2  95  94  64  36  62  22  48  79
3   9  95  29  97   7  50  79  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the preferences of the agents and attempts to maximize their total valuation. A common approach is to use a greedy allocation strategy, where items are allocated to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total allocations remain fair.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 7, 68, 60, 69, 84, 93, 63, 41
Agent 1: 13, 55, 45, 1, 46, 62, 53, 86
Agent 2: 95, 94, 64, 36, 62, 22, 48, 79
Agent 3: 9, 95, 29, 97, 7, 50, 79, 97
```

Here is a straightforward allocation strategy:

1. Look for the highest value for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate that item to the agent with the highest valuation for it.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items equals 8.

Following this strategy, here is a possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (value 95)
- Item 1: Agent 2 (value 94)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (value 60)
- Item 3: Agent 3 (value 97)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (value 84)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (value 93)
- Item 6: Agent 3 (value 79)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (value 86)

Checking the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
