Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  91  72  55  25  36  41  59
1  67   1  40  99  90  37  17   9
2  96  10  73  98  94  93  57  42
3   0  59  48  36  71  79  11  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while also ensuring every agent gets at least one item. Let's go through a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are items 1 (91) and 2 (72).
   - To balance the distribution, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 3 (99).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are items 0 (96) and 3 (98), but item 3 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 3 are items 5 (79) and 7 (78).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, to ensure all items are allocated and each agent has a reasonable allocation, distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (72) is still high for Agent 0, so allocate item 2.
- Agent 1: Item 4 (90) is also high for Agent 1, allocate item 4.
- Agent 2: Allocate item 6 (57) to Agent 2, as it is a decent value.
- Agent 3: Allocate item 7 (78) to Agent 3, as it's one of the high-value items for them.

Now, each agent has two items, and all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
