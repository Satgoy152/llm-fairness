Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  53  97  44  99   2  43  56
1   5  23  47  58  85  23  39  17
2  69  37  64  32   5  92  43  37
3  66  38  11  47  37   5  50  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method aiming to maximize the total valuations or ensure each agent gets at least one item they value highly. We'll try to distribute the items evenly and fairly based on their preferences.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Highest Valuation Per Agent:**
   - Find the items with the highest valuation for each agent.
   - Assign those items first, ensuring no overlap.

2. **Assign Remaining Items:**
   - Once each agent has received at least one item, assign the remaining items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (99)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (85), but it's assigned to Agent 0.
   - Next highest value item: Item 3 (58)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (92)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value item: Item 7 (80)
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 3.

### Distribute Remaining Items:

- Remaining items: 0, 1, 2, 6

5. **Agent 0:**
   - Remaining highest value item: Item 2 (97)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1:**
   - Remaining highest value item: Item 6 (39)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2:**
   - Remaining highest value item: Item 0 (69)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3:**
   - Remaining item: Item 1 (38)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [7, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
