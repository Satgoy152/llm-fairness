Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  90  56  97  24  33  22  37
1  49  54  84  55  97  21  16  72
2  95  86  19  43  58  47  17  97
3  15  63  42  37   8  71  96  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 90 56 97 24 33 22 37]
 [49 54 84 55 97 21 16 72]

 [15 63 42 37  8 71 96 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated and the distribution is fair. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate accordingly:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most.
3. Agent 2 values items 0 and 7 highly.
4. Agent 3 values items 6 and 7 highly.

Given these observations, we aim for a fair distribution where each agent gets a roughly equal sum of valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3 (valuations: 94, 97)
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 2 (valuations: 97, 84)
- Agent 2 gets items 7 and 5 (valuations: 97, 47)
- Agent 3 gets items 6 and 1 (valuations: 96, 63)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the required json format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [6, 1]
}
```
