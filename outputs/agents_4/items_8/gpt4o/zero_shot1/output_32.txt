Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  19  14  99  83  76  10  15
1  60  20   5  78  53  44  94   1
2  30  85  39  29  89  82   9  74
3  88  29  41  58  16   3  52  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: First, allocate items to agents based on the highest value each agent places on the items.
2. **Ensure Fair Distribution**: Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and try to distribute the items such that the total valuations are as balanced as possible.

Let's go through the items and allocate them based on these principles:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 with 99.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 6 with 94.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 with 89.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 with 88.

With these allocations:

- Item 3 goes to Agent 0.
- Item 6 goes to Agent 1.
- Item 4 goes to Agent 2.
- Item 0 goes to Agent 3.

Now, for the remaining items, we will allocate based on the next highest valuations:

- Item 1 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 with 85.
- Item 5 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 with 82.
- Item 7 has the highest valuation from Agent 3 with 86.
- Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 3 with 41.

With these allocations:

- Item 1 goes to Agent 2.
- Item 5 goes to Agent 2.
- Item 7 goes to Agent 3.
- Item 2 goes to Agent 3.

Now, let's summarize these allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 1, 5],
    "3": [0, 7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the items are distributed to maximize the total value for each agent based on their valuations.
