Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  73  52  52  33  80  75  28
1  47  56  69  55   7  28   7   6
2   9  84  81  83  29  10  51  75
3  10  16  65  38  63  32  84  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent places on the items and ensure that each agent receives a fair share of items. We have 4 agents and 8 items, so ideally, each agent would get 2 items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   Agent 0 values items 5 and 6 highly (values 80 and 75 respectively). Allocating these items to Agent 0 seems fair.

2. **Agent 1**:  
   Agent 1 values item 2 the most (value 69) and item 3 second (value 55). Allocating these items to Agent 1 is a good choice.

3. **Agent 2**:  
   Agent 2 values item 1 the most (value 84) and item 3 second (value 83). However, since item 3 is already allocated, the next highest is item 7 (value 75). Allocating items 1 and 7 to Agent 2 works well.

4. **Agent 3**:  
   With the remaining items, Agent 3 values item 6 highly (value 84), but it is already allocated. The next highest values are items 4 (value 63) and 0 (value 10). Allocating these items to Agent 3 is fair.

Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the allocation is based on the highest valuations they have for the available items.
