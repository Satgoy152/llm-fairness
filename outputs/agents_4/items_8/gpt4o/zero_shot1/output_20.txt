Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  40  96  22   9  65  62   3
1  59  18  97  35  97  72  44  56
2  38  83  16  95  10  92  20   9
3   2  85  62  82  62   0  95  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for all items. Our goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach for allocating the items:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - There are 8 items and 4 agents, so ideally, each agent should receive 2 items.
   - We should aim to allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations to maximize overall satisfaction.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item that hasn't been taken.
   - Continue assigning the next highest-valued items that remain unallocated until all items are distributed.

3. **Allocation Process**:
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 2 (96) and 0 (82).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for items 2 (97) and 4 (97). Item 2 is already taken, so next highest is item 5 (72).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are for items 3 (95) and 5 (92). Item 5 is already taken, so next highest is item 1 (83).
   - Agent 3: Highest values are for items 6 (95) and 7 (88).

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 2 and 0.
   - Agent 1: Items 4 and 5.
   - Agent 2: Items 3 and 1.
   - Agent 3: Items 6 and 7.

Following this approach, we ensure a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```
