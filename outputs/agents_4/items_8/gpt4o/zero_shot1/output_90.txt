Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  15  62  91  68  75  38  19
1   2  41  39   8  96  45  59  25
2  41  74  42  34  54  19  15  50
3  89  11  12  97  48  40  96   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79 15 62 91 68 75 38 19]
 [ 2 41 39  8 96 45 59 25]
 [41 74 42 34 54 19 15 50]
 [89 11 12 97 48 40 96  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction while distributing all 8 items.

Let's analyze the preferences:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (79), 3 (91), and 5 (75).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (96).
- **Agent 2** has higher valuations for items 1 (74) and 2 (42).
- **Agent 3** highly values items 0 (89), 3 (97), and 6 (96).

A potential fair allocation could consider these high valuations and try to distribute items such that each agent receives items corresponding to their highest preferences, ensuring no item is over-claimed.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 3 (91) and 5 (75) - total valuation: 166
2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 (96) - total valuation: 96
3. **Agent 2**: Items 1 (74) and 2 (42) - total valuation: 116
4. **Agent 3**: Items 0 (89), 6 (96), and 7 (8) - total valuation: 193

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuations, and all 8 items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0, 6, 7]
}
```
