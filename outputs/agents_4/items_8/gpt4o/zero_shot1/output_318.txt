Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  35  98  16  57  91  78  51
1  25  24  83  85  85  22   0  91
2  44  72  23  14  56  68  86  89
3  85  81  54  67  43  84  11  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing the total satisfaction. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with roughly the same number of items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Sort each item based on the highest value assigned by any agent.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are distributed.

Let's execute this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most with 85.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most with 81.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most with 98.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most with 85.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most with 85.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with 91.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most with 86.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most with 89.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 6, 7
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1

Each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```
