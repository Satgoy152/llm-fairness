Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  59  43  48  58  19  13  68
1  97  45  85  35  98  16  58  52
2  12  26  87  50  31  24   8   0
3  50  35  59  24  93  44  32  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy using a greedy algorithm that considers the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (68), Item 4 (58), Item 1 (59)
   - Allocate: Item 7, Item 1
   - Total value: 68 + 59 = 127

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 0 (97), Item 2 (85)
   - Allocate: Item 4, Item 0
   - Total value: 98 + 97 = 195

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (87), Item 3 (50)
   - Allocate: Item 2, Item 3
   - Total value: 87 + 50 = 137

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Remaining items: Item 5, Item 6
   - Allocate: Item 5, Item 6
   - Total value: 44 + 32 = 76

This allocation gives each agent at least two items, maximizing the overall satisfaction. Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```
