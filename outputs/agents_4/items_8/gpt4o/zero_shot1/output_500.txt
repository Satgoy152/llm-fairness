Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  64  61  40  66  62  93   9
1  41  33  95   9  67  94   6  29
2  20   7  44   0  45  51  69  19
3  94  31  96  25   7  21  33  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one approach:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Ensure all agents receive items:** Adjust the allocation to ensure that all agents receive at least one item.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most (94).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (64).
- **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the most (96).
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (40).
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (67).
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (94).
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most (93).
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most (9).

From this analysis, the initial allocation is skewed towards Agent 0 and Agent 1. We need to adjust so that all agents are treated fairly.

Let's adjust to ensure every agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 3, 6] (removes lower valuation items)
- **Agent 1**: [4, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [7] (gets one item to ensure fairness)
- **Agent 3**: [0, 2]

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the valuation for each item.

Finally, in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation fairly distributes the items while considering the agents' valuations.
