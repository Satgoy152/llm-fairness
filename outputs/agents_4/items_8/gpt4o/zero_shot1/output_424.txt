Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  76  26  88  14  81  78  73
1  11  52  24  52   8  87  76  75
2  55  83  18  35  48  58  46  97
3  42  78  62  22  51  77   2  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents, we should aim for an allocation where each agent receives roughly the same total valuation for their allocated items, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for All Items:**
   - Sum the valuations for each item across all agents to get an idea of the total value distributed.

2. **Estimate Fair Share:**
   - Since there are 8 items and 4 agents, ideally each agent should receive 2 items.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by assigning items based on the highest valuation for each agent until each agent has received 2 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest valuations: Item 3 (88), Item 5 (81)
  
- Agent 1:
  - Highest valuations: Item 5 (87) is already allocated, next are Item 6 (76), Item 7 (75)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest valuations: Item 7 (97) is already allocated, next are Item 1 (83), Item 5 (58) is already allocated, Item 4 (48)

- Agent 3:
  - Highest valuations: Item 7 (91) is already allocated, next are Item 5 (77) is already allocated, Item 1 (78), Item 3 (22) is already allocated, Item 4 (51)

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [6, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 2]

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
