Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16   9  70  82  70  52  97  68
1  92  96  54  24  70  22  15  41
2  74   7  60   4  95  43  79  48
3  85  25  18  88  29  29  61  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 4 agents, we can consider a few approaches, such as maximizing the overall valuation or ensuring each agent receives items with relatively high values to them. Given the valuations, a reasonable approach is to try to allocate items to the agents who value them the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's begin by assigning each item to the agent who has the highest valuation for that item:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it at 92 (highest)
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it at 96 (highest)
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 70 (highest)
4. **Item 3:** Agent 3 values it at 88 (highest)
5. **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it at 95 (highest)
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 52 (highest)
7. **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it at 97 (highest)
8. **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it at 68 (highest)

Now let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 5, 6, 7 (4 items)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1 (2 items)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (1 item)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (1 item)

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it most highly, while also ensuring that all 8 items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
