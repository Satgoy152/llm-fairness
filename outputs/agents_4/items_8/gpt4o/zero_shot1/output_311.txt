Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  86  82  21   2  54   6  96
1  13  84  54  78  81  85  49  63
2  51  55   0  53  61  11  27  34
3  49  85  90  69  52  30  29  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most. 
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Balance the allocations so that no agent has significantly more items than others.

Let's analyze the table to make fair allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (96).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (85).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (61).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (90).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 also values item 0 highly (91). We will allocate it to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (84). We will allocate it to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 reasonably well (53). We will allocate it to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 reasonably well (29). We will allocate it to agent 3.

Each agent has at least 1 item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```
