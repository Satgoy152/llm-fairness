Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39   8  55  44  27  20  29  85
1   8  89  84  40  89  50   3  86
2  22  97  84  23  69  15  99  74
3  38  12  47  59  97  58   7  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. One possible way to achieve this is by considering the highest value each agent places on the items and distributing accordingly. Let's go through the matrix to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 7 (85), Item 2 (55), Item 3 (44)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (89), Item 4 (89), Item 7 (86)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (97), Item 2 (84), Item 6 (99)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (97), Item 3 (59), Item 5 (58)

Now, we need to allocate the items considering these values while ensuring all items are assigned to one agent:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 7 (85) and Item 2 (55)
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 1 (89)
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 6 (99)
- **Agent 3**: Assign Item 4 (97), Item 3 (59), and Item 5 (58)

Items that are left: Item 0

To allocate the remaining item, we select the agent for which the additional item increases the total value they receive:

- **Agent 0**: Value of Item 0 is 39
- **Agent 1**: Value of Item 0 is 8
- **Agent 2**: Value of Item 0 is 22
- **Agent 3**: Value of Item 0 is 38

Assign Item 0 to **Agent 0** because it maximizes their total value received.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent receives items that maximize their valuation.
