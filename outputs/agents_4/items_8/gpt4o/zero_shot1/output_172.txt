Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  59  20  16  12   0  90  67
1  16  36  23   3  69  29  71  88
2  60  33  62  38  51  99  33  84
3  32  46  10  28  26  10  91  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here are the steps to arrive at a fair allocation:

1. **List each agent's highest valued items:** We start by identifying which items are valued the highest by each agent and begin by considering allocating these items to maximize individual agent satisfaction.

2. **Allocate items according to maximum value preferences:** We will try to allocate the items to each agent based on their highest preference, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once.

3. **Adjust allocations to maintain fairness:** If some agents end up with more items than others, adjustments may be necessary to ensure each agent has a fair and similar number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valued items are 6 (90) and 7 (67).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valued items are 7 (88) and 4 (69).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valued items are 5 (99), 2 (62), and 7 (84).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valued items are 6 (91) and 1 (46).

Now, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 6 (90) to maximize value.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 7 (88) to maximize value.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 (99) to maximize value.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6 (91) is already allocated, so allocate item 1 (46).

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and each agent has at least one item. Let's allocate the remaining items considering the next highest values:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (20), as item 6 is already taken.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 (69), as item 7 is already taken.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (38), as item 5 is already taken.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 0 (32), as item 1 is already taken.

Now all 8 items are allocated fairly:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items and maximizes their respective valuations.
