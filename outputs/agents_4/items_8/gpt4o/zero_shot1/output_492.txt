Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  59  64  57  94  83  66  10
1  32  66  40  32  42  46  75  43
2  11  28  51  68  57  11   9  46
3  15  29  67  15  16  44   5  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for item 6.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 2 among all agents.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets some items:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 6
- Agent 2: Items 3, 7
- Agent 3: Items 2, 5

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent gets items based on their higher valuations while distributing all 8 items fairly among the agents.
