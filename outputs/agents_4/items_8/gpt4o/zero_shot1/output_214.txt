Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  42  52  50  64   1  41  63
1  98  25  68   2  59  65  99  81
2  78  86  21  38  24  78  57  21
3  51  56  65  35  14  21   0  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Each agent should get 2 items since there are 8 items and 4 agents.
   
2. **Assign Items Based on Maximum Valuation**:
   - For each agent, assign the item for which they have the highest valuation that hasn't been allocated yet.
   - Then, repeat the process for the next highest valuation for each agent until each agent has 2 items.

3. **Allocation Process**:
   - **Agent 0**: Highest values are 64 (item 4) and 63 (item 7).
   - **Agent 1**: Highest values are 99 (item 6) and 98 (item 0).
   - **Agent 2**: Highest values are 86 (item 1) and 78 (item 5).
   - **Agent 3**: Highest values are 65 (item 2) and 56 (item 3).

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets items 4 and 7.
   - Agent 1 gets items 6 and 0.
   - Agent 2 gets items 1 and 5.
   - Agent 3 gets items 2 and 3.
   
5. **Ensure All Items are Allocated**: Verify that all 8 items (0 through 7) are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 3]
}
```
