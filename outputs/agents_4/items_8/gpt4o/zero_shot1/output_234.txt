Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  22  19  67  58  70  25  42
1  58  27  21  87  60  58  86  13
2  15   9  67  52  87  11  66  86
3  87  82  96  89  11  44  76  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can consider a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item if possible.

Let's determine the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 60 + 22 + 19 + 67 + 58 + 70 + 25 + 42 = 363
- Agent 1: 58 + 27 + 21 + 87 + 60 + 58 + 86 + 13 = 410
- Agent 2: 15 + 9 + 67 + 52 + 87 + 11 + 66 + 86 = 393
- Agent 3: 87 + 82 + 96 + 89 + 11 + 44 + 76 + 97 = 582

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the value for each agent:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 87).
2. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 (value 97).
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 87).
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 70).
5. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (value 86).
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 (value 96).
7. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 60).
8. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (value 82).

This allocation ensures each item is allocated, and attempts to provide a fair distribution of the total valuation.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7, 2, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation received by each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
