Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  52  25  98  20  95  35  73
1   1  25  19  62  91  93  52  40
2  10  84   3  43  15  41  37   2
3   9  46  49  72  95  64  37   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (since there are 8 items and 4 agents, each agent should receive 2 items). Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (98), 5 (95)
   - Allocate items 3 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (93), 4 (91)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 already, so allocate items 4 and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (84), 5 (41)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (84), item 5 is already allocated, so allocate item 0 (10).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (95), 3 (72)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 already, so allocate items 2 and 6 to Agent 3.

We must revise our plan since we realize that some items are over-allocated. Let's try again, ensuring each agent ends up with 2 items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate high-value items 3 (98), 7 (73).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate high-value items 5 (93), 4 (91).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate high-value items 1 (84), 0 (10).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate high-value items 2 (49), 6 (37).

Now, here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [2, 6]
}
```
