Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  28  66  95  33  93  79  58
1  37  73   2  41  64  12  32  12
2  96  82  29  89   0  43  40  21
3  63  10  37  75  45  28  90  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider the valuations provided and ensure each agent gets an equitable share based on their preferences. Here’s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest preferred items for each agent:**

   - Agent 0 has the highest value for item 3 (95).
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for item 1 (73).
   - Agent 2 has the highest value for item 0 (96).
   - Agent 3 has the highest value for item 7 (96).

2. **Allocate these items to the respective agents:**

   - Item 3 goes to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 goes to Agent 1.
   - Item 0 goes to Agent 2.
   - Item 7 goes to Agent 3.

3. **Distribute remaining items considering second highest values:**

   - Remaining items are 2, 4, 5, 6.
   - Agent 0's next highest is item 5 (93), allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest is item 4 (64), allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2's next highest is item 3, but it’s taken. Next is item 1, but it’s taken. Next is item 5, but it’s taken. Next is item 2 (29), allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3's next highest is item 6 (90), allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

4. **Verify allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items 3, 5
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 4
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 2
   - Agent 3: Items 7, 6

This allocation gives each agent a fair distribution of items based on their preferences.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7, 6]
}
```
