Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  39  36  91  14  28  67  20
1   7  21  77  18   9  58   8  45
2  23  38   1  22  99  92  94  56
3  75  39  16  18  46  36  16  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. We will aim to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation maximizes their perceived value, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (97), Item 3 (91)
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (77), Item 5 (58)
   - Allocate Item 2 and Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (99), Item 6 (94)
   - Allocate Item 4 and Item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (75), Item 7 (37)
   - However, Item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 1 and Item 7 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least some of their highly valued items, while all items are distributed. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```
