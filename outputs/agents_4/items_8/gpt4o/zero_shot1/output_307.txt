Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  31  86  42  33   7  52  11
1  57  76   8  76  67  20  22  35
2  54  23  12  47  71   5  32  28
3  26  20  11  27  49  75  13   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and no items are left unallocated.

Here’s one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (96), let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 1 (76) and item 3 (76), so we can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 the most (71), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 5 the most (75), so allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Remaining Items**: We need to allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 6, 7) while considering the remaining valuations and ensuring a fair distribution.

Continuing with the allocations based on the remaining high valuations:
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly (76), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 2 (86), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 has a moderate valuation for item 6 (32), so allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 can take item 7 since it has the least value to others and needs allocation.

Here’s the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
