Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  98  51  44  33  33  91  54
1  56  19  43  37  63  41  44  86
2  35  88  68   8  59  72   9  28
3  81  70   9  76  74  81  61  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[47 98 51 44 33 33 91 54]
 [56 19 43 37 63 41 44 86]
 [35 88 68  8 59 72  9 28]
 [81 70  9 76 74 81 61 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we can adopt a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has highest valuations for items 1 (98) and 6 (91).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Has highest valuations for items 7 (86) and 4 (63).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Has highest valuations for items 5 (72) and 2 (68).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Has highest valuations for items 0 (81) and 3 (76).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, aiming for a fair distribution based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [0, 3]
}
```
