Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  96  66  44  87  72  74  16
1  25  44  38  51  24  24  71  70
2  18  27  37  11  33  41  66  23
3  43  34  39  24  21  81  45  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are assigned. We'll ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items with highest valuations for Agent 0: 1 (96), 4 (87), 0 (74).
   - Allocate Items: [1, 4]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items with highest valuations for Agent 1: 6 (71), 7 (70).
   - Allocate Items: [6, 7]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items with highest valuations for Agent 2: 6 (66), 2 (37).
   - Since item 6 is already allocated to Agent 1, choose next highest available item.
   - Allocate Items: [2]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items with highest valuations for Agent 3: 5 (81), 7 (63), 2 (39).
   - Since items 5, 7, and 2 are already allocated, choose next highest available item.
   - Allocate Items: [0, 3]

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 5 is still available.
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3, as it provides high value.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
