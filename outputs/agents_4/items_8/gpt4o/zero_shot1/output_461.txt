Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  26   3  28  85  83  51  61
1  44  64  63  25  65   7  44  63
2  10  99  66  86  84  16  14  27
3  52  68   1  97  84  31  47  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all agents receive a roughly equal number of items. Each agent should ideally receive 2 items, as there are 8 items and 4 agents.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent while distributing the items as evenly as possible:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (85), Item 0 (83), Item 5 (83)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (65), Item 1 (64), Item 2 (63)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 3 (86), Item 2 (66)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (97), Item 7 (85), Item 1 (68)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 0 and 4 (high values for Agent 0)
- Agent 1: Allocate items 1 and 2 (high values for Agent 1)
- Agent 2: Allocate items 3 and 6 (high values for Agent 2)
- Agent 3: Allocate items 5 and 7 (high values for Agent 3)

This allocation ensures each agent gets 2 items and receives items that they value highly. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```
