Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  13   2  51  84  45  13  11
1  99  38   0  50  77  49  42  33
2  65  66  79  70  47  24  31  57
3  46  76  32  85  22  49  96  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations provided and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

1. **Assigning items to agents:**
   - **Agent 0:** Highest valuation is for item 4 (84), followed by item 0 (70).
   - **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 0 (99), followed by item 4 (77).
   - **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 2 (79), followed by item 1 (66).
   - **Agent 3:** Highest valuation is for item 6 (96), followed by item 3 (85).

2. **Allocation process:**
   - First, assign the highest valued items for each agent:
     - Agent 0 gets item 4
     - Agent 1 gets item 0
     - Agent 2 gets item 2
     - Agent 3 gets item 6

3. **Assign remaining items:**
   - Remaining items are: 1, 3, 5, 7.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (85 valuation).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (66 valuation).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (49 valuation).
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (11 valuation).

4. **Final allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and each agent's highest preference is considered.
