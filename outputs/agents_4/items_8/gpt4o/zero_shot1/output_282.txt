Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  80  82  21  63  76  35  80
1  66  55  16  79   2  34  71  83
2  97  78  24  66  74  40  17   6
3  92  86  20  48  89  18  90  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This can be a complex optimization problem, but for simplicity, I'll use a heuristic method to provide a reasonable allocation.

Let's consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Items 2 (82), 1 (80), and 7 (80).
   - Allocate: Item 2 and Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (83) and Item 3 (79).
   - Allocate: Item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (97), and Item 4 (74).
   - Allocate: Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (89), Item 1 (86), and Item 0 (92).
   - Allocate: Item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, items 3, 5, and 6 are left unallocated. We'll continue allocating them to balance the number of items among agents:

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate: Item 3 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate: Item 5 to Agent 2. 

7. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocate: Item 6 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
