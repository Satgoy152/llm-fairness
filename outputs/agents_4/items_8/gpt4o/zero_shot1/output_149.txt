Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  83  92  95  38  11  34  46
1  48  25  92  10  35  46  51  81
2  58  52  31   9  48  12  29  65
3   6  83  59   6  59  20  21  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent or distribute items in a manner that seems balanced based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0: 20  83  92  95  38  11  34  46
1: 48  25  92  10  35  46  51  81
2: 58  52  31   9  48  12  29  65
3:  6  83  59   6  59  20  21  16
```

We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible.

Let's follow these steps to allocate items fairly:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each agent to ensure they get at least one item they highly value.

2. Allocate items based on maximizing total value for each agent while ensuring no agent is left without an item.

3. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2.
- Agent 2 highly values item 7.
- Agent 3 highly values item 1.

Allocating these high-value items first:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [7]
- Agent 3: [1]

Now allocate the remaining items (0, 4, 5, 6) to agents in such a way that they receive fair valuations:

- Agent 0 can also take item 0.
- Agent 1 can take item 5.
- Agent 2 can take item 6.
- Agent 3 can take item 4.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the allocation is based on maximizing their valuations where possible.
