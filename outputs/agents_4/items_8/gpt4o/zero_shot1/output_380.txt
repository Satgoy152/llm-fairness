Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  59  24  74  89  56  91  87
1  18  31  57  78  29   6  11  36
2  58  96  48  82   6  83  32  91
3  50  69   3  97  65  61  28  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (since we have 8 items and 4 agents). We will assign items based on each agent's highest valuation.

Let's break down the allocation step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 6 (value 91) is the highest value item for Agent 0.
   - Item 7 (value 87) is the next highest.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3 (value 78) is the highest value item for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1 (value 96) is the highest value item for Agent 2.
   - Item 7 would be the next highest, but it's already taken. 
   - Item 3 is the next highest, but it's also taken.
   - Item 5 (value 83) is available.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 3 (value 97) is the highest value item for Agent 3, but it's already taken.
   - Item 1 (value 69) is next, but it's taken.
   - Item 4 (value 65) is available.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one high-value item (based on their preferences), and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item they value highly.
