Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13   5  98  13  97  53  57  53
1  35  36  46  14   5  49  60   6
2   8  43  91  37  10  77  57  62
3  66  32  86  72  19  12  36  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13  5 98 13 97 53 57 53]
 [35 36 46 14  5 49 60  6]
 [ 8 43 91 37 10 77 57 62]
 [66 32 86 72 19 12 36 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes each agent's total valuation. Given the valuations from the table, one approach is to assign items to agents such that the overall satisfaction (total valuation) is maximized for each agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (98), so let's assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most (60), so let's assign item 6 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most (77), so let's assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the most (72), so let's assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, we have 4 items remaining (0, 1, 4, 7) and we need to distribute them while considering the remaining highest valuations for each agent:

5. Agent 0 has high values for items 4 (97) and 7 (53). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
6. Agent 1 values item 0 (35) significantly. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
7. Agent 2 values item 7 (62) after item 5. Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
8. Agent 3 values item 1 (32) reasonably high. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

Thus, the items are fairly allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [3, 1]
}
```
