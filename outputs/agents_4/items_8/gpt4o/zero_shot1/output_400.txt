Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  24  18  23  83   5  89  26
1  19  13  27   9  88  92  30  65
2   3  69  15  17  94  23  46  78
3  41   6  19  28  54  91  28  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for a distribution that maximizes the total satisfaction or valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a balanced portion of the items. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Highest value items are 6 (89) and 0 (83).
   - Agent 1: Highest value items are 5 (92) and 4 (88).
   - Agent 2: Highest value items are 4 (94) and 7 (78).
   - Agent 3: Highest value items are 5 (91) and 4 (54).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate high-value items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring no conflicts:
     - Item 0 to Agent 0
     - Item 4 to Agent 2 (since 94 is the highest single valuation across all items by any agent)
     - Item 5 to Agent 1

3. **Continue Allocation to Maximize Remaining Values:**
   - Remaining high-value items:
     - Item 6 to Agent 0
     - Item 7 to Agent 2
     - Item 1 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it at 69, which is significant)
     - Item 3 to Agent 3
     - Item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it more than others)

4. **Review Allocation:**
   - Ensure each agent receives a fair share, and all items are allocated without exceeding the total.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4, 7],
    "3": [3]
}
```

This distribution attempts to give each agent a fair allocation based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives some items. Adjustments can be made if further fairness is required, but this maintains a balance based on the given valuations.
