Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  91  85  43  69  29  86  89
1  60   9  47  80  13  85  20  14
2  46  96  99  65  18  55  10  40
3  56  68  56  86  40  62  52  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. This involves assigning items to agents such that each agent gets a fair share, taking into account their preferences.

We will use a simple approach where we iteratively assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We'll make adjustments to balance the allocations evenly.

Let's start the allocation process:

1. **Assign item 1 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 96.
2. **Assign item 2 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 99.
3. **Assign item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 at 46, which is the highest value among those left unassigned.
4. **Assign item 3 to Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 86.
5. **Assign item 5 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 85.
6. **Assign item 7 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 7 the highest at 89.
7. **Assign item 4 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 69.
8. **Assign item 6 to Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 6 at 52, which is the highest among remaining assignments.

Now, let's review the allocations to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 7
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6

Each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3, 6]
}
```
