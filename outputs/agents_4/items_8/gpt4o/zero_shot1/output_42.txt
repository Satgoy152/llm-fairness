Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  32  10  26   3  34  31  64
1  84  93  92  81  56  66  87  44
2   0  41  91  44  12  30  23  89
3  91  57  39  27  19  15  51  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations for each item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: We can allocate items that Agent 0 values highly.
2. Agent 1: Allocate the items that Agent 1 values most compared to others.
3. Agent 2: Allocate items to Agent 2 based on their preferences.
4. Agent 3: Finally, allocate items based on Agent 3's preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (82) and item 7 somewhat highly (64).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (93), item 2 (92), and item 6 (87).
- Agent 2 values item 2 (91) the highest and item 7 (89).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (91).

Given these preferences, let's make the allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets items 0 and 6 (values 82 and 31).
2. Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2 (values 93 and 92).
3. Agent 2 gets items 5 and 7 (values 30 and 89).
4. Agent 3 gets items 3 and 4 (values 27 and 19).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.
