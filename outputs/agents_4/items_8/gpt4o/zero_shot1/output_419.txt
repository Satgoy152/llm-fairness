Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3   4  12  32  22  41  62  44
1  37   9  76  95  59  26  61  90
2  54  24  82  73  26  40  39  44
3  78  75  70  51  24  10  13  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for a distribution that maximizes the overall satisfaction across all agents. One approach is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, as much as possible, and that the items they receive have relatively high value for them compared to the other agents.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High values for items: 6 (62), 3 (32), 7 (44)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High values for items: 3 (95), 2 (76), 7 (90)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High values for items: 2 (82), 0 (54), 1 (24)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - High values for items: 0 (78), 1 (75), 7 (56)

Let's allocate items based on these high values while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the most.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 values it the most.

Now each agent has one item, which leaves us with four more items to allocate (1, 4, 5, 7). Let's continue with the allocation:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most after item 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it reasonably well and has room for another item.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 values it highly.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it more than the others.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance giving each agent items they value relatively high, while ensuring all agents receive at least one item.
