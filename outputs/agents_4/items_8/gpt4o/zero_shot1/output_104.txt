Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  78  93  31  37   3  95  21
1   0  88  77  11  30  63  27  33
2  43  20   3   0  45  29  19  93
3  81  51  67  73  27  50  97  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize total happiness or fairness. This usually involves ensuring that each agent gets at least one of their most valued items if possible. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 6 (value: 95)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (value: 88)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 7 (value: 93)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 6 (value: 97), but already taken by Agent 0.
   - Next highest valued item: Item 7 (value: 95), but already taken by Agent 2.
   - Next highest valued item: Item 3 (value: 73)

Now, let's proceed with assigning the remaining items while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0** already has Item 6. We will now look for the second-highest valued unassigned item:
  - Second-highest valued item: Item 2 (value: 93)

- **Agent 1** already has Item 1. We now look for the second-highest valued item available:
  - Second-highest valued item: Item 5 (value: 63)

- **Agent 2** already has Item 7. We now look for the second-highest valued item available:
  - Second-highest valued item: Item 4 (value: 45)

- **Agent 3** already has Item 3. We now look for the second-highest valued unassigned item:
  - Second-highest valued item: Item 0 (value: 81)

After assigning all items, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one high-valued item based on their preferences and all items are distributed.
