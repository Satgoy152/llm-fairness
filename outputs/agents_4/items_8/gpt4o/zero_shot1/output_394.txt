Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  83  82  97  74  32  38   2
1  84  91  56  23  59  19  10  66
2  50  56  32  99  52  58  36  36
3  11  28  60  88  89  41  93  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the four agents while considering their valuations, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents who value them the most. Let's proceed step-by-step to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 84.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 82.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 99.
   - Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most at 89.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 58.
   - Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 93.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most at 66.

2. **Allocate items based on these valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 2
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 7
   - Agent 2: Items 3, 5
   - Agent 3: Items 4, 6

3. **Ensure all agents are represented in the allocation, even if they receive no items.**

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 6]
}
```
