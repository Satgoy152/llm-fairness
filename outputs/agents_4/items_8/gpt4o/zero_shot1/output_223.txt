Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55   1  53  47  46  31  50  68
1  81  13   8  73   9  60  13  18
2  75  95  94  56  62   7  12  13
3  70  16  29  78  25  41  43  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 81 (highest), so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 95 (highest), so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 94 (highest), so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it at 78 (highest), so allocate to Agent 3.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 62 (highest), so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 60 (highest), so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 50 (highest), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 68 (highest), so allocate to Agent 0.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items [6, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 5]
- Agent 2 receives items [1, 2, 4]
- Agent 3 receives item [3]

Now, let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 4],
    "3": [3]
}
```
