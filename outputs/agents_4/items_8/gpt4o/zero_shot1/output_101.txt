Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  96  58  56  67  46   7  72
1  13  37  31  55  18  54  48  11
2  87  49  95  19  24   4  92  36
3  99  51  10  55  24  37  28   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. This can be achieved by evaluating the value each agent places on each item and distributing the items to maximize total happiness.

Let's start with the following approach:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most.
2. Resolve conflicts if multiple agents want the same item by reallocating based on second-highest preferences or other available high-value items.

Here's an outline of the allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Highest value is for item 1 (value 96).
- Agent 1: Highest value is for item 3 (value 55).
- Agent 2: Highest value is for item 2 (value 95).
- Agent 3: Highest value is for item 0 (value 99).

Now, let's assign the remaining items based on the next highest preferences or values:

- Agent 0's second-highest preference is item 0 (value 67).
- Agent 1's second-highest preference is item 5 (value 54).
- Agent 2's second-highest preference is item 6 (value 92).
- Agent 3's second-highest preference is item 1 (value 51), but it's already assigned, so we move to item 5, which is also taken. Hence, they take item 4 (value 24).

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fairly high-value item based on their preferences, and each agent receives at least one item.
