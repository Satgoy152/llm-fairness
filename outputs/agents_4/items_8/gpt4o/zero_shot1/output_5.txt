Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  62  67  65  63  74  30  54
1   9  61  34  81  95  16  57  22
2  58  28  17   4  51  50  48  40
3  36  20  20  30  36  93  28  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent's preferences are considered while also distributing all 8 items. One common method is to use a round-robin approach based on each agent's highest valuation for the remaining items. Hereâ€™s how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 4 (95), so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 3** values item 5 (93) the most, so we allocate item 5 to agent 3.
3. **Agent 0** values item 5 highly as well (74), but since it's already taken, we assign the next highest which is item 2 (67) to agent 0.
4. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (58), so we allocate item 0 to agent 2.
5. Now, back to **Agent 1**, the next highest is item 3 (81), so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
6. For **Agent 3**, item 4 is the next highest (36) but taken, so we allocate item 6 (28) to agent 3.
7. **Agent 0** gets item 1 (62), their next highest valuation.
8. Finally, **Agent 2** gets item 7 (40), their next highest available option.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
