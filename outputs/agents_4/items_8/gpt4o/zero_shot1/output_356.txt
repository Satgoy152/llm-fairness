Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  46  78  44  37  73  99  13
1  80  24  32  63  15  48  72  46
2  84  40  67  21  53  24  94  40
3  64  67  24  93  22  37   2  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations for the items. A common approach is to use a method that fairly distributes items according to the agents' preferences while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the agents' preferences and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 6 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 (80).
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 (84), but since item 0 is already allocated, the next highest is item 6 (94).
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (93).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items by ensuring each agent gets a fair share of total value:

1. **Agent 0**: Already has item 6. Next preferred is item 2 (78).
2. **Agent 1**: Already has item 0. Next preferred is item 3 (63), but it's taken by Agent 3. Next is item 7 (46).
3. **Agent 2**: Already has item 6. Next preferred is item 2 (67), but it's taken. Next is item 4 (53).
4. **Agent 3**: Already has item 3. Next preferred is item 1 (67).

Final allocation of items to agents based on maximizing their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints.
