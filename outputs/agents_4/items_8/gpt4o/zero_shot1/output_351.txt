Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  90   2  87  41  41  41  95
1  70   7   1  98   1  35  83  22
2  38  23  30  79   1  54  29  13
3  95  26  32  13  31   2  60  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A fair allocation could aim to give each agent a bundle of items that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. 
2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Based on the table, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (95).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (90).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (2).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (98).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (41).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (54).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (83).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most (95).

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. If necessary, we can adjust the assignment slightly to balance the allocation.

After adjustment, a fair allocation might look like this:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 4, 7
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 0

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0]
}
```
