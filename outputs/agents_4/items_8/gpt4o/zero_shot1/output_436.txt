Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  30  25  69  44  75  57  53
1  85  88  95  99  31  22  41  19
2  99  64  96  90  83  95  67  55
3  36  42  98  16  70  95  99  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are distributed.

One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. Identify the item with the highest value for each agent.
2. Allocate that item to the respective agent if it hasn't already been allocated.
3. Repeat the process, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's examine the table and make allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (75).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (99).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (96).
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (99).

Allocate these highest-valued items first:

- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.

Now, allocate the remaining items (0, 1, 4, 7) based on the next highest valuations:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (99).
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (88).
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (83).
- Item 7: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (53).

Allocate these items:

- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 0 gets item 7.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 3, 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 0, 4
- Agent 3: Item 6

Verification:

- Total items allocated = 2 (Agent 0) + 2 (Agent 1) + 3 (Agent 2) + 1 (Agent 3) = 8

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [2, 0, 4],
    "3": [6]
}
```
