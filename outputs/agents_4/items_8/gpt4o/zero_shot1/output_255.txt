Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  87  77  62  58  29  21  32
1  67  20  56  98  93  62   8  86
2  68  95  67  72  44  45  72  89
3   8  51  25  47  32   7  46  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to consider a method that balances the total valuations each agent receives. A common approach is to use a method similar to the "round-robin" or "maximin" allocation, where we try to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign the highest-valued item for each agent first as a priority.
2. Ensure that each agent gets an item before assigning a second item to any agent, if possible.
3. Try to balance the total value received by each agent as much as possible.

Based on the table given, here's a potential fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1 (87)
- Agent 1 gets items: 3 (98)
- Agent 2 gets items: 7 (89)
- Agent 3 gets items: 6 (46)

Now, we have allocated 4 items, leaving 4 items to be allocated. We will distribute the remaining items to balance the total values:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (6)
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (93)
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (67)
- Agent 3 gets item 5 (7)

This allocation gives us a total distribution as follows:
- Agent 0: 87 + 6 = 93
- Agent 1: 98 + 93 = 191
- Agent 2: 89 + 67 = 156
- Agent 3: 46 + 7 = 53

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [6, 5]
}
```
