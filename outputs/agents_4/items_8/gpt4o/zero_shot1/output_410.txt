Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88   3  69  42  51  48  70  42
1  90   0  92  57  40  66   1  23
2  15  75  62  91  68  47  83  26
3  31  11  11  10   6  45   2  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88  3 69 42 51 48 70 42]
 [90  0 92 57 40 66  1 23]

 [31 11 11 10  6 45  2 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuations each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets a similar number of items. Given there are 4 agents and 8 items, ideally, each agent should receive 2 items. Here's a possible allocation strategy based on the table:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items with highest values: 0 (88), 6 (70)
   - Allocated items: [0, 6]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items with highest values: 2 (92), 0 (90)
   - Allocated items: [2, 3]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items with highest values: 3 (91), 6 (83)
   - Allocated items: [1, 4]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items with highest values: 7 (70), 5 (45)
   - Allocated items: [5, 7]

Now, let's ensure that we have allocated all items fairly and maximize valuations as much as possible. Here's the JSON format with the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets 2 items, and we have distributed the total of 8 items across the agents.
