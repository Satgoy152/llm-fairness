Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  66  89  35  57  63  59  60
1  59  63  66  86  71   7   9  66
2  70  59  26   7  61  35  28  61
3  63  38  16  72  92   7  26  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. There are multiple ways to approach this, but a common method is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table to allocate the items:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 70.

2. Item 1: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 66.

3. Item 2: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 89.

4. Item 3: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 86.

5. Item 4: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 92.

6. Item 5: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 63.

7. Item 6: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 59.

8. Item 7: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 66.

Now, let's look at the distribution:
- Agent 0 has items: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Agent 1 has items: 3, 7
- Agent 2 has items: 0
- Agent 3 has items: 4

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it most. Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 4 agents.
