Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70   4  78  79  83  76  33  31
1  30   1  17  82  95  58  45  50
2   5  74  48  92   1  38  93  33
3  10  39   9  48  99  96  64   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction. One approach is to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, while also ensuring that every item is allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences**: 
   - Find the highest value each agent has for any item.
   - Allocate these items to each agent where possible.

2. **Balance Allocation**:
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
   - Distribute remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**:
   - Adjust initial allocations to ensure each agent receives items proportionally to their total value preference.

Given the valuations, let's allocate the items:
- Agent 0: Gets item 0, as it values it the highest (70).
- Agent 1: Gets item 4, as it values it the highest (95).
- Agent 2: Gets item 6, as it values it the highest (93).
- Agent 3: Gets item 5, as it values it the second highest (96) after item 4 which is already allocated.

**Allocate Remaining Items:**
- Agent 0: In addition to item 0, get item 2 (valued at 78).
- Agent 1: In addition to item 4, get item 3 (valued at 82).
- Agent 2: In addition to item 6, get item 1 (valued at 74).
- Agent 3: In addition to item 5, get item 7 (valued at 9).

This allocation ensures a fair distribution of items based on agent preferences.

Here's how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [5, 7]
}
```

Each agent is allocated a total of two items, and all eight items are distributed.
