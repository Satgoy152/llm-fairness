Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  74  96  31   7  90  84  11
1  73  58  50  48  29  23  18  25
2  82  51   6  81   4  63  64  54
3  11  68  36  19  58  78  26   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents while taking into account their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the overall value. One common approach is to maximize the total valuation by assigning items to agents based on their highest value per item until all items are distributed. We also need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (96), Item 5 (90), Item 6 (84)
   - Assign Item 2 and Item 5 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (73), Item 1 (58)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (81), Item 6 (64), Item 5 (63)
   - Item 5 and 6 are already taken, so assign Item 3 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (78), Item 1 (68)
   - Item 5 is already taken, so assign Item 1 to Agent 3

Remaining items to allocate: Item 4, Item 6, Item 7

Since we have 4 items already allocated, let's continue:

5. **Allocate Item 6**: 
   - Highest remaining value for Item 6: Agent 2 (64)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2

6. **Allocate Item 4**: 
   - Highest remaining value for Item 4: Agent 3 (58)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 3

7. **Allocate Item 7**: 
   - Highest remaining value for Item 7: Agent 2 (54)
   - Assign Item 7 to Agent 2

After these steps, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 4]

All items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item. Let's write this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 6, 7],
    "3": [1, 4]
}
```
