Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  64   2  20  30  62  91  79
1  54  84   8   7  84  72  39  87
2   5  76  73  18  11  81  18  78
3  52  55  51  22  47  80  67  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A reasonable approach is to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value of the items they receive, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

The total number of items is 8, so each agent should ideally receive 2 items, since there are 4 agents. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation for the items they receive is balanced.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Items: 0, 5
   - Total valuation: 56 (for item 0) + 62 (for item 5) = 118

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Items: 1, 7
   - Total valuation: 84 (for item 1) + 87 (for item 7) = 171

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Items: 2, 6
   - Total valuation: 73 (for item 2) + 18 (for item 6) = 91

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Items: 3, 4
   - Total valuation: 22 (for item 3) + 47 (for item 4) = 69

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 items, and the total valuations for each agent are reasonably balanced given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```
