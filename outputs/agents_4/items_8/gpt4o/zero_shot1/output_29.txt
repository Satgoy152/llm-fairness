Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  65  81  55  33  34   2  38
1  91  54  42  28  40  86  74  43
2  76  92  15  42  84  55   4  44
3  62  60  45  26  97  58  30  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction, we can use a method that ensures each agent's most valued items are considered. We'll use a simple greedy strategy to achieve this by iteratively assigning the highest valued unallocated item to the agent who values it the most and still has fewer than 2 items (since there are 8 items and 4 agents, aiming for an average of 2 items per agent).

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value 91). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
2. Agent 2 values item 1 the most (value 92). Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
3. Agent 3 values item 4 the most (value 97). Allocate item 4 to agent 3.
4. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value 81). Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 5 the next most (value 86). Allocate item 5 to agent 1.
6. Agent 2 values item 3 the next most (value 42). Allocate item 3 to agent 2.
7. Agent 3 values item 7 the next most (value 56). Allocate item 7 to agent 3.
8. Agent 0 values item 6 the next most (value 2). Allocate item 6 to agent 0.

This results in each agent being allocated 2 items:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4, 7]
}
```
