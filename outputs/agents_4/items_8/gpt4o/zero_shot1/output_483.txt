Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  15  53   6  80  39  11  31
1  84  75  71  31  82   4   4  94
2  68  93  81  21  56  19  81  47
3  98  40   8  38  65  16  33  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One approach is to assign items to agents such that each agent receives a reasonable share of their most valued items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (80), Item 2 (53), Item 5 (39)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (94), Item 0 (84), Item 4 (82)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (93), Item 2 (81), Item 6 (81)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (98), Item 4 (65)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, to ensure fair distribution and that all items are allocated, let's allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Next highest valuation after Item 7: Item 0 (84)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 if not already taken, otherwise, allocate Item 3 (31).

6. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest valuation after Item 4: Item 5 (39), Item 2 (53)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Next highest valuation after Item 1: Item 2 (81)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 3**:
   - Next highest valuation after Item 0: Item 6 (33)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3.

Let's ensure no items are double-allocated and adjust if necessary:

1. **Agent 0**: [4, 5]
2. **Agent 1**: [7, 3]
3. **Agent 2**: [1, 2]
4. **Agent 3**: [0, 6]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0, 6]
}
```
