Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  73  35  33  60  74  23  43
1  15  23  92  99  95  31  24  37
2  68  15  32  50   3  79  50   3
3  67  77  49  36  80  77  44  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. This is a combinatorial optimization problem that can be approached in several ways. One method is to use a form of the assignment problem, but since we have 4 agents and 8 items, we can experiment with distributing two items to each agent or any fair combination that maximizes the values.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest valued item available to each agent first, ensuring no duplication.
2. Allocate remaining items based on maximizing the total value for each agent.

Let's go through the steps:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 0 (86) and item 5 (74).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 3 (99) and item 4 (95).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 6 (50) and item 7 (3).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 1 (77) and item 2 (49).

Ensuring that each agent gets a fair share and maximizing their total valuation, we can assign items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 6 and 7
- Agent 3: Items 1 and 2

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
