Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15   7  82  21  47  60  54  77
1  71  55  96  49  31  15  46  56
2  68   6  97  53  10  75  26  74
3  61   3  76  99  82  62  67  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on the table provided, we want to ensure each agent gets roughly equal value. Here's one possible approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Aim to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation maximizes their total valuation.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Total value: 15 + 7 + 82 + 21 + 47 + 60 + 54 + 77 = 363
  - Allocate items with higher values for Agent 0: [2, 7]

- **Agent 1:**
  - Total value: 71 + 55 + 96 + 49 + 31 + 15 + 46 + 56 = 419
  - Allocate items with higher values for Agent 1: [0, 2]

- **Agent 2:**
  - Total value: 68 + 6 + 97 + 53 + 10 + 75 + 26 + 74 = 409
  - Allocate items with higher values for Agent 2: [5]

- **Agent 3:**
  - Total value: 61 + 3 + 76 + 99 + 82 + 62 + 67 + 93 = 543
  - Allocate items with higher values for Agent 3: [3, 4, 7]

**Allocation:**

The allocation needs to be adjusted so that every item is allocated once and only 8 items are distributed in total. Let's adjust the allocation based on maximizing the value for each agent:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items while maximizing each agent's perceived value based on their unique preferences.
