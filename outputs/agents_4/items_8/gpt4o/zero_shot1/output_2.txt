Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  69   9  23  30  45  43  64
1  20  78  79  51  78  44  77  73
2  85  68  16  14  60   4  39  59
3  64   2  79  65   0  91  89  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations. A common approach is to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes or balances the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 1 (69), 7 (64), and 5 (45).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value items are 2 (79), 1 (78), and 4 (78).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 0 (85), 4 (60), and 7 (59).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value items are 7 (95), 5 (91), and 6 (89).

Considering these preferences, we can try to allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items 1 and 0.
- **Agent 1**: Gets items 2 and 4.
- **Agent 2**: Gets items 7 and 3.
- **Agent 3**: Gets items 5 and 6.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly. Now, representing it in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the conditions: each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and each agent receives items they value relatively highly.
