Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  25  79  31  85  15  43  73
1  68   7  41   2  12  90  52  78
2  71  18  29  72  21  30  14  88
3  92  83  30  11  35  22  64  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. Our objective is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by giving each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's consider a strategy where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. 

Here's the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 92.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 83.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 79.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 72.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 85.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 90.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 64.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 88.

Now let's create the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [0, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most, and all items are distributed among the agents.
