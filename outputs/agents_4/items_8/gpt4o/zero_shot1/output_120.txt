Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  86   8  82  55  93  17  17
1  97  56  95  36   3  80  21  69
2  83   4  15  22  32  10  14   2
3  20  39  97  63  50  90  14   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

2. If there are ties in valuation for an item, we can assign the item to any of the agents involved in the tie.

Here's how the allocation can be done step-by-step:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 97.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 82.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 55.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 21.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most at 69.

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total of 4 items (1, 3, 4, 5), Agent 1 a total of 3 items (0, 6, 7), Agent 2 no items, and Agent 3 a total of 1 item (2).

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 6, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2]
}
```
