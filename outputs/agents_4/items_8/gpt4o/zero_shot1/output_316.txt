Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  47  59  22  15  86  77  78
1  42  37  78  30  66  78  60  22
2  67  97  61  24  19  59  81  21
3  66  12  84  76  79   4  50  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets roughly an equal number of items. Given there are 4 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally get 2 items.

Here's a possible approach to allocate the items:

1. Identify each agent's top-valued items and allocate them, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

2. Balance the allocation by ensuring each agent gets 2 items.

Let's consider the allocations based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0:
   - Top valuations are for items 0 (92) and 5 (86).

2. Agent 1:
   - Top valuations are for items 2 (78) and 5 (78), but item 5 is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next highest available valuation is for item 4 (66).

3. Agent 2:
   - Top valuations are for items 1 (97) and 6 (81).

4. Agent 3:
   - Top valuations are for items 4 (79) and 2 (84), but item 2 is already allocated to Agent 1.
   - Next highest available valuation is for item 3 (76).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 6
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 7]
}
```
