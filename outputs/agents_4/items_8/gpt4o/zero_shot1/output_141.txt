Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  91  54  67  32  21   5  38
1   5  61  80  71  71  98  98   0
2  99   0  69   3  81   8  54  97
3  32  98  28  98  69  78  44  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 5 61 80 71 71 98 98  0]

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and that all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations and determine a possible allocation:

Agent 0:
- Highest values: Item 1 (91), Item 0 (76), Item 3 (67)

Agent 1:
- Highest values: Item 5 (98), Item 6 (98), Item 2 (80)

Agent 2:
- Highest values: Item 0 (99), Item 7 (97), Item 4 (81)

Agent 3:
- Highest values: Item 1 (98), Item 3 (98), Item 5 (78)

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 2 (99)
2. **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 3 (98)
3. **Item 2**: Allocated to Agent 1 (80) as it is their highest available value after removing item 5 and 6.
4. **Item 3**: Allocated to Agent 0 (67) as their next highest available value.
5. **Item 4**: Allocated to Agent 2 (81) as it is their next highest available value.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 1 (98)
7. **Item 6**: Allocated to Agent 1 (98) as it is their next highest available value.
8. **Item 7**: Allocated to Agent 2 (97) as it is their next highest available value.

### Allocations:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [2, 5, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 4, 7]
- Agent 3: [1]

Here's the JSON format for these allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 7],
    "3": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and ensures all items are distributed.
