Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  46  45  86  28  61  43  72
1  21   2  72  34  57  14  69  10
2  89  28  94  67  45  75   7  82
3  50  48  53  62  42  71  81  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. A common approach is to distribute the items such that the overall valuation for each agent is as high as possible, while ensuring all items are allocated. Let's follow a simple heuristic to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If any agent ends up with more than 2 items, reallocate items to ensure each agent has at least 1 item, if possible.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2 (89).
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (46).
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 2 (94).
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 0 (86).
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 1 (57).
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 2 (75).
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 3 (81).
- Item 7 is valued highest by Agent 0 (72).

After the initial allocation based on highest value, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 7
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 3: Item 6

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2, 5],
    "3": [6]
}
```
