Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  58  26  64  35  10  38  56
1  35  91  20  16  49  82  52  19
2  79  84  90  44  83  30  31  84
3  19  61  54  25  17  65  17  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. A common approach for fairness is to use the "maximum sum" or "maximum valuation" method while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. First, determine the highest valuation for each item and allocate that item to the agent with the highest valuation for it.
2. If some agents have too many items or some have none, adjust the allocation to ensure everyone gets at least one item.

Let's work through this:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by agent 2 (79)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 1 (91)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 2 (90)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 0 (64)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 2 (83)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by agent 1 (82)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by agent 1 (52)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by agent 2 (84)

Initial allocation based on highest valuations:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1, 5, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 4, 7]
- Agent 3: []

Agent 3 has no items, so we need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness. Let's adjust by reallocating some items:

Final fair allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 4]
- Agent 3: [6, 7]

This ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [6, 7]
}
```
