Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28   9  75  40  94  71  87   3
1  73  46  46  14  54  11  29  86
2  23  58  10  30  28  29  62  20
3  96  42  32  12  23  26  58  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences. However, since the total number of items is 8 and there are 4 agents, each agent will ideally receive 2 items to ensure a fair distribution.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (94), Item 6 (87)
   - Allocate: Items 4 and 6

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (73), Item 7 (86)
   - Allocate: Items 0 and 7

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (58), Item 6 (62) [but Item 6 is already allocated]
   - Next highest valuations: Item 5 (29), Item 3 (30)
   - Allocate: Items 1 and 3

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (96) [but Item 0 is already allocated]
   - Next highest valuations: Item 7 (96) [but Item 7 is already allocated]
   - Next highest valuations: Item 2 (32), Item 5 (26)
   - Allocate: Items 2 and 5

Let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and the items are distributed based on the highest valuations as much as possible while keeping the allocation fair.
