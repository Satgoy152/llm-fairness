Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  50  59  74  53  71  74   9
1   0  26  27  80  96  45  28  29
2  59  61  77  78  39  43  95  32
3  72  23  96  89  52  69  77  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated sums up to 8. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, 5, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 4 and 3.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 2 and 6.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 2 and 3.

Considering these preferences and ensuring each agent receives a fair allocation, we can distribute the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Receives items [0, 5]. These have relatively high valuations for agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Receives items [3, 4]. These are the highest value items for agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Receives items [6, 2]. These are highly valued by agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Receives items [1, 7]. These provide a balanced allocation for agent 3.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items according to their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
