Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  30  70  27  67  65  42  90
1  98  54   2  63  72  24  24  78
2  34  10  84  10  75  28  66  83
3  62  95  27  20  26   2  97  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 54  2 63 72 24 24 78]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all 8 items are allocated. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Identify the highest value item for each agent:** This helps ensure each agent has a priority item or items they value highly.
2. **Allocate items based on maximizing total value:** Try to allocate items such that the total value across all agents is maximized, but each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. **Ensure all items are distributed:** Adjust allocations to ensure all items are given out while keeping individual allocations as fair as possible.

Let's work through the allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Very high value on item 7 (90) and item 2 (70). Choose item 7 for maximum value.
- **Agent 1:** Highest value on item 0 (98). Choose item 0.
- **Agent 2:** Highest value on item 2 (84). Choose item 2.
- **Agent 3:** Highest value on item 6 (97). Choose item 6.

Now we have allocated 4 items (0, 2, 6, 7), and 4 items remain to be allocated (1, 3, 4, 5).

Let's distribute the remaining items to balance the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Already has item 7. Next highest is item 4 (67). Allocate item 4.
- **Agent 1:** Already has item 0. Next highest is item 4, but it's taken by Agent 0, so item 3 (63). Allocate item 3.
- **Agent 2:** Already has item 2. Next highest value is item 7, but it's taken, so item 6 (66). Allocate item 5.
- **Agent 3:** Already has item 6. Next highest value is item 1 (95). Allocate item 1.

All 8 items are now allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6, 1]
}
```
