Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  72  18  36  79  44  66  16
1  96  43  75  19  83  92  46  53
2  66  84  21  64  66   4   8  94
3  54  89  95  77   9  83  38  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items**: 
   - Item 4 (79)
   - Item 1 (72)

2. **Agent 1's highest valued items**:
   - Item 0 (96)
   - Item 5 (92)

3. **Agent 2's highest valued items**:
   - Item 1 (84)
   - Item 7 (94)

4. **Agent 3's highest valued items**:
   - Item 2 (95)
   - Item 3 (77)

Based on the valuations, here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives items [4, 1]
- **Agent 1** receives items [0, 5]
- **Agent 2** receives items [7]
- **Agent 3** receives items [2, 3, 6]

Note that Agent 2 ends up with only one item, but it's their highest valued available option given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
