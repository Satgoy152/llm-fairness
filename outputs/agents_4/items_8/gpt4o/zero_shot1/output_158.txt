Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  78  23  11  56  19  55  60
1  51  78  63  58  24  79  30  89
2  16  97   7  44  45  38   5  85
3  37   8   4  20  96  43  84  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 4 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. We can start by considering the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate them in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valued items are 1 (78) and 0 (75).
   - Allocate items 0 and 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valued items are 7 (89) and 5 (79).
   - Allocate items 7 and 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valued items are 1 (97) and 7 (85), but item 1 and 7 are already allocated.
   - Next highest are items 4 (45) and 3 (44).
   - Allocate items 3 and 4 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest valued items are 4 (96) and 6 (84), but item 4 is already allocated.
   - Allocate items 6 and the remaining item 2 to agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 8. 

Here's the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6, 2]
}
```
