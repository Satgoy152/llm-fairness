Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  58   4  28  57  26  87  99
1  56  89  39  33  96  45   7  79
2  26  46  57  53  68   2  41  57
3  95  52  19  38  55  69  15  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (assuming that this is part of the fairness criteria). We will try to allocate items so that the total value for each agent is balanced as much as possible.

Let's analyze and allocate:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - High-valued items for Agent 0 are items 7 (99), 6 (87), 1 (58).
   - We can allocate item 7 (value 99) and item 1 (value 58) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - High-valued items for Agent 1 are items 4 (96), 1 (89), 7 (79).
   - We can allocate item 4 (value 96) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - High-valued items for Agent 2 are items 4 (68), 2 (57), 7 (57).
   - We can allocate item 2 (value 57) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**  
   - High-valued items for Agent 3 are items 0 (95), 5 (69), 1 (52).
   - We can allocate item 0 (value 95) and item 5 (value 69) to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated:
- Agent 0: items 7 and 1
- Agent 1: item 4
- Agent 2: item 2
- Agent 3: items 0 and 5

We have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.

5. **Remaining items:**  
   - Items 3 and 6 are still unallocated.
   - Agent 0: item 3 (28)
   - Agent 1: item 6 (7)

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [7, 1, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 5]
}
```
