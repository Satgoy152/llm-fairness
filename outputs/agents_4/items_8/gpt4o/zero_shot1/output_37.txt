Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  55  89  29  46  19  17  16
1  10  99  31  99  15  57  24  97
2   2  48  29  67  45  38  52  69
3  53  40  72   1   6  33  58   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll attempt to maximize the total value each agent gets according to their preferences. We can use a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and that exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

Let's evaluate the highest value for each item and allocate it accordingly:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 89.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 46.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 57.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 58.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.

Now, let's distribute the items based on the above evaluation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 2, 4]
- Agent 1 gets items: [1, 3, 5, 7]
- Agent 2 gets no items.
- Agent 3 gets item: [6]

Thus, the allocation in the required JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6]
}
```
