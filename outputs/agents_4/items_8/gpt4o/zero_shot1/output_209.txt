Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78   7  98  76  44   1  81  58
1  73  57  39   1  49  89  14  45
2  22  97  74  86  98  18  66  91
3  16  89  37  57  94  15  95  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's evaluate the allocations step by step. We will aim to balance the allocations based on the total valuation each agent would receive:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values for Agent 0 are item 2 (98) and item 0 (78).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values for Agent 1 are item 5 (89) and item 0 (73).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values for Agent 2 are item 4 (98) and item 1 (97).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest values for Agent 3 are item 7 (96) and item 6 (95).

Now, let's allocate these items considering both their valuations and ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value: 98).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value: 89).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value: 97).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (value: 96).

We've allocated 4 items, and each agent has one item. Now, we need to allocate the remaining 4 items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 78), maximizing their total to 176.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value: 98), maximizing their total to 195.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value: 95), maximizing their total to 191.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 1), since it has low value for everyone else and Agent 1 has a higher valuation on the remaining items.

With this allocation, each item is distributed, and each agent gets a total valuation that is balanced as much as possible.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [7, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
