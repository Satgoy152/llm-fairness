Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  17  65  96  43  59  79  51
1  19  75  21   2  94  38  89  21
2  51  16  35  49  76  44   9  63
3  65  69  93  30  95  69  83  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets roughly equal value from the items they receive. We will consider the valuations given in the table and try to optimize the distribution based on maximizing the total value for each agent, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Items: 3, 7
   - Total Value: 96 (item 3) + 51 (item 7) = 147

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 4, 6
   - Total Value: 94 (item 4) + 89 (item 6) = 183

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items: 0, 5
   - Total Value: 51 (item 0) + 44 (item 5) = 95

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items: 1, 2
   - Total Value: 69 (item 1) + 93 (item 2) = 162

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation for the items they receive. Each agent receives exactly 2 items, ensuring a fair distribution.

The JSON representation of this allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 2]
}
```
