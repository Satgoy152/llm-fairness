Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 4 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  28  49  99   9  18  79  57
1  38  71  43  56  42  69  32  37
2   6  77  92  49   4  62  30  69
3  45  14  11  65  92  50  92  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple method to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately equal total value. We will try to maximize fairness by ensuring that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and perform a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with high value for Agent 0: 3 (99), 2 (49), 6 (79)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items with high value for Agent 1: 1 (71), 5 (69)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items with high value for Agent 2: 2 (92), 7 (69)
   
4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items with high value for Agent 3: 4 (92)

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the total valuations:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Hereâ€™s the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [4, 0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives two items, and the total valuation is balanced as fairly as possible given the constraints.
