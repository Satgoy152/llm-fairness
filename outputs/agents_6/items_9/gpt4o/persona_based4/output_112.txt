Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  29  70  28   9  41  90  98  74
1  28  57  86  40  22   9  69  55   5
2  23  58  87  65  94  25  41  19  39
3  14  28  57  43  35  97  41   2  59
4  49  22  10   4  93  71  63  19  29
5  62  61  13  57  21  80  22  77  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free and proportionally fair distribution based on the given valuations. Envy-freeness typically means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity and the constraints, we will attempt to find a balanced allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values items 6, 7. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the most. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the most. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the most. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 4 the most, but it's taken. Next highest is item 5 which is also taken. Next is item 0. Allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 0 the most but it's taken. Next highest is item 8. Allocate item 8 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 3 more items.

7. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued.
8. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
9. Allocate item 3 to Agent 5.

This approach ensures that every agent gets at least one item they value relatively higher compared to other agents, thus minimizing envy.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [8, 3]
}
```
