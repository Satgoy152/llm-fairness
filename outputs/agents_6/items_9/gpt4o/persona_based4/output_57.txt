Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  36  12  95  28  16  22  92  28
1  68  65  40  35  11  39  88  94  10
2  86  76  55   5  95  62  75  38  17
3  22  53  69  63  71  20  36   4  12
4  82  19  52  33  51  83  69  94  52
5  87  37  15  97  67  26  70   3   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [87 37 15 97 67 26 70  3  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we will aim to minimize envy among agents, ensuring each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as others' allocations according to their valuations. Here is one way to achieve this:

### Steps:

1. **Determine Preferences:** Look at the valuations each agent has for each item. Identify which items are most highly valued by each agent.

2. **Assign Items:** Attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total value. 

3. **Balance Allocations:** Ensure that the number of items allocated is balanced among agents to the extent possible, aiming for fairness and minimizing envy.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (95) and item 7 (92).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 7 (94) and item 6 (88).
- **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (86) and item 4 (95).
- **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (71) and item 2 (69).
- **Agent 4** highly values item 5 (83) and item 7 (94).
- **Agent 5** highly values item 3 (97) and item 0 (87).

Considering these preferences, we aim to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is maximized while ensuring no agent feels that another agent has a better allocation, given their own preferences.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items [3, 7], which they value highly.
- **Agent 1** gets items [6], which they value highly.
- **Agent 2** gets items [0, 4], which they value highly.
- **Agent 3** gets items [2], which is one of their higher valued items.
- **Agent 4** gets items [5], which is a highly valued item.
- **Agent 5** gets items [1, 8], which balances the total number of items among agents.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1, 8]
}
```

This allocation grants each agent a subset of items they value highly, while ensuring a fair distribution of the total number of items.
