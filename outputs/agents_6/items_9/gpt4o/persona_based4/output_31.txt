Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  35  20  36  70   2  12   8  24
1  55  57  48  76   9  38  66  44  24
2  33  20  93  51  13  36  42  39  29
3  76  66  36  52  45  82  82  54  92
4   7  15  25  22  77  12   1  36  11
5  88  16  86  50  35  54  36  71   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ an allocation method that seeks to minimize envy among agents, such as the Envy-Free (EF) criterion. In practice, exact envy-freeness is challenging to achieve, especially with indivisible goods, but we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible.

The goal here is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable allocation, considering the constraints.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for item 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Has the highest valuation for item 1.

Distributing the remaining items by considering the next highest valuation:

- Item 6: Allocate to Agent 3 (also values item 5 highly).
- Item 7: Allocate to Agent 5 (after items 0 and 2).
- Item 8: Allocate to Agent 3 (has a high valuation for it).

With this distribution, we check if each agent receives at least one item and attempt to ensure the allocations reflect their preferences as much as possible. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 6, 8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to account for each agent's preferences while ensuring all items are distributed. Each agent receives at least one item, and we have allocated all 9 items.
