Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  40  58  38  61  95  52  88  48
1  58  79  58  39  62  64  50  67  53
2  57  70  77  85  43  95  86  21  93
3  71  56   8  58   5  47  57  62  52
4  67  62  44   2  52  51  15  25  75
5   8  69  14  80  54   1  15  58  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them such that no agent envies another's allocation. This is a challenging problem, especially when ensuring envy-freeness, but we can attempt to create a division that is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 5 and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively balanced valuation, but items 1 and 5 are among the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values items 2, 5, and 8 highly.
4. **Agent 3** has a significant preference for item 0.
5. **Agent 4** values items 0 and 8 more than others.
6. **Agent 5** values item 8 the highest, followed by item 3.

Let's allocate the items trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 7]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Item [2, 6]
- Agent 3: Item [0]
- Agent 4: Item [8]
- Agent 5: Item [3, 4]

This allocation attempts to give each agent some of their higher-valued items while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```
