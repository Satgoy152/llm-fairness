Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  34  43  29  65  17  40   5  36
1  26  28  81  99  56  18  63  67  38
2  99  51  40  77  67  46  12  13  72
3  49  30   7   2  75  81  41  22  59
4  85  51  15  61  77  89   6   9  41
5  77  24  22  99  96  31  33   8  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to achieve envy-freeness or, at the very least, minimize envy among the agents. One common method for achieving fair division is the "sequential allocation" where each agent picks their most valued remaining item in turns.

Given the valuations, we can proceed by allocating items in a way that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation of their assigned items. Here is one way to do it:

1. Assign the highest valued item on each row to the respective agent.
2. Continue assigning remaining items to maximize fairness and ensure each agent gets a chance to pick.

Following this approach:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value 43).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (value 99).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (value 99).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (value 81).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most, but it's already taken, so item 1 is next (value 51).
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most, but it's already taken, so item 4 is next (value 96).

After these initial allocations, we continue to allocate the remaining items while considering the highest remaining valuations:

- Agent 0 next highest valuation is for item 4 (value 65).
- Agent 1 next highest valuation is for item 7 (value 67).
- Agent 2 next highest valuation is for item 8 (value 72).

Let's allocate the items based on this strategy:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has a combination of items that maximizes their own total value given the constraints, and we ensure all items are allocated.
