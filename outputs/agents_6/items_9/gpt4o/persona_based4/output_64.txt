Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  24  49  91   6  56  94  85  49
1  45  51   6  27  48  76  32  82  92
2  85  62  78  20  49  28   3  71  42
3  90   5  48  31  40  75  78  67  46
4  33  46  83  84  39  26  62  40  29
5   3  63  71  89  33  41  28  29  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their perceived value, while also trying to minimize envy among agents. Given the valuations table, we can proceed with a simple round-robin allocation or a similar heuristic approach to ensure a fair distribution. Let's attempt the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 6 (94), allocate item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 8 (92), allocate item 8.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 0 (85), allocate item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 0 (tie with 90) but already taken, next highest is item 5 (75), allocate item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 3 (84), allocate item 3.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value for item 3 (tie with 89) but already taken, next highest is item 1 (63), allocate item 1.

Now, we have allocated 6 items and need to allocate 3 more items:

7. **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 3 (91) but already taken, next item 7 (85), allocate item 7.
8. **Agent 2**: Next highest is item 2 (78), allocate item 2.
9. **Agent 4**: Next highest is item 4 (39), allocate item 4.

All items have been allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent given their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.
