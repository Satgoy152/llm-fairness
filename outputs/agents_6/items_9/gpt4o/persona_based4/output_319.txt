Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  95  36  33  30   0   2  61  28
1  41  78  60  79  60  59  17  86  87
2  13  39  15  87   1  43  97  30  29
3  27  40   8  92  97  99  49  56  29
4  12  81  64  74   9  19  97   2  69
5  14  55  52  58  42  35  42  13  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents with consideration for envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly, minimizing envy among them. We need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's examine each agent's top preferences and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the highest (95).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 8 the highest (87) and item 3 highly (79).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the highest (97).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the highest (99) and item 4 highly (97).
5. **Agent 4**: Values items 6 most (97) but it's already taken, so next high is item 1 (81).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 3 the highest (58).

We will try to allocate items to each agent while respecting their preferences and achieving a fair distribution. Note that some compromise is necessary, but we will aim to maximize satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: [1] (most valued item)
- **Agent 1**: [8, 3] (two highly valued items)
- **Agent 2**: [6] (most valued item)
- **Agent 3**: [5, 4] (two highly valued items)
- **Agent 4**: [7] (next high item after 6 is taken)
- **Agent 5**: [0, 2] (next high items after 3 is taken)

This allocation gives each agent items they highly value and covers all 9 items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [8, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```
