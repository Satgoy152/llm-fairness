Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  93  95  33  24  44  87  89  32
1  36  92  27  77  92  58  95  88  54
2  57  44  24  27  73  98  15  32  93
3  95  24  68  73  87  20   0  38   3
4  78  72  25  32  78  62  59  99  91
5  42  39  32  26  82  77  86  62  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair according to their own valuation. One potential method for allocating items is the "round-robin" method or similar allocation strategies that attempt to minimize envy.

We'll proceed with the allocation by considering each agent's preferences and distributing items such that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share relative to their valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Calculate the total valuations for each agent across all items.
2. **Allocate Items**: Start allocating items to agents based on their highest preference to minimize envy.

Let's begin with the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 2, 1, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 6, 4, and 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 5, 8, and 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 0, 4, and 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers items 7, 8, and 0.
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers items 6, 5, and 4.

### Allocation Strategy:
We aim to minimize envy by allocating the most valued items first and ensuring each agent gets a fair share of their most valued items. Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 1]
- **Agent 1**: [6]
- **Agent 2**: [5]
- **Agent 3**: [0]
- **Agent 4**: [7, 8]
- **Agent 5**: [3, 4]

Each agent gets at least one of their most preferred items, and all 9 items are allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7, 8],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has a fair share of items based on their preferences, minimizing envy among agents.
