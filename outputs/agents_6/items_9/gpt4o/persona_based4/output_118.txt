Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  30  34  25  17  86  51  49  39
1  84  48  59  66  51  21   6  62  78
2   6  87  66  38  51  56  89  42  45
3  88  74  40  38  88  79   6  99  73
4  78  89  86  62  65  68  47  44   4
5  52  70  89  91  49   7  67  70  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly divide the items among the agents, we would aim for an allocation that tries to minimize envy and respects each agent's valuations as much as possible. In this case, since we have 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but we will strive for a distribution that minimizes overall envy.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Total Items**: 9 items.
2. **Total Agents**: 6 agents.
3. **Objective**: Allocate items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, minimizing envy.

Given the complexity of finding an envy-free allocation, we will make an attempt that is as fair as possible by iterating through the items and assigning them based on the highest value to the agents who value them most, ensuring every agent gets at least a chance for an item:

### Allocation Plan:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 5 highly (86).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 highly (84).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 6 highly (89).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 7 highly (99).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 1 highly (89).
- **Agent 5**: Values item 2 highly (89).

Now, we continue to distribute the remaining items in a manner that attempts to balance overall value distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Item 8 (39).
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (51).
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (38).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and tries to match the highest preferences where possible while ensuring fair distribution.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This distribution ensures each agent receives items, and the allocation aims to respect the highest preferences of each agent, given the constraints.
