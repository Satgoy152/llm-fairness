Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  62  14  14  87  32  61  11  42
1  44  86   5  85  53  43   9  80  79
2  42  14  68  11  27  52  57  13  15
3  96  12  77  95  83  76   5   2  51
4  94  25  38   7  90  45  54  94  89
5  90  41  68  39  92  21  12  82  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the six agents, we'll aim to minimize envy among the agents, which means each agent should value their allocation at least as much as they value anyone else's allocation. Given the valuations, we can use a greedy approach to allocate items based on optimizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each gets at least one item (where possible) and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Let's start by considering the highest-valued items for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the most (87).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the most (86).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the most (68).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the most (96).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 the most (94) but since item 0 is taken, next highest is item 4 (90).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 4 the most (92) but since item 4 is taken, next highest is item 0 (90).

We will start by allocating these highest-valued items:

- Allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- Allocate item 0 to agent 3.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 4 (since item 4 was allocated to agent 0).
- Allocate item 7 to agent 5 (after considering agent 5's highest preferences available).

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and we must allocate 3 more to reach a total of 9. We'll distribute the remaining items while trying to maintain fairness:

7. **Remaining items**: 5, 6, 8.

- Allocate item 5 to agent 2 (as they value it relatively high).
- Allocate item 6 to agent 4 (they value it decently, and it balances their allocation).
- Allocate item 8 to agent 5 (it is one of the higher remaining values for them).

With these allocations, each agent receives at least one item (where possible), and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value and attempts to distribute value fairly.
