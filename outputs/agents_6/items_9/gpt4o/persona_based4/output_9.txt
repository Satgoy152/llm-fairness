Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  89  76  39  74  23  13  30  93
1  66  38  34  48  22  31  72  75  30
2  99  86  65  14  83  64  50  74  27
3  95  83  57  59  70  12  76  48  61
4   1  61   1  23  34   8  68  88  19
5  85  90  91   9  91   8  94  37  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing social welfare while trying to ensure envy-freeness. A common approach is to use algorithms like the round-robin or the maximum Nash welfare solution. Here, we will attempt a balanced allocation based on the valuations to ensure each agent is satisfied as much as possible.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuations matrix:

```
Agent Valuations:
0: [78, 89, 76, 39, 74, 23, 13, 30, 93]
1: [66, 38, 34, 48, 22, 31, 72, 75, 30]
2: [99, 86, 65, 14, 83, 64, 50, 74, 27]
3: [95, 83, 57, 59, 70, 12, 76, 48, 61]
4: [1, 61, 1, 23, 34, 8, 68, 88, 19]
5: [85, 90, 91, 9, 91, 8, 94, 37, 10]
```

The goal is to allocate each item to an agent such that the total value perceived by the agents is maximized, and the allocation is as envy-free as possible. 

Let's proceed with a simple greedy allocation strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure no agent is left with zero items if possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (99)
- Item 1: Agent 5 (90)
- Item 2: Agent 5 (91)
- Item 3: Agent 3 (59)
- Item 4: Agent 5 (91)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (64)
- Item 6: Agent 5 (94)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (30)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (93)

Now check to ensure each agent receives at least one item:
- Agent 0: Items [7, 8]
- Agent 1: No items, reassign item 3 from Agent 3 to Agent 1 since Agent 3 has a lower valuation for item 3 than Agent 1 does for item 0.
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 3: No items, reassign item 7 from Agent 0 to Agent 3
- Agent 4: No items, reassign item 5 from Agent 2 to Agent 4
- Agent 5: Items [1, 2, 4, 6]

Adjustments:
- Agent 0: [8]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [1, 2, 4, 6]

Thus, the allocation can be presented as:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item.
