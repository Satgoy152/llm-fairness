Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  79  53  78  22  66  44   6  73
1  64   9  96  56  45  64  96  16  23
2  80  51  45  15  93  64  63  49  37
3  72  37  91  71  30  29  73  11  98
4  65  34  50  63  42  56  60   6  19
5  49  57  61  64  25  81  55  79  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, I'll use a simple heuristic approach to achieve a reasonably fair allocation. 

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: Total value = 13 + 79 + 53 + 78 + 22 + 66 + 44 + 6 + 73 = 434
- Agent 1: Total value = 64 + 9 + 96 + 56 + 45 + 64 + 96 + 16 + 23 = 469
- Agent 2: Total value = 80 + 51 + 45 + 15 + 93 + 64 + 63 + 49 + 37 = 497
- Agent 3: Total value = 72 + 37 + 91 + 71 + 30 + 29 + 73 + 11 + 98 = 512
- Agent 4: Total value = 65 + 34 + 50 + 63 + 42 + 56 + 60 + 6 + 19 = 395
- Agent 5: Total value = 49 + 57 + 61 + 64 + 25 + 81 + 55 + 79 + 28 = 499

Next, we'll use a round-robin selection where each agent, in order of their total value, picks the highest-valued item still available to them until all items are allocated.

Here is a fair allocation based on the above method:

1. Agent 3 picks item 8 (value 98).
2. Agent 5 picks item 5 (value 81).
3. Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 93).
4. Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 96).
5. Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 78).
6. Agent 4 picks item 0 (value 65).

Now continue allocating:

7. Agent 3 picks item 6 (value 73).
8. Agent 5 picks item 7 (value 79).
9. Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 80).

Here is the final allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [8, 6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 7]
}
```

Note: The above allocations are based on maximizing each agent's individual satisfaction per their own valuations, thus aiming for an envy-free allocation in this context. Some agents may receive more items than others due to their valuation preferences.
