Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  77  59  71  94  21   4  14  67
1  99  21  56  54  78  53  69  60  36
2  28  44  68  31  21  21  15  60   5
3  46  46  99  37  18  32  23  29   8
4  47   9  86   1   6  31  15  45  32
5   4  16  17  56  84  70  26  40  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, one common approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle based on their valuations. While it's often challenging to perfectly achieve envy-freeness, especially when there are constraints like integer allocation, we can try to approximate it by considering the agents' valuations and distributing the items accordingly.

Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally receive 1 or 2 items. To approach an envy-free allocation, we can attempt to distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent, trying to satisfy the preferences as much as possible.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. First, identify the item with the highest value for each agent and allocate it to them if possible.
2. Then, distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest values.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is item 4 (value = 94).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is item 0 (value = 99).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is item 2 (value = 68).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value is item 2 (value = 99). Since item 2 is already taken by agent 2, assign the second highest, item 0 (value = 46).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value is item 2 (value = 86), but it is taken. Assign the next highest, item 8 (value = 32).
6. **Agent 5:** Highest value is item 4 (value = 84), but it is taken. Assign the next highest, item 5 (value = 70).

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- Item 1: Assign to Agent 0, their second highest (value = 77).
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 5, their next highest (value = 56).
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 1, their next highest (value = 69).
- Item 7: Assign to Agent 3, their next highest (value = 29).

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the agents' highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
