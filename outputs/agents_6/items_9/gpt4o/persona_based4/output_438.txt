Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22   2  83  15  75  49  44  30  37
1  48  41  67  63  88  33  89  23  11
2  78  38  95  56  70   3  76  35   2
3  75  23  23  93  59  11  98  19  34
4  19  26  57  97  38  76  18  12  16
5  80  52  51  24  28  63  58  66  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure the distribution is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible based on the given valuations. This means each agent should value their allocation at least as much as any other agent values their allocation.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items combined and then try to allocate items so that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation relative to others.

### Valuation Table
The valuations are:

- Agent 0: [22, 2, 83, 15, 75, 49, 44, 30, 37]
- Agent 1: [48, 41, 67, 63, 88, 33, 89, 23, 11]
- Agent 2: [78, 38, 95, 56, 70, 3, 76, 35, 2]
- Agent 3: [75, 23, 23, 93, 59, 11, 98, 19, 34]
- Agent 4: [19, 26, 57, 97, 38, 76, 18, 12, 16]
- Agent 5: [80, 52, 51, 24, 28, 63, 58, 66, 13]

### Total Valuation for Each Agent
- Agent 0: 22 + 2 + 83 + 15 + 75 + 49 + 44 + 30 + 37 = 357
- Agent 1: 48 + 41 + 67 + 63 + 88 + 33 + 89 + 23 + 11 = 463
- Agent 2: 78 + 38 + 95 + 56 + 70 + 3 + 76 + 35 + 2 = 453
- Agent 3: 75 + 23 + 23 + 93 + 59 + 11 + 98 + 19 + 34 = 435
- Agent 4: 19 + 26 + 57 + 97 + 38 + 76 + 18 + 12 + 16 = 355
- Agent 5: 80 + 52 + 51 + 24 + 28 + 63 + 58 + 66 + 13 = 435

### Allocation Strategy
To allocate items fairly, we will consider each agent's highest valued items and ensure each agent receives at least one of their top choices, if possible. Ideally, we want to distribute the items so that agents value their allocation highly.

We will start by allocating the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most, and then fill in the remaining allocations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation

1. **Item 2 (value 95 for Agent 2)**: Allocate to Agent 2.
2. **Item 6 (value 98 for Agent 3)**: Allocate to Agent 3.
3. **Item 4 (value 88 for Agent 1)**: Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3 (value 97 for Agent 4)**: Allocate to Agent 4.
5. **Item 5 (value 76 for Agent 4)**: Allocate to Agent 4.
6. **Item 0 (value 80 for Agent 5)**: Allocate to Agent 5.
7. **Item 7 (value 66 for Agent 5)**: Allocate to Agent 5.
8. **Item 1 (value 52 for Agent 5)**: Allocate to Agent 5.
9. **Item 8 (value 37 for Agent 0)**: Allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": [0, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one of their higher valued items, balancing the distribution while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
