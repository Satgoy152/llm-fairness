Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  16  78  23  22  12  85  26  96
1  23  16  21   1  25  68  39   4  45
2   3   4  87  34  53  28  89  70  24
3  70  36  82  16  28  28  48  11  37
4  83  57  79  32  46  98  45  72  73
5  52  70  64  75  76  10  71  21  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, aiming for an envy-free division, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This approach seeks to maximize the product of the utilities of all agents. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Calculate the utility for each agent for each item.
2. Iterate through various allocations to find one that maximizes the product of the utilities (or Nash welfare).

After considering the valuations, here's an allocation that aims to be fair:

- Agent 0 values item 8 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly, but since it's already taken, we'll find other high-value items.
- Agent 5 values item 3 highly.

Based on the above analysis, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [8]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [0, 7]
- Agent 4: [4, 2]
- Agent 5: [3, 1]

This allocation considers each agent's highest value item and tries to balance the distributions to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [4, 2],
    "5": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and attempts to balance the total perceived value among them.
