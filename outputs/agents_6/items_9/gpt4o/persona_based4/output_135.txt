Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12   7  73  19  92  43  29  38  11
1  30  38  79  16  34  60  55  62   1
2  48  69   8  85  12  50   9  28  60
3  12   6  90  52  32   7  98  58  63
4  73  23  94  56   5  68  95  60  65
5  19  26  45  45  77  51  74  82  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We need to take into account each agent's valuation of each item and try to distribute the items in such a way that agents feel they are receiving a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation that tries to balance the items based on the given valuations:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (highest value for Agent 4).
- Assign items 7, 8, 1, and 5 to Agent 5 (since they have relatively balanced high values for these items).

This allocation considers each agent's highest-valued item while trying to distribute the remaining items fairly. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7, 8, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, minimizing envy, and all items are allocated.
