Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  59   4  34  24  49  39  45  91
1  94  86  96  14  31   5  28  74   1
2  31  76  38  93  57  23  26  31  21
3  67  71  90  65  28  56   8  81  98
4  51  34  96  26   7  21  41  51  68
5  91  41  73  15  21  74  86  44  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, it's not possible to allocate an equal number of items to each agent, so some agents will receive more items than others. 

Let's examine the valuation table to determine a fair allocation strategy:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0     14  59   4  34  24  49  39  45  91
1     94  86  96  14  31   5  28  74   1
2     31  76  38  93  57  23  26  31  21
3     67  71  90  65  28  56   8  81  98
4     51  34  96  26   7  21  41  51  68
5     91  41  73  15  21  74  86  44  44
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 8 highly (91), so assign item 8 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 highly (96), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 highly (93), so assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 8 highly (98), but it's already taken. The next best option is item 7 (81), so assign item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 highly (96), but it's already taken. The next best option is item 8 (68), but it's already taken. The next available item is item 6 (41), so assign item 6 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 highly (91), so assign item 0 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 of the 9 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (1, 4, and 5) in a manner that maintains fairness:

7. **Agent 0** can be given item 1 (59), as it is their next highest-valued item.
8. **Agent 1** can be given item 4 (31), as it is the next highest available.
9. **Agent 2** can be given item 5 (23), as it is the next highest available.

This allocation attempts to maintain fairness by considering the next highest valued items and ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0]
}
```
