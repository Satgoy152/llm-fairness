Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  15  54  95  77  13  77  96  81
1  48  36  97  20   6  27  22  27  45
2  76  42  74  62  24  15  89  71  46
3  86   4  44  77  40  46  76  89  60
4  37  17  18  58  89  81   7  95  37
5  25  48  58  47   0  32  60  99  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the distribution is as balanced as possible, considering each agent's valuation of the items. Given the complexity and lack of a single perfect method for achieving envy-freeness, we'll use a heuristic approach to make a reasonable allocation. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.
3. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

### Calculations:
- Agent 0 total value: 541
- Agent 1 total value: 328
- Agent 2 total value: 499
- Agent 3 total value: 522
- Agent 4 total value: 439
- Agent 5 total value: 428

### Allocation:
- Agent 0: Assign items maximizing their total, such as item 3 (95) and item 7 (96).
- Agent 1: Assign items maximizing their value, such as item 2 (97).
- Agent 2: Assign items such as item 6 (89) and item 0 (76).
- Agent 3: Assign items such as item 8 (60) and item 4 (40).
- Agent 4: Assign items such as item 5 (81).
- Agent 5: Assign items such as item 1 (48).

After balancing the allocations, here's a proposed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [8, 4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. This approach may not be perfectly envy-free but attempts to balance the distribution as fairly as possible under the constraints.
