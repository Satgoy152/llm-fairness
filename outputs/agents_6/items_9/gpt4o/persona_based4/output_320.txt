Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  65  94  38  27  84  84  21   2
1  64  25   4  92  93  92  28  40  58
2  31  80  78  63  66  59  52  27  48
3  52  41  86  24  41  37  41  34  71
4  96  14  10  61  87   5  84  94  55
5  41  60  47  78  35  86  54  94  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives and ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent has a fair share according to their valuation and no agent envies another agent's allocation.

To start, let's calculate the total valuation of each agent for all items and then proceed with a fair allocation.

### Step 1: Total Valuation for Each Agent
- **Agent 0**: 46 + 65 + 94 + 38 + 27 + 84 + 84 + 21 + 2 = 461
- **Agent 1**: 64 + 25 + 4 + 92 + 93 + 92 + 28 + 40 + 58 = 496
- **Agent 2**: 31 + 80 + 78 + 63 + 66 + 59 + 52 + 27 + 48 = 504
- **Agent 3**: 52 + 41 + 86 + 24 + 41 + 37 + 41 + 34 + 71 = 427
- **Agent 4**: 96 + 14 + 10 + 61 + 87 + 5 + 84 + 94 + 55 = 506
- **Agent 5**: 41 + 60 + 47 + 78 + 35 + 86 + 54 + 94 + 89 = 584

### Step 2: Allocating Items
We will allocate items iteratively, ensuring a fair distribution based on valuations. We'll start by giving each agent their most valuable available item, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

1. **Agent 4**: Item 0 (value 96)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 (value 93)
3. **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 92)
4. **Agent 0**: Item 2 (value 94)
5. **Agent 5**: Item 5 (value 86)
6. **Agent 3**: Item 8 (value 71)
7. **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 80)
8. **Agent 2**: Item 6 (value 52)
9. **Agent 5**: Item 7 (value 94)

### Step 3: Final Allocation
After ensuring each agent receives at least one item and distributing based on their highest value remaining items, we get the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's valuation while attempting to maintain fairness and minimize envy.
