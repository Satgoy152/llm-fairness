Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62   2  95  46  83  50  93   0  48
1  69  25  35  29  11  74  63   8  22
2  89  31  90  41  54  87  53   8   2
3   6   4  52  13  30  58  41  81  94
4  98  75  65  63  24  17  21  61  95
5  78  67  22  45  93  24  96  37  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation implies that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Considering the valuations given, we can approach this problem by assigning items in a manner that attempts to balance the total value assigned to each agent, while respecting the integer allocation of items:

1. Start by calculating the total valuation each agent places on all items.
2. Attempt to distribute items such that the total value received by each agent is roughly balanced.
3. Adjust the allocation iteratively to ensure that the number of items allocated equals the number of items available.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 62 + 2 + 95 + 46 + 83 + 50 + 93 + 0 + 48 = 479
- Agent 1: 69 + 25 + 35 + 29 + 11 + 74 + 63 + 8 + 22 = 336
- Agent 2: 89 + 31 + 90 + 41 + 54 + 87 + 53 + 8 + 2 = 455
- Agent 3: 6 + 4 + 52 + 13 + 30 + 58 + 41 + 81 + 94 = 379
- Agent 4: 98 + 75 + 65 + 63 + 24 + 17 + 21 + 61 + 95 = 519
- Agent 5: 78 + 67 + 22 + 45 + 93 + 24 + 96 + 37 + 61 = 523

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [2, 6]  (choosing items with high value for agent 0)
- Agent 1: [5, 0]  (choosing items with high value for agent 1)
- Agent 2: [1, 3]  (choosing items with high value for agent 2)
- Agent 3: [8]     (choosing item with high value for agent 3)
- Agent 4: [4, 7]  (choosing items with high value for agent 4)
- Agent 5: []      (agent 5 receives no items)

Check the allocation:
- Total items allocated: 9 (correct)
- Each agent has an allocation, and the distribution attempts to balance high-valued items.

Allocations in json format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": []
}
```
