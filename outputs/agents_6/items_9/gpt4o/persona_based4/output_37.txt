Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  41  77  77  82  69  98  99   4
1  22  66  70  91  59  56   0  60  96
2  86  54  87   7  40  95  51  31  79
3  16  37  84  22   7  60  94  35  96
4   5  35  74  55  19  76  80  78  64
5   0  10  96  65  36  35  17  37  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, which means that each agent should prefer their allocation to that of any other agent. Given the preferences of the agents, we can use a simple allocation heuristic to achieve an envy-free or nearly envy-free distribution of items.

One common approach to achieve this is the "round-robin" allocation method, where each agent in turn selects their most valued remaining item. This approach helps ensure that each agent gets some of their top preferences, potentially reducing envy.

Here's a potential allocation using a variant of this method:

1. Agent 0 is allocated item 6, their highest-valued item.
2. Agent 1 is allocated item 8, their highest-valued item.
3. Agent 2 is allocated item 5, their highest-valued item.
4. Agent 3 is allocated item 2, their highest-valued item.
5. Agent 4 is allocated item 7, their highest-valued item.
6. Agent 5 is allocated item 3, their highest-valued item.

Now, the remaining items are 0, 1, and 4. We continue the allocation process:

7. Agent 0 is allocated item 4, one of their highest remaining valued items.
8. Agent 1 is allocated item 0, one of their highest remaining valued items.
9. Agent 2 is allocated item 1, one of their highest remaining valued items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some of their most valued items, thereby reducing potential envy.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [8, 0],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 9 items to the 6 agents, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and it tries to balance the allocations based on the agents' valuations to minimize envy.
