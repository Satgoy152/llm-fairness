Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  49  25  32  84  58  82  82  56
1  23  82  70  47  27   7  21  74  48
2   2  99   3  88  22  55  98  88  57
3  61  20  11  16   0  24   5  49  54
4  22  66  36  85   4   0  49  17  89
5   9  64  67  25  46  60  97  58  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is as envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, minimizing envy among agents. Given the matrix of valuations, we can try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the perceived value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

One approach is to use an algorithm that iteratively assigns items to agents based on their highest remaining valuation, trying to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 4 the most (84), so we assign item 4 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1** has their highest valuation for item 1 (82), so item 1 goes to agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 6 the most (98), so item 6 is assigned to agent 2.
- **Agent 3** doesn't have a high valuation, but we can give them item 8 (54), which they value the most among remaining options.
- **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest (85), so item 3 goes to agent 4.
- **Agent 5** values item 2 the most (67), so item 2 is assigned to agent 5.

After the first pass, we have assigned items: 4, 1, 6, 8, 3, and 2. We need to assign the remaining items (0, 5, 7) in a way that balances the total allocations.

Let's continue:

- **Agent 0** can receive item 0 (51), which is the next highest remaining value for any agent.
- **Agent 2** can take item 7 (88), which they value highly.
- **Agent 5** can take item 5 (60), which balances the distribution.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
