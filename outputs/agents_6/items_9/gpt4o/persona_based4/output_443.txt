Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  99   3  36  84   6  21  73  40
1  67  11  61  74  46  86  95  56   4
2   7  77  97   0  66  90  60  97  80
3   8  17  98  87  10   7  59  47  35
4  30   1  15  86  90  37  57  64  85
5   2  52  93  77   8  91  20   4  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where possible. This means each agent should feel that they received a fair share, given their valuations.

Based on the given valuations, we can distribute the items as follows:

1. Agent 0: Prioritize high-value items for agent 0, such as item 1 (99) and item 4 (84).
2. Agent 1: Consider items with high value for agent 1, like item 6 (95) and item 5 (86).
3. Agent 2: Allocate items with high value for agent 2, such as item 2 (97) and item 7 (97).
4. Agent 3: Assign items that agent 3 values highly, like item 3 (87) and item 8 (35).
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 4 (90) and item 8 (85) as they have high value for agent 4.
6. Agent 5: Consider items with high value for agent 5, such as item 5 (91) and item 2 (93).

The constraint is to allocate a total of 9 items, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1]
- Agent 1: Items [6]
- Agent 2: Items [2]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 8]
- Agent 5: Items [5, 0, 7]

Now, let me present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 8],
    "5": [5, 0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents according to their preferences while considering an envy-free approach as much as possible.
