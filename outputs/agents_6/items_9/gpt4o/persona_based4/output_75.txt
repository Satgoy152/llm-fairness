Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  65  73  75  41   6  22   4   2
1  53  26  70  92  59  96  19  63  20
2  67  76  69  27  30  21  88  32  80
3  22  51  86  37  75  16  25  92  26
4  29  98  49  60  53  79  95  94  66
5  95  40  18  26  34  78   7  44  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's preferences and attempt to maximize fairness. A widely recognized method for such a problem is the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that is still available.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** starts and picks item 3 (valuation 75).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 5 (valuation 96).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 6 (valuation 88).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 7 (valuation 92).
5. **Agent 4** picks item 1 (valuation 98).
6. **Agent 5** picks item 0 (valuation 95).
7. **Agent 0** picks item 2 (valuation 73).
8. **Agent 1** picks item 4 (valuation 59).
9. **Agent 2** picks item 8 (valuation 80).

This allocation allows each agent to receive items based on their preferences. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 6 agents, considering each agent's highest preferences with the available items in a fair manner.
