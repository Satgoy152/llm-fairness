Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  30  36  54  91  98  41  89  70
1  20  44   9   7  39  65   0  57  22
2  79  19  48  96  80  57  24  34  10
3  78  81  62  76  12  19  80  39  39
4  22  11  10  10  12  18  50  52  69
5  49  27  35  42  69  13  27  46  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the envy-freeness principle, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocated items at least as much as the items allocated to any other agent, if possible. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we'll aim to create an allocation that is as fair as possible under the circumstances.

To do this, we'll try to distribute the items in a way that balances the total valuations each agent receives. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items.
2. Allocate items sequentially, starting with the items with the highest total valuation across all agents, to the agent who values them the highest.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this method:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

- **Item 4:** Highest total valuation (403) - Allocate to Agent 0 (value 91).
- **Item 3:** Second highest total valuation (285) - Allocate to Agent 2 (value 96).
- **Item 5:** Third highest total valuation (270) - Allocate to Agent 1 (value 65).
- **Item 1:** Fourth highest total valuation (212) - Allocate to Agent 3 (value 81).
- **Item 8:** Fifth highest total valuation (271) - Allocate to Agent 0 (value 70).
- **Item 0:** Sixth highest total valuation (255) - Allocate to Agent 2 (value 79).
- **Item 6:** Seventh highest total valuation (222) - Allocate to Agent 3 (value 80).
- **Item 7:** Eighth highest total valuation (317) - Allocate to Agent 0 (value 89).
- **Item 2:** Ninth highest total valuation (200) - Allocate to Agent 0 (value 36).

### Resulting Allocations:

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```

Note: This method attempts to balance the distribution of items based on each agent's valuation, but perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable without a more complex algorithm or additional items. However, the allocation is designed to minimize potential envy given the constraints.
