Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  15  92  44  90  10  49  12  79
1  78  81  75  35  54  34  42  92  95
2   1  49  66  36  84  85  77  77  87
3  48  54  13  72  90  68  93  36  60
4  72  65  25  85  87   5  38  99   0
5  55  27  64  58  61  93  81  76  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we can try to maximize each agent's total value based on their individual valuations. We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
2. Adjust allocations if necessary to balance the distribution and ensure envy-freeness.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 0 (92, 62)
- Agent 1: Items 8, 1 (95, 81)
- Agent 2: Items 5, 4 (85, 84)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (93)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (99)
- Agent 5: Item 3 (58)

Now let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [8, 1],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and it attempts to allocate items based on the highest valuations to minimize envy among agents.
