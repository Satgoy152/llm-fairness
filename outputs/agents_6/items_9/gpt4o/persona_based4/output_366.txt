Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  48  39  69  20  94  73  21  46
1  25  38  99  13  84  34  61  73  91
2  86  87  18  99  94  19  49  89  31
3  72  21  23  57  37  57  76  66  70
4  71  81  86  36  72  94  47  47  25
5  23  53  83  60  97  90   5  81  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. However, given the discrete nature of items and integer constraints, achieving perfect envy-freeness might be challenging, but we will strive to get close.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Total Valuation Calculation**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. **Average Share**: Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally receive around 1.5 items. However, allocations must be integers, so we aim to distribute such that the total value is balanced.
3. **Greedy Allocation**: Assign items to agents who value them the most while ensuring we aim for fairness.
4. **Adjustments**: If any agent has more than 2 items or none, try to redistribute to balance the allocations.

Let's compute this step-by-step:

1. **Total Valuations**:
   - Agent 0: 71 + 48 + 39 + 69 + 20 + 94 + 73 + 21 + 46 = 481
   - Agent 1: 25 + 38 + 99 + 13 + 84 + 34 + 61 + 73 + 91 = 518
   - Agent 2: 86 + 87 + 18 + 99 + 94 + 19 + 49 + 89 + 31 = 572
   - Agent 3: 72 + 21 + 23 + 57 + 37 + 57 + 76 + 66 + 70 = 479
   - Agent 4: 71 + 81 + 86 + 36 + 72 + 94 + 47 + 47 + 25 = 559
   - Agent 5: 23 + 53 + 83 + 60 + 97 + 90 + 5 + 81 + 50 = 542

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Allocate items starting with the highest valued items for each agent.

   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it 86, Agent 2 gets it.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it 87, Agent 2 gets it.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it 99, Agent 1 gets it.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it 99, Agent 2 gets it.
   - Item 4: Agent 5 values it 97, Agent 5 gets it.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it 94, Agent 0 gets it.
   - Item 6: Agent 3 values it 76, Agent 3 gets it.
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it 89, Agent 2 gets it.
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it 91, Agent 1 gets it.

3. **Adjustments**: Ensure no agent has more than 2 items and redistribute if necessary.

   - Agent 2 has 4 items (0, 1, 3, 7). We need to redistribute.
   - Agent 1 has 2 items (2, 8), Agent 0 has 1 item (5), Agent 5 has 1 item (4), Agent 3 has 1 item (6).
   - Possible redistribution: Give item 1 to Agent 4 and item 3 to Agent 0.

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: [3, 5]
- Agent 1: [2, 8]
- Agent 2: [0, 7]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [4]

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```
