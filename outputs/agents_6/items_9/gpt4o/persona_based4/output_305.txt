Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14   7  90  82  20  54  70   7  71
1  31  58  75  53  35  37  43  25  66
2  52  36   1  24  86  40  10  22  74
3  34  85  10  49  35  12  87  47  89
4  14  41  93  69  74  74  97   3  33
5  71  14  73  62  91  74  27  10  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to maximize the perceived value each agent gets while balancing the total allocation. Let's follow a systematic approach using the valuations provided:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: First, we identify which items are valued the highest by each agent. This helps us prioritize allocations that maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Allocate Items**: We'll assign items based on maximizing each agent's total perceived value while ensuring each item is only allocated once.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If necessary, adjust allocations to ensure perceived fairness by comparing total values and reallocating items where it improves fairness without creating envy.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- **Agent 0** sees the highest value in item 2 (90) and item 3 (82).
- **Agent 1** values item 2 (75) and item 8 (66) highly.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 (86) and item 8 (74) highly.
- **Agent 3** values item 8 (89) and item 1 (85) highly.
- **Agent 4** values item 6 (97) and item 2 (93) highly.
- **Agent 5** values item 8 (99) and item 4 (91) highly.

**Initial Allocations:**
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 5.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

**Remaining Items**: 0, 3, 5, 7

**Distribute Remaining Items to Balance Values:**
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (highest remaining value for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 5 (second highest remaining value).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 4 (to increase total value).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (to improve fairness).

**Final Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 5],
    "5": [8, 0]
}
```
This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives items they value highly while distributing the total perceived value fairly across all agents.
