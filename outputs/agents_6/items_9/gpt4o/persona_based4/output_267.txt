Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  62  36   1  46  31  79  97  74
1  30  51  64  93  40  39  18  49  57
2  77  88  18  10   2  32  19   6  17
3  88  64  79  35  39  66  74  76  39
4  17   0  71   4  91  83  70  43  46
5  53  92  44  61  36  11  60  51   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, a common approach is to aim for an "envy-free" allocation as much as possible. This means that each agent should be at least as happy with their allocation as they would be with any other agent's allocation, given their own valuations.

We'll start by attempting to allocate the items such that each agent gets approximately the same total value according to their own valuations. This will help in achieving a fair division in terms of individual preferences.

Let's consider the following heuristic approach for allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Attempt to distribute items so that the total value of items assigned to each agent is balanced.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 29 + 62 + 36 + 1 + 46 + 31 + 79 + 97 + 74 = 455
   - Agent 1: 30 + 51 + 64 + 93 + 40 + 39 + 18 + 49 + 57 = 441
   - Agent 2: 77 + 88 + 18 + 10 + 2 + 32 + 19 + 6 + 17 = 269
   - Agent 3: 88 + 64 + 79 + 35 + 39 + 66 + 74 + 76 + 39 = 560
   - Agent 4: 17 + 0 + 71 + 4 + 91 + 83 + 70 + 43 + 46 = 425
   - Agent 5: 53 + 92 + 44 + 61 + 36 + 11 + 60 + 51 + 8 = 416

2. Sort items by value for each agent and allocate items trying to balance the total value.

Here's a proposed allocation based on the above calculations and attempting to balance total value:

- Agent 0: [7, 6]
- Agent 1: [3, 2]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [0, 8]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [5]

This allocation aims to balance the total perceived value for each agent, trying to minimize envy.

Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation should distribute all 9 items across the agents while considering their valuations to achieve a fair division.
