Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  39  39  82  32  32  41  91  87
1  79  60  55   5  67  49  16  15  26
2  54  27  70  46  61  81   3  47  49
3  26  70  30   5  56  90  15  41  41
4  46  14  20  93  66  42  11   1  37
5  33  40  11  63  46  84  51   0  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring envy-freeness to a reasonable extent. Given the valuations, a common method is to use algorithms like the envy-free cake-cutting or adjusted winner procedures, but since we need a discrete allocation, we can attempt a simple greedy allocation that tries to balance the value each agent receives.

Let's summarize the process:

1. **Calculate the total value for each agent**: Sum up each agent’s valuations for all items.
2. **Assign items greedily**: Start by assigning the item that an agent values the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. **Balance the allocation**: Adjust the allocation to avoid envy and ensure fairness.

We can proceed with assigning items to agents based on the highest individual valuations and adjusting to ensure fairness.

Here’s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 7 the most (91). Assign item 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the most (79). Assign item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the most (81). Assign item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the most (90), but it's taken. Next, values item 1 the most (70). Assign item 1.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 the most (93). Assign item 3.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 8 the most (89). Assign item 8.

Now, we have assigned 6 out of 9 items. We need to assign the remaining 3 items (2, 4, 6) in a way that maintains fairness.

7. **Assign item 4 to Agent 0**: As Agent 0 has only one item so far.
8. **Assign item 2 to Agent 1**: As Agent 1 also has only one item so far.
9. **Assign item 6 to Agent 3**: As Agent 3 also has only one item so far.

This allocation aims to ensure each agent gets at least one item and attempts to balance the total value received by each agent.

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8]
}
```

This allocation respects the condition of distributing all 9 items among the 6 agents.
