Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  58  74  99  73  54  32   3  98
1  73  32  21  21   8  59  53  29  97
2  40  85  33  39  67  44  86  36  23
3  67  52  51   7  42  88  88  18  73
4  96  92  99  82  27  38  43  15  93
5  80  11  74  29  62  23  99  89   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the valuations. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations provided, we'll attempt to allocate the items in a manner that maximizes each agent's satisfaction according to their own valuations. A simple approach is to allocate items iteratively by valuing each item according to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (99). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 8 (97). Assign item 8 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the highest (86). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values items 5 and 6 equally (88), but since item 6 is taken, assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 the highest (99). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 6 the highest (99), but this item is already taken. The next highest is item 7 (89). Assign item 7 to Agent 5.

Now, each agent has one item. We have 3 items left: 0, 1, and 4. We continue allocating these remaining items:

7. **Agent 4** values item 0 the highest (96) among the remaining items. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
8. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (67) among the remaining items. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
9. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (58) among the remaining items. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

After this allocation, all 9 items are distributed among the agents. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 0],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on maximizing the individual valuations of the items.
