Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  11  58  65  88  54  65  82  27
1  90   9  94  53   1   7  50  37  77
2  39  50  50  91  60  24  97  25  98
3   5  69  37  90  64  64  81  15  99
4  20  19  74  45  60  36  73  32  68
5  37  85  69  40  73   3  45  36  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. Given that the total number of items is 9, and there are 6 agents, each agent should ideally receive 1 or 2 items to maintain fairness. We will strive to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is relatively balanced. 

Let's evaluate and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Items 4 (88), 3 (65), 6 (65)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations: Items 0 (90), 2 (94), 8 (77)
   - Allocate items 0, 2 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations: Items 6 (97), 8 (98), 3 (91)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - High valuations: Items 8 (99), 3 (90)
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - High valuations: Items 2 (74), 6 (73)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - High valuations: Items 1 (85), 4 (73)
   - Allocate items 1, 5 to Agent 5

Now, let's check the allocations to ensure they are fair and all items are distributed:

- Agent 0 gets item 4
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 2
- Agent 2 gets item 3
- Agent 3 gets item 8
- Agent 4 gets item 6
- Agent 5 gets items 1, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```
