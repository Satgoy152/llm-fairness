Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  50  84  52  96  15  98  73  31
1  75  73  95  23   0  68  76  14  33
2  77  64  40  32  72  14  63  99  87
3  17  33  36  60   5  22  73  78  85
4  61  34  87  87  88  75  68  34   1
5  80  71  58  17  88  42  48  68  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a heuristic approach that aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations.

One approach is to iteratively assign items to agents based on maximizing the minimum value received or reducing envy. We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 6 and 8.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 7.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets item 0.

Now, in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total perceived value across all agents, though achieving perfect envy-freeness with discrete items is often challenging. Each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.
