Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  13  73  35  20  63  46  26  12
1  23  54  86  94  39  30  63  10  90
2  94   7  32   7  71  92  43  65  43
3  83  70  47  34  96  40  46  18  62
4  14  39  68  58  44  34  42  10  50
5  92  72  72  35  63  23  25  73  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents using the concept of envy-freeness, we aim to assign items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. The goal is to minimize envy, where no agent prefers another's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: For each agent, sum up their valuations of all items to understand their overall preference scale.

2. **Proportional Fairness**: Allocate items in a way that each agent receives a proportion of the total value that is roughly equal.

3. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating the most valued items to each agent based on their preferences.

4. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**: If any agent envies another's allocation (i.e., they prefer another agent's set of items more than their own), adjust the allocation to minimize or eliminate this envy.

5. **Ensure Each Agent Gets at Least One Item**: If possible, ensure that each agent gets at least one item to maintain integer distribution.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 2 (73), item 0 (46), and item 5 (63).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 3 (94), item 8 (90), and item 2 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 0 (94), item 5 (92), and item 4 (71).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 4 (96), item 0 (83), and item 1 (70).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 2 (68), item 3 (58), and item 4 (44).
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers item 0 (92), item 8 (75), and item 1 (72).

### Fair Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 8]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 5]
- **Agent 3**: [4]
- **Agent 4**: [1]
- **Agent 5**: [6, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items totaling their highest preferences while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is fairly balanced.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation strives to be envy-free and proportional, considering the preferences and total valuations of all agents.
