Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  37  94  47  79  95  16  33  38
1   4  90  58  54   3  59  16  66  87
2  71  32  57  19  37  23  79  61  70
3  57  50  92  19  32  68  38  66  54
4  83  36  34  61   2  20  82  42  64
5  81  62  79  95  18  28   6  34  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method that balances the total value each agent receives. Given the valuations, we should aim to maximize the perceived fairness by each agent, ideally ensuring that each agent perceives they are receiving a fair share compared to others.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 15 + 37 + 94 + 47 + 79 + 95 + 16 + 33 + 38 = 454
- Agent 1: 4 + 90 + 58 + 54 + 3 + 59 + 16 + 66 + 87 = 437
- Agent 2: 71 + 32 + 57 + 19 + 37 + 23 + 79 + 61 + 70 = 449
- Agent 3: 57 + 50 + 92 + 19 + 32 + 68 + 38 + 66 + 54 = 476
- Agent 4: 83 + 36 + 34 + 61 + 2 + 20 + 82 + 42 + 64 = 424
- Agent 5: 81 + 62 + 79 + 95 + 18 + 28 + 6 + 34 + 25 = 428

Next, we can allocate items to balance the total value as evenly as possible:

1. Allocate the item to the agent who values it the most, one by one.
2. Check the total value each agent has received and attempt to minimize the difference.

Based on this strategy, here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [2, 5]
  - Total value: 94 + 95 = 189
- Agent 1 gets items: [1, 8]
  - Total value: 90 + 87 = 177
- Agent 2 gets items: [6]
  - Total value: 79
- Agent 3 gets items: [0]
  - Total value: 57
- Agent 4 gets items: [7]
  - Total value: 42
- Agent 5 gets items: [3, 4]
  - Total value: 95 + 18 = 113

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned only once, and the agents receive a roughly fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```
