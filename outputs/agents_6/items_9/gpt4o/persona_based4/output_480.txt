Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  28  94  70   8  55  60  13  16
1  12  36  94  65  70  92  93  18   8
2  44  32  50  15  34   8  81  61  57
3  48  49  78   5  53  83  43  28  52
4  28  25  52  52  87   2  46  63   3
5  26   7   4  30  96  25  48  17  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, while taking into account envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use an approach based on maximizing the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's consider the valuations and attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Identify each agent's highest-valued items** and allocate them if possible, ensuring no conflict arises. 

2. **Assign remaining items** by considering the next highest-valued items for each agent, again avoiding conflicts and trying to balance the total value received by each agent.

3. If necessary, use a **round-robin approach** to allocate any unallocated items, prioritizing agents with the least total value received so far.

Let's proceed with this method:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (94).
- Agent 1 also highly values item 2, but it’s already considered for agent 0. Agent 1 highly values item 5 (92).
- Agent 2 values item 6 (81) the most.
- Agent 3 values item 5 (83), but it’s already considered for agent 1. Agent 3 values item 2 (78), but it’s considered for agent 0. Next best for agent 3 is item 4 (53).
- Agent 4 values item 4 (87), but it’s already considered for agent 3. Agent 4 next highly values item 7 (63).
- Agent 5 values item 4 (96), but it’s already considered. Next is item 0 (26).

Now let's finalize the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** [2] (valued 94)
2. **Agent 1:** [5] (valued 92)
3. **Agent 2:** [6] (valued 81)
4. **Agent 3:** [4] (valued 53)
5. **Agent 4:** [7] (valued 63)
6. **Agent 5:** [0]

The remaining items to allocate are 1, 3, and 8.

Continuing with allocations:

- Allocate item 1 to agent 2 (next best value 32).
- Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (next best value 70).
- Allocate item 8 to agent 4 (next best value 3).

This gives the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7, 8],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and ensures each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.
