Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17   7  41  13  66  67  21  77  72
1  21  10  40  77   8  59  10  83  69
2   1  77  47  23  44  87  11  33  30
3  80  74  83  74   9  65  14   0  18
4  76  12  82  35  71  41  86   1  51
5   5  21  38  34  15  38  50  94  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can employ a method such as the "greedy" round-robin method, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued unallocated item until all items are allocated. However, given the complexity of ensuring absolute envy-freeness, we aim to minimize envy as much as possible through this heuristic approach.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

**Round 1:**
- Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 77)
- Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 77)
- Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 87)
- Agent 3 picks item 2 (value 83)
- Agent 4 picks item 6 (value 86)
- Agent 5 picks item 7 but it's already taken, so picks item 8 (value 94)

**Round 2:**
- Agent 0 picks item 8 (value 72)
- Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 8) since higher valued items are taken
- Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 77)
- Agent 3 picks item 0 (value 80)
- Agent 4 picks item 4 but it's taken, so picks item 2 (value 82)
- Agent 5 picks item 5 (value 38)

**Remaining Items:**
- Items left: 0, 1, 3, 6
- These items are further distributed to balance allocations.

Now distributing the remaining items:

- Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 17)
- Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 10)
- Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 23)
- Agent 3 picks item 1 (value 74)
- Agent 4 picks no additional item
- Agent 5 picks no additional item

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8, 0],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [5, 1, 3],
    "3": [2, 0, 1],
    "4": [6, 2],
    "5": [8, 5]
}
```

Note: The allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed, aiming to minimize envy, but absolute envy-freeness may not be achieved due to the nature of discrete allocation and valuation differences.
