Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  86  67  84  80   2  58  87   3
1   2  17  40  69  99  13  49  70  84
2  80  97  10  14  87  85  55  93  34
3  85  93  64  75  54  34  47  84  60
4  25   5  40  67  68  70  99  42  21
5  89  54  70  30  38  16  31  38  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use an approach that tries to maximize each agent's total utility from the items they receive while also ensuring that no agent envies another. One common strategy is to use a round-robin allocation where each agent, in turn, picks their most valued item from the remaining items. Given the valuations, we will proceed with this approach.

Let's start by allocating items one by one, keeping track of each agent's most valued available item.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 7 (value 87) and 1 (value 86).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 4 (value 99).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 1 (value 97).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 0 (value 85).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 6 (value 99).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Highest value item is 0 (value 89), but it is taken. Next is item 2 (value 70).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 5.

Continuing with the second round of allocations:

7. **Agent 0**: Next highest value items are 3 (value 84).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

8. **Agent 1**: Next highest value item is 8 (value 84).
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.

9. **Agent 2**: Next highest value item is 5 (value 85).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now all items have been allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2]
}
```
