Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  42  84  26  36   2  10   8  92
1  11  91  75  71  11  51  64  76  98
2  84  86  63  72  77  25  13  85  60
3  37  14  22  45  98  64  98  36  68
4   4  39   2  16  68  99  35  47  52
5  48  96  69  90   3  28  19  30  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a manner that minimizes envy, we will aim for each agent to receive items that they value highly, ensuring an envy-free allocation as far as possible. The problem is analogous to the "cake-cutting" problem where each agent should feel that their allocation is the best or at least as good as others'.

Given the valuations matrix, let's use the following strategy for the allocation:

1. Each agent should ideally receive an item they value highly.
2. We will try to ensure that each agent's total valuation from their allocated items is as balanced as possible compared to others.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0** values item 8 the most (value 92).
- **Agent 1** values item 8 the most (value 98), but since Agent 0 has already received it, we will allocate their next highest valued item which is item 1 (value 91).
- **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (value 86), but since it has been allocated, we allocate their next highest valued item which is item 7 (value 85).
- **Agent 3** values item 4 the most (value 98).
- **Agent 4** values item 5 the most (value 99).
- **Agent 5** values item 1 the most (value 96), but since it has been allocated, we allocate their next highest valued item which is item 3 (value 90).

This takes care of the highest value items. Now we allocate the remaining items:

- **Items 0, 2, and 6** are left. We allocate these to the agents who have the least total value so far, ensuring each allocation improves fairness:
  - Allocate item 2 to **Agent 3** (value 22).
  - Allocate item 0 to **Agent 5** (value 48).
  - Allocate item 6 to **Agent 4** (value 35).

After this allocation, each agent has been assigned a set of items that maximizes their individual valuations given the constraints.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4, 2],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation seeks to minimize envy and distribute items based on each agent's preferences as evenly as possible.
