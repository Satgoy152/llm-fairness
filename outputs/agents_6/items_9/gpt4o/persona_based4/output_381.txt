Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  90  23  39  81  63  90  56  34
1  33  96   0  45  76  20  47  98  78
2  70  32  45  85  46   3  89  24  94
3  18  58  93  35  81   2  77  78  77
4  71  87  59  30  22  68  54  89  57
5  43  93  29  42   7  39  93  11  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility, which is a common strategy in fair division problems to ensure envy-freeness or at least approximate envy-freeness. Given the valuations table, I will proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0. Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 6. Thus, we allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 7. We allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values items 3 and 8. We allocate these items to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 2. We allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 highly values item 0. We allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 highly values item 5. We allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

After these allocations, we have 3, 4, and 8 left unallocated. We can assign these to the agents based on their next highest valuations while ensuring each agent has at least one item and striving to maintain balance.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values 4 higher than others among the remaining).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values 3 highly, and it is already allocated to Agent 2).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 4 (Agent 4 values 8 next after item 0).

The allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, maximizing their valuations as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
