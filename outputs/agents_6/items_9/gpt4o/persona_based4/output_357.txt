Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74   3  59   2  77   4  11  93  34
1  47  52  10  41  22   2   1  70  58
2  49  82  79  59  49  66  64  20  67
3  49   1  49  35  68  38  43  93  90
4  22  35   6  99  27  21  62   6  53
5  48  87  83  60  22  33   0  32  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 9 items among the 6 agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent's allocation maximizes their valuation given the constraints. Let's attempt to fairly distribute the items by considering the preferences of each agent.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are 4 (77), 7 (93), and 0 (74). Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value items for Agent 1 are 1 (52), 8 (58), and 7 (70). Since item 7 is already taken, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value items for Agent 2 are 1 (82), 2 (79), and 8 (67). Since item 1 is taken, allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value items for Agent 3 are 7 (93), 8 (90), and 4 (68). Since items 7 and 8 are taken, allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value items for Agent 4 are 3 (99), 8 (53), and 4 (27). Since items 8 and 4 are taken, allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value items for Agent 5 are 1 (87), 2 (83), and 3 (60). Since items 1, 2, and 3 are taken, allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Revisiting the allocation:
- Agent 0 has item 7, add item 0 (74) to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has item 1.
- Agent 2 has item 2.
- Agent 3 has item 4.
- Agent 4 has item 3.
- Agent 5 has item 5.

Remaining items to allocate: 6 and 8. Let's allocate these based on maximizing the next highest value:
- Item 8 (highest remaining value for Agent 3, 90) goes to Agent 3.
- Item 6 (0 valued for Agent 5, but highest remaining for Agent 3, 43) goes to Agent 0 (next highest, 11).

After allocation, we have:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation considers maximizing each agent's valuation while fairly distributing the items.
