Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  48  67  48  15  22  96  85  40
1  99  90  73  68  87  66   1  87  25
2  22  42  65  36  94  97  80  32  32
3  89  66  26   3  52  79  21  10  13
4  91  49   0  10  41  53  66  27  76
5  70   9  59  90   4  92   3  76   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to minimize envy among agents by distributing the items such that each agent believes they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

1. **Agent Valuation Summary**:
   - Agent 0: High values for items 6 and 7.
   - Agent 1: High values for items 0, 1, 4, and 7.
   - Agent 2: High values for items 4, 5, and 6.
   - Agent 3: High values for items 0 and 5.
   - Agent 4: High value for item 0.
   - Agent 5: High values for items 3 and 5.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent.
   - Attempt to balance the total value each agent receives as per their own valuation.

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (value 99), next highest is Agent 4 (value 91).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (value 90), next highest is Agent 0 (value 48).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (value 67), next highest is Agent 2 (value 65).
   - Item 3: Agent 5 (value 90), next highest is Agent 0 (value 48).
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (value 94), next highest is Agent 1 (value 87).
   - Item 5: Agent 5 (value 92), next highest is Agent 2 (value 97).
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (value 96), next highest is Agent 2 (value 80).
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (value 85), next highest is Agent 1 (value 87).
   - Item 8: Agent 4 (value 76), next highest is Agent 0 (value 40).

4. **Adjustments for Fairness**:
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
   - Items can be reallocated to balance total perceived value.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [2, 6, 7] (high values on these items)
   - Agent 1: [0, 1] (receives high-value items)
   - Agent 2: [4] (high value on item 4)
   - Agent 3: [] (no items allocated due to lower value preferences compared to others)
   - Agent 4: [8] (receives high-value item)
   - Agent 5: [3, 5] (receives high-value items)

Here is the final allocation presented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```
