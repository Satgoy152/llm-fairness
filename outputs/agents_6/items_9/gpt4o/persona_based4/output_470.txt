Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27   5  11   8  26  38  99  90  45
1  27  10  73  72  40  32  28  37  29
2  39  58  26  79  54  21  24  46  11
3  41  59  93  47  35  44  56  91  88
4  83  17  91  44  80  23  74  88  43
5  45  51   7  69  74  69  18  10  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider an allocation method that ensures envy-freeness as much as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation of any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations, one common approach is to use a round-robin or a bidding procedure to allocate items based on preferences. However, since this is a small problem, we can manually check possible allocations to minimize envy.

Here's an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 highly, so it makes sense to allocate item 6 to them.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2, so we give them item 2.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most, allocate item 3 to them.
4. **Agent 3** has high value for item 1, assign item 1 to them.
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the most, allocate item 0 to them.
6. **Agent 5** values item 4 and 3 equally, but item 3 is already allocated, so we give them item 4.

With these allocations, let's distribute the remaining items:
- **Agent 0** has item 6, let's give them item 7 as they have a high valuation for it.
- **Agent 1** has item 2, item 5 is the next highest value for them, so give them item 5.
- **Agent 2** has item 3, let's give them item 8 as they have the next highest valuation for it.

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [6, 7]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 8]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [4]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item they value highly, reducing overall envy. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation uses all 9 items and assigns them to the agents based on their highest valuations, aiming for a fair distribution.
