Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  47  55  13   1  66  65  20  44
1   0  76  72  70  68  29  86  44  69
2   3  87   4  48  97  15  25  90  37
3  78  80   8  83  88  43  51  67  84
4  35   2  42  59  49  90  15  47   9
5   2  12   5  46  84  44   4  85  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, it's important to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of any other agent over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve an allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value items** for each agent and try to allocate those, ensuring no other agent highly values the same item more than their own highest value item.

2. **Check for envy-freeness** by ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

3. **Adjust allocations** by swapping items or changing allocations to eliminate envy if it exists.

4. **Ensure all items are allocated** and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Based on the valuations provided in the table, let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (66) and item 6 (65), so we can allocate those to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 6 (86), but since it's already allocated, allocate item 1 (76) and item 2 (72) to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 (97), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 4 (88), but since it's allocated, allocate item 3 (83).
- Agent 4 highly values item 5 (90), which is allocated, so allocate item 3 (59) and item 7 (47) to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 highly values item 7 (85) and item 8 (79), so allocate item 8 to Agent 5.

After allocating based on the above considerations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item while maintaining fairness and envy-freeness as much as possible:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0, 8]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items according to their preferences, while ensuring all 9 items are distributed among the 6 agents.
