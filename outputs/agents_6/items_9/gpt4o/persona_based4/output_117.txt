Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  82  25  20  66  39  86  47  26
1  96  24  18  90   9   1  75  51  21
2  84   2  73  56  45  11  99  69  74
3  25  66  59  11  82  65   9  64  13
4  87  14  35  44  79  68  78  77   3
5  53  32  21   3  70  84   7  81  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as anyone else's allocation. Here's a strategy to achieve this:

1. Compute the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items in such a way that tries to balance the perceived value among all agents.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 55 + 82 + 25 + 20 + 66 + 39 + 86 + 47 + 26 = 446
- Agent 1: 96 + 24 + 18 + 90 + 9 + 1 + 75 + 51 + 21 = 385
- Agent 2: 84 + 2 + 73 + 56 + 45 + 11 + 99 + 69 + 74 = 513
- Agent 3: 25 + 66 + 59 + 11 + 82 + 65 + 9 + 64 + 13 = 394
- Agent 4: 87 + 14 + 35 + 44 + 79 + 68 + 78 + 77 + 3 = 485
- Agent 5: 53 + 32 + 21 + 3 + 70 + 84 + 7 + 81 + 40 = 391

Next, let's try to allocate items to balance the perceived value:

- Agent 0 values item 6 highly (86), so allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (96), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly, but it's already allocated; the next highest is item 2 (73), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly (82), so allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly, but it's already allocated; the next highest is item 7 (77), so allocate item 7 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly (84), so allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 1, 3, 8
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highly (82).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it highly (90).
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it highly (74).

Resulting allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [2, 8]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [7]
- Agent 5: [5]

Finally, here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```
