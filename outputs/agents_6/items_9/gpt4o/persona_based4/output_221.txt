Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  48  39  90   1  45  50  86   0
1  80  34   5  20  93  40  90  25  96
2  73  57  71   6  14  15  64  77  90
3   1  88   6  15  58  15   5   2   8
4  22  35  97  20  54   0  11  41  88
5   3  89  63   8  92  48  74   4  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for a division that minimizes envy. However, it's important to note that achieving a perfectly envy-free allocation is not always possible in discrete settings with integral allocations.

Given the valuations, let's attempt to allocate the items such that we balance the total value each agent receives.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 3 (90), 7 (86) 
   - Allocate: 3, 7

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 8 (96), 4 (93)
   - Allocate: 8, 4

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 8 (90), 0 (73)
   - Allocate: 0

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (88)
   - Allocate: 1

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (97)
   - Allocate: 2

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (89), 6 (74)
   - Allocate: 6, 5

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [8, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the highest individual valuations while distributing the items as fairly as possible among the agents. Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.
