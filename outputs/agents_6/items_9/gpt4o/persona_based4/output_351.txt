Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  78  36   5  47  20   8  23  58
1  62  20  55  60  68  67  76  29  57
2  48  94  88  30  61  69  45  75   5
3  86  83  98  71  37  23  75  59  11
4  76  47  52  42  15  50  39   1  61
5  22  59  26   5  52  78  53  98  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the 6 agents such that the allocation is fair and each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use strategies from fair division theory. One approach is to aim for an "envy-free" allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible items is often not possible, so we aim for a fair division that minimizes envy.

Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, at least 3 agents will receive 2 items each and the others will receive 1 item each. To proceed, we focus on maximizing the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Initial Allocation:** Start by allocating the highest valued item to each agent, as this will immediately reduce potential envy.
2. **Remaining Items:** Allocate remaining items to agents who have the highest additional valuation for them, ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item.

Let's calculate a possible allocation based on this approach:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valued item is item 1 (78).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valued item is item 6 (76).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valued item is item 1 (94) but already taken, next highest is item 2 (88).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valued item is item 2 (98) but already taken, next highest is item 0 (86).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valued item is item 0 (76) but already taken, next highest is item 8 (61).
6. **Agent 5:** Highest valued item is item 7 (98).

After initial allocation, remaining items are: 3, 4, 5.

Let's allocate these remaining items based on maximizing the marginal value for agents that received only one item:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 1, next highest value is item 0 (76) - already taken, next is item 4 (47).
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 6, next highest value is item 4 (68).
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 0, next highest is item 7 (59) - already taken, next is item 5 (23).

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [7, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with consideration given to each agent's valuations to minimize envy.
