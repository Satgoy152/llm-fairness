Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  64  83  54  77  86  79  73  33
1  15  16  65  62  41  88  12  72  22
2  29  33   4  34  30   1  13  50  36
3  87  44  70  10  17  84  92   3  78
4  50   2  34  46  70   1  28  55   5
5  47  11  95  23  56   0  74  12  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a method like the draft mechanism, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that is still available.

Given the valuations, we can perform a series of draft rounds, allowing each agent to pick one item at a time based on their highest available valuation until all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 5 (value 86).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 5 (already taken), so they pick item 2 (value 65).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 7 (value 50).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 6 (value 92).
5. **Agent 4** picks item 4 (value 70).
6. **Agent 5** picks item 2 (already taken), so they pick item 0 (value 47).

Now each agent picks another item:

7. **Agent 0** picks item 1 (value 64).
8. **Agent 1** picks item 7 (already taken), so they pick item 7 (already taken).
9. **Agent 2** picks item 3 (value 34).
10. **Agent 3** picks item 8 (value 78).
11. **Agent 4** picks item 3 (already taken), so they pick item 6 (already taken).
12. **Agent 5** picks item 6 (already taken), so they pick item 8 (already taken).

Continue this process until all items are allocated:

Finally, the allocation might look like this:

- **Agent 0**: [5, 1]
- **Agent 1**: [4]
- **Agent 2**: [7, 3]
- **Agent 3**: [6]
- **Agent 4**: [0]
- **Agent 5**: [2, 8]

The JSON format for this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner consistent with their valuations, aiming to minimize envy.
