Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  96  30  77  62  71  94  57   2
1  28  95  15  77  63  35  57  48  45
2  21  68  25  93  14  38  39  56  53
3  64  79  18  22  50  52  66  92  42
4  97  33  42  15  40  71  12  97   5
5  34  39  32  46  57  76  81  48  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to follow principles such as envy-freeness and equal treatment of equals. Given the valuations, one potential approach is to use a maximin strategy where we try to maximize the minimum value among all agents.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 73 + 96 + 30 + 77 + 62 + 71 + 94 + 57 + 2 = 562
- Agent 1: 28 + 95 + 15 + 77 + 63 + 35 + 57 + 48 + 45 = 463
- Agent 2: 21 + 68 + 25 + 93 + 14 + 38 + 39 + 56 + 53 = 407
- Agent 3: 64 + 79 + 18 + 22 + 50 + 52 + 66 + 92 + 42 = 485
- Agent 4: 97 + 33 + 42 + 15 + 40 + 71 + 12 + 97 + 5 = 412
- Agent 5: 34 + 39 + 32 + 46 + 57 + 76 + 81 + 48 + 53 = 466

To ensure a fair distribution, we'll allocate items by considering the highest valuations for each agent while trying to minimize envy. Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 1 and 6 (values 96 and 94). To minimize envy, assign:
   - Agent 0 gets items [1, 6].

2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (95), but it's taken. Next is item 3 (77), which is available. Assign:
   - Agent 1 gets item [3].

3. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (93), but it's taken. Next is item 7 (56). Assign:
   - Agent 2 gets item [7].

4. **Agent 3** highly values item 7 (92), but it's taken. Next is item 1 (79), which is also taken. Next is item 6 (66), which is also taken. Next is item 0 (64). Assign:
   - Agent 3 gets item [0].

5. **Agent 4** highly values item 0 (97), but it's taken. Next is item 7 (97), but it's taken. Next is item 5 (71). Assign:
   - Agent 4 gets item [5].

6. **Agent 5** highly values item 6 (81), but it's taken. Next is item 5 (76), but it's taken, and item 7 (48), but taken. Next are items 4 and 8 (57 and 53). Assign:
   - Agent 5 gets items [4, 8].

Now we have assigned all items:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring fair distribution of items.
