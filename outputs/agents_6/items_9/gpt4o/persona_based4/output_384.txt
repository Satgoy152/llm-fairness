Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  32   1  35  35  96  51  95  55
1  84  17  28   6   5  47  74  38  44
2  77  13  26  27  28  15  40  17  27
3  17  11  37  69  41  91  38  21  54
4  64   6  95  34  76   4  69  61  99
5  29   8  40  28   4  14  30  57  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuations.

We will use the maximum envy-free allocation method, attempting to maximize the minimum value that any agent receives. This approach is computationally challenging, but we can perform a heuristic allocation here to approximate the solution given the small size of the problem.

Here's a possible allocation plan:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for items 5 and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 significantly higher than others.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively balanced valuation, but item 6 is a standout.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 8.
6. **Agent 5** doesnâ€™t have very high valuations, so we should allocate items that weren't critical for other agents.

Based on these observations, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agent 0** gets items [5, 7] maximizing their high valuations for these items.
- **Agent 1** gets item [0] as they have the highest valuation for it.
- **Agent 2** receives item [6] which they value significantly.
- **Agent 3** gets item [3], which is highly valued.
- **Agent 4** receives item [8], maximizing their value.
- **Agent 5** gets items [1, 2, 4], which are not highly valued by other agents but maximize their potential value.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, minimizing envy among the agents.
