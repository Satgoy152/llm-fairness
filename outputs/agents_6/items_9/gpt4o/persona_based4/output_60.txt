Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  79  18  29  48   0  80   8  91
1  37  21   2  96  58  51  68  94  45
2  17  46  70  65  16  23   3  59  42
3  40  51  14  16  35  82  37   9  59
4  23  33  30  66  55  68  34  17  46
5   7  78  70  39  40  96  30  91  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a greedy approach that involves allocating items one by one to maximize the total valuation, ensuring an envy-free as possible distribution. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item Across All Agents**: 
   - Item 0: 23 + 37 + 17 + 40 + 23 + 7 = 147
   - Item 1: 79 + 21 + 46 + 51 + 33 + 78 = 308
   - Item 2: 18 + 2 + 70 + 14 + 30 + 70 = 204
   - Item 3: 29 + 96 + 65 + 16 + 66 + 39 = 311
   - Item 4: 48 + 58 + 16 + 35 + 55 + 40 = 252
   - Item 5: 0 + 51 + 23 + 82 + 68 + 96 = 320
   - Item 6: 80 + 68 + 3 + 37 + 34 + 30 = 252
   - Item 7: 8 + 94 + 59 + 9 + 17 + 91 = 278
   - Item 8: 91 + 45 + 42 + 59 + 46 + 40 = 323

2. **Allocate Items**: 
   - Start by allocating the items based on the highest valuation for each item by an agent, ensuring no agent receives more than one item until all have at least one, trying to maintain fairness.

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Item 8 (highest total valuation) goes to Agent 0 (value of 91).
   - Item 5 goes to Agent 5 (value of 96).
   - Item 3 goes to Agent 1 (value of 96).
   - Item 7 goes to Agent 1 (value of 94).
   - Item 1 goes to Agent 0 (value of 79).
   - Item 2 goes to Agent 5 (value of 70).
   - Item 4 goes to Agent 4 (value of 55).
   - Item 0 goes to Agent 3 (value of 40).
   - Item 6 goes to Agent 2 (value of 3, with no better options left).

Considering this method, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while attempting to maximize fairness based on individual valuations.
