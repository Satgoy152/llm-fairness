Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  31  46  85  70   4  68  53  18
1  37  31   5  73  34  13  48  77  78
2  75   8  12  29  19  17  81  78  68
3   7  95  44  93  25  85  97  11   5
4  76  29   5  82  57  22  90  77  51
5  61  57  80  39  37  70  36  96   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can use a method aimed at minimizing envy and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. In this particular case, we'll attempt to allocate the items in a way that balances the total valuation across agents as fairly as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives items that maximize their utility without causing significant envy from other agents. Items 3 and 4 are particularly valuable for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 7 and 8, which are highly valued by them.

3. **Agent 2**: Item 6 is highly valued by Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 highly.

5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 0.

6. **Agent 5**: Values item 2.

Given the valuations, let's distribute the items:

- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: [7, 8]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [2]

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with items being distributed based on their preferences as reflected in their valuations.
