Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  45  42  84  49  39   0  54  98
1  49  70  72  59  98  30  28  21  92
2  79  38  76  40  97  51   5  76  48
3  92  77  36  20  90  94   9  32  98
4  71  77   3   6  51  97   2  21  71
5  87   0  16  96  18  85  72  90  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share of value based on their own valuations. One way to achieve this is by using an algorithm that attempts to balance the distribution of perceived value across agents.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair division with the concept of envy-freeness:

1. **Initial Setup**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items. This helps to understand the perceived value distribution.

2. **Determine Fair Share**: Calculate each agent's fair share based on equal division of the total value of all items.

3. **Allocate Items**: Iteratively assign items to agents to get as close as possible to each agent's fair share while minimizing envy.

Here's the allocation process:

1. Calculate total value of all items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 76 + 45 + 42 + 84 + 49 + 39 + 0 + 54 + 98 = 487
   - Agent 1: 49 + 70 + 72 + 59 + 98 + 30 + 28 + 21 + 92 = 519
   - Agent 2: 79 + 38 + 76 + 40 + 97 + 51 + 5 + 76 + 48 = 510
   - Agent 3: 92 + 77 + 36 + 20 + 90 + 94 + 9 + 32 + 98 = 548
   - Agent 4: 71 + 77 + 3 + 6 + 51 + 97 + 2 + 21 + 71 = 399
   - Agent 5: 87 + 0 + 16 + 96 + 18 + 85 + 72 + 90 + 74 = 538

2. Calculate the fair share for each agent:
   - Total sum of all valuations = 3001
   - Fair share per agent = 3001 / 6 â‰ˆ 500.17

3. Allocate items to agents iteratively, maximizing the agent's valuation for each item:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest valuation of 92)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 70)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 72)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 5 (highest valuation of 96)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 98)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (highest valuation of 94)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 5 (highest valuation of 72)
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 5 (highest valuation of 90)
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 98)

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value while minimizing envy. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

This solution ensures that each item is allocated to an agent and tries to provide a fair distribution based on each agent's valuations.
