Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  13   9  28  66  86  98  58  71
1  26  73   6  12  56  23  94   7   6
2  35  71  77  25  11  65  50  49  63
3  83  40  45  23  25  30   8  40  36
4  30  42  43  70  43  26  13  71   6
5  66  30  21   4   6  65  70   6  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness in discrete settings is challenging, but we can strive for a balanced allocation.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Sum up the values each agent assigns to all items.
2. **Fair Share:** Divide the total valuation of each agent by the number of items to determine the fair share value.
3. **Greedy Allocation:** Iteratively allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each item is allocated only once.

Let's apply this method:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent

- Agent 0: 4 + 13 + 9 + 28 + 66 + 86 + 98 + 58 + 71 = 433
- Agent 1: 26 + 73 + 6 + 12 + 56 + 23 + 94 + 7 + 6 = 303
- Agent 2: 35 + 71 + 77 + 25 + 11 + 65 + 50 + 49 + 63 = 446
- Agent 3: 83 + 40 + 45 + 23 + 25 + 30 + 8 + 40 + 36 = 330
- Agent 4: 30 + 42 + 43 + 70 + 43 + 26 + 13 + 71 + 6 = 344
- Agent 5: 66 + 30 + 21 + 4 + 6 + 65 + 70 + 6 + 21 = 289

### Step 2: Fair Share Calculation

Each agent should ideally get a fair share of about 433/9, 303/9, 446/9, 330/9, 344/9, and 289/9 in terms of their valuation.

### Step 3: Allocation

Let's allocate the items based on the highest value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (98)
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (73)
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (77)
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (83)
- Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (70)
- Agent 5 values item 5 the highest (65)

Allocate these first, then proceed with the next highest unallocated items:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (66)
- Agent 1 gets item 6 (94)
- Remaining item 8 is given to Agent 2 (63)

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on valuations, ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly.
