Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  92  78  72  37  67  12  20  64
1  59  59  72  52  65  33  26  52  67
2  46  31  82  47  17  76   2  63  57
3  80  80  92  79  89  16  66   1  19
4  11  33  78  60  25  85   4  74  12
5  15  59  32  42  47  33  23  86  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. Let's consider various methods like the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) or other fair allocation algorithms to achieve this. However, given the constraints, I'll employ a heuristic approach to allocate the items as equitably as possible.

After examining the valuations, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation maximizes the total satisfaction across all agents. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 8]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 4]
- **Agent 2**: Item [5]
- **Agent 3**: Item [3]
- **Agent 4**: Items [1, 7]
- **Agent 5**: Item [6]

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item, and the distribution attempts to balance the valuations across agents. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a set of items whose total valuation is aimed at maximizing their satisfaction while keeping the overall distribution as fair as possible.
