Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  41  30  91  23  54  80  74  97
1  95  74  94  89  16  12  18  40  92
2  76  21  75   2  97  89   6  17   2
3  50  32  29  70  78   9  46  43   2
4  63  73  66  63  58  38  38  82  65
5  39  69  48  11  64  60   0   3  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly to the agents, I will aim for a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents. I will use the valuations provided and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent maximizes their utility given the constraints.

A straightforward approach to this problem is to use a method known as "Round Robin" or "Competitive Equilibrium from Equal Incomes" (CEEI) for fair division. This involves allowing each agent to take turns picking their most valued item that is still available until all items are allocated. This approach attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's apply a simple round-robin draft based on each agent's preferences:

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0** picks item 8 (97).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 0 (95).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 4 (97).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 4, but it's already taken, so picks item 0, but it's also taken. Picks item 3 (70).
5. **Agent 4** picks item 7 (82).
6. **Agent 5** picks item 4, but it's taken. Picks item 5 (60).
7. **Agent 0** picks item 6 (80).
8. **Agent 1** picks item 2 (94).
9. **Agent 2** picks item 5, but it's taken. Picks item 0, but it's taken. Picks item 1 (21).

At this point, every agent has had at least one round to pick their most valued item, and all items have been allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [8, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences in a sequential manner, aiming to minimize envy by giving each agent a chance to pick their most valued available item in turn.
