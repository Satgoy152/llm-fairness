Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  26  56  91   9  11  35  63  63
1  28  46  22  92  96  36  50  78  81
2  77  75  32  82  71  33  96   2   8
3  87  92  54  76  87  37  82  93  33
4  53  37  41  63  38  79  66  45  46
5  78  51  91  87  12  64  27  16  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll employ a method that seeks to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, given the constraints of the problem. Envy-freeness means that each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation.

Let's start by considering the valuations and finding an allocation that can be considered fair, given that each agent must receive an integer number of items:

1. We will initially consider giving each agent one item they value highly, based on their valuations.
2. We will then allocate the remaining items while ensuring that no agent envies another agent's allocation more than their own.

Here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 seems to value item 3 the most (value 91).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (value 96).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (value 96).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (value 92).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most (value 79).
- Agent 5 values item 2 the most (value 91).

With one item assigned to each agent, we have allocated 6 items, leaving 3 items to allocate (items 0, 7, and 8). Let's distribute these remaining items with the goal of minimizing envy:

- Agent 3 also has a relatively high value for item 7 (value 93), so we'll give them item 7.
- Agent 5 has a relatively high value for item 8 (value 47), so we'll give them item 8.
- Agent 0 has a relatively high value for item 0 (value 15), so we'll give them item 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 8]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item and all 9 items are allocated. This allocation attempts to respect the preferences of each agent by giving them items they value highly.
