Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  87   2  75  56  32  87  91  19
1  87  15  46  26  94  61   2  48  23
2   7  68  58  55  60  22  99  50  21
3  96   7  15  23  12  67  97  59  57
4  48  26  30  76  10  67  45  32  48
5  43  10  69  31  42  64   5  67  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we can use an approach that distributes items based on maximizing the minimum utility (value) each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets an allocation they value highly while reducing envy among agents.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items 1 (87), 6 (87), and 7 (91) highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Values items 0 (87) and 4 (94) highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Values items 6 (99) highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Values items 0 (96), 6 (97), and 7 (59) highly.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 (76) highly.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 2 (69) and 7 (67) highly.

A possible fair allocation strategy is as follows:

- Give **Agent 0** item 7 (91), as it is their highest value item.
- Give **Agent 1** item 4 (94), as it is their highest value item.
- Give **Agent 2** item 6 (99), as it is their highest value item.
- Give **Agent 3** item 0 (96), as it is their highest value item.
- Give **Agent 4** item 3 (76), as it is their highest value item.
- Give **Agent 5** item 2 (69), as it is their highest value item.

Now, allocate the remaining items 1, 5, and 8 by considering the next highest values or balancing the total value across agents:

- Assign item 1 to **Agent 0** since they value it (87).
- Assign item 5 to **Agent 1** since they value it (61).
- Assign item 8 to **Agent 3** since they value it (57).

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives at least one high-value item according to their preferences, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2]
}
```
