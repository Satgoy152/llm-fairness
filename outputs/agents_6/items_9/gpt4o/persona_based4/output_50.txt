Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  85  76  95  89  18  88  50  47
1  70  12  40  92  88  32   6  87  50
2  52  47   3  99  62  52  86  89  68
3  41  11   2  94  72  65  82  39  59
4  25  45  92  29  82  30  90  62  74
5  31  89  91  55  33  14  73  21  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We'll use a simple approach, ensuring each agent gets an item in a way that attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value on item 3 (95).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value on item 0 (70).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value on item 3, already taken. Next highest is item 7 (89).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value on item 3, already taken. Next highest is item 6 (82).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value on item 2 (92).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value on item 1 (89).

Items 4, 5, and 8 are left. Let's allocate them considering the remaining preferences:

7. **Agent 0**: Next highest value on item 4 (89).
8. **Agent 3**: Next highest value on item 5 (65).
9. **Agent 1**: Next highest value on item 8 (50).

Now let's summarize the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6, 5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation attempts to maximize the individual satisfaction based on their highest available valuations.
