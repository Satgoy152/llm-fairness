Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  32  67  57  23  15  35  13  99
1  14  26  83  42  44  64  89  31  51
2  83   0  99  71  54  83  81  34  37
3  91  14  72  77  75  59  57  17  50
4  19  37  66  73  44  68  24  88  32
5  71  86   0   0  25  15  39  55  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, minimizing potential envy. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, let's proceed with allocating the items based on maximizing individual valuations and balancing the total value each agent receives.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Assign the highest valued items to the agent who values them the most.
2. **Balance Total Value**: After high-value items are allocated, distribute the remaining items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Item 8** is valued highest (99) by Agent 0. Assign Item 8 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2** is valued highest (99) by Agent 2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 0** is valued highest (91) by Agent 3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 3.
4. **Item 6** is valued highest (89) by Agent 1. Assign Item 6 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 7** is valued highest (88) by Agent 4. Assign Item 7 to Agent 4.
6. **Item 1** is valued highest (86) by Agent 5. Assign Item 1 to Agent 5.
7. **Item 5** is valued high (83) by Agents 2 and 3, assign to Agent 2, who doesn't have a second item.
8. **Item 3** is valued high (77) by Agent 3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
9. **Item 4** is valued high (75) by Agent 3 and 54 by Agent 2. Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 to balance.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 3, 4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while balancing the total value distributed among them. It attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent access to their highest valued unallocated items, adhering to integer allocation constraints.
