Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  96  42  92  61  77  48  49   8
1   3  48   1  90  29  50  13  58  19
2  91  37  93  56  43   7   3  38  44
3  93  62  44  26  42  14  58  15  25
4  61   4  97   8   7  52   0  51  83
5  62   9  58  26   1  43  70  90   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an allocation where no agent feels envy. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations, let's attempt to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (96) and item 3 (92)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (90)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (93)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (93)
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (97)
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (90)

We will try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations and ensure that all items are allocated:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 4
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 5

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (4, 5, 6, 8):

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation after item 2)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation after item 1)
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation after item 0)
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 4 (next highest valuation after item 2)

Now, each agent has been allocated at least one item, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [2, 8],
    "5": [7]
}
```
