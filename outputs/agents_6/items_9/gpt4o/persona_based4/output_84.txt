Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  85   0  88  27  63  88  49  70
1  99  93  74   2  23  13  87  22  86
2   3  57  41  31  99  31  65  62  49
3   2  76  91  86  13  18  21  63  73
4  53  55  86  25  90  94  86  16   4
5  22  58   6  75  10  14  90  66  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, or at least a fair allocation, considering the valuations provided. We will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. Here's a proposed fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 (Value: 88)
   - Item 6 (Value: 88)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 0 (Value: 99)
   - Item 8 (Value: 86)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 4 (Value: 99)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 2 (Value: 91)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Item 5 (Value: 94)

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Item 7 (Value: 66)
   - Item 1 (Value: 58)

This allocation considers the highest valuations per item and distributes them such that each agent gets a fair share relative to the others. Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 6 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item where possible.
