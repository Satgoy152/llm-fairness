Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  35  33  97  56  56  96  78  58
1  74  22  98  44  70  43  43  62  33
2  52  54  62  92  18  89   9  64  73
3  67  37  82  43  95  89  28  42  29
4  78  74  90  60  84  51  11  49  45
5  69  28  71  87  36  87  89  88  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation based on their preferences, thus minimizing envy. We will use a heuristic approach to assign the items to the agents based on their valuations.

Given the constraints:
- We have 6 agents and 9 items to allocate.
- Each agent can receive an integer number of items.
- All 9 items must be allocated.

We'll start by examining the valuations and attempting to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 3 (97), second highest for item 6 (96).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 2 (98), second option items 4 (70).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 3 (92), second highest for item 5 (89).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 4 (95), second highest for item 5 (89).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 2 (90), second highest for item 4 (84).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value for item 6 (89), second highest for item 5 (87).

After considering these preferences, we should consider the highest values first and try to allocate items accordingly to minimize envy.

Here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (73), item 6 (96)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 2 (98), item 7 (62)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (92), item 8 (73)
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 5 (89)
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 4 (84)
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 1 (28), item 5 (87)

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and the total number of items is distributed.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
