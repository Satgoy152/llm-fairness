Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  52  69  48  64  86  86  23  95
1   5  20  89  69  36  45  18  13  57
2  74  80  22  78  90   6  87  38  35
3   5  34  49  33  88  34  57  88  22
4  95  74  19  68  72  17  36  14  42
5  58  28  76  17  45   3  15  21  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 28 76 17 45  3 15 21 38]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the six agents, we will attempt to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach in fair division problems is to use methods like the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) or to ensure that each agent receives as close as possible to an equal share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations table, we can apply a heuristic approach to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that no agent receives more than two items (since there are 9 items and 6 agents):

1. Item 0: Allocated to Agent 4 (value 95)
2. Item 1: Allocated to Agent 2 (value 80)
3. Item 2: Allocated to Agent 1 (value 89)
4. Item 3: Allocated to Agent 2 (value 78)
5. Item 4: Allocated to Agent 2 (value 90)
6. Item 5: Allocated to Agent 0 (value 86)
7. Item 6: Allocated to Agent 0 (value 86)
8. Item 7: Allocated to Agent 3 (value 88)
9. Item 8: Allocated to Agent 0 (value 95)

By this allocation, we ensure that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while trying to maintain a balance in the number of items each agent receives. Now, let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3, 4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with agents receiving items based on their highest valuations, while trying to maintain fairness.
