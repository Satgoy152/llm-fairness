Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  42  45  58  59  34  54  33  44
1  63  53  26  54  50  19  17  18   1
2  73  64  16  59  40  95  78  66  41
3  40  62  38  43  81  71  24  97  93
4  49  28  67  12  66  42  95  75  56
5  75  55  74   4  83  61  87  83  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents with envy-freeness in mind, we'll aim for a division where each agent feels that their allocation is as valuable as possible, given their subjective valuations. Since we have 9 items and 6 agents, not every agent will necessarily receive an item, but we'll ensure all items are allocated.

Let's first summarize each agent's total valuation for the items to help guide the allocation:

- Agent 0: 90 + 42 + 45 + 58 + 59 + 34 + 54 + 33 + 44 = 459
- Agent 1: 63 + 53 + 26 + 54 + 50 + 19 + 17 + 18 + 1 = 301
- Agent 2: 73 + 64 + 16 + 59 + 40 + 95 + 78 + 66 + 41 = 532
- Agent 3: 40 + 62 + 38 + 43 + 81 + 71 + 24 + 97 + 93 = 549
- Agent 4: 49 + 28 + 67 + 12 + 66 + 42 + 95 + 75 + 56 = 490
- Agent 5: 75 + 55 + 74 + 4 + 83 + 61 + 87 + 83 + 37 = 559

We need to allocate items such that as many agents as possible can receive items they value highly, minimizing envy. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2: Agent 2 values this item the most.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3: Agent 3 values this item the most.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4: Agent 4 values this item the most.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 5: Agent 5 values this item the most.
- Assign remaining items 1, 2, 3, 8 to balance the allocation.

Final allocation could be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4, 1, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one item they value highly while ensuring that all items are allocated. Agent 5 receives more items but less individually valued ones to balance item count and value.
