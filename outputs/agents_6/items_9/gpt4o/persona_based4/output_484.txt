Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  42   4  72  14  19  16   9  79
1  11  56   8  98   3  29  43  94  11
2  75  50  17  79  20  92  87  95  27
3  49   3  52  48  65  38   1  50  51
4  85  83  75  37  79  20  46  84  10
5  32  83  41   9   8   2  53  53   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with respect to their valuations and ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, we can apply a heuristic approach. This involves considering each agent's preferences and attempting to allocate items to minimize envy.

Below is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the highest (79). Allocating item 8 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (98). Allocating item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (95). Allocating item 7 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (65). Allocating item 4 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (85). Allocating item 0 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the highest (83). Allocating item 1 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and we need to allocate 3 more items. We will consider the next highest unallocated valued items for each agent.

- For Agent 0, after item 8, item 3 is highly valued (72), but it's already allocated. The next unallocated highest valued item is item 1 (42). But since it's allocated to Agent 5, we allocate item 6 (16) to Agent 0.
- For Agent 1, after item 3, item 1 is highly valued (56), but it's already allocated. The next unallocated highest valued item is item 2 (8).
- For Agent 3, item 5 (38) is allocated based on the next highest preference.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items while attempting to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```
