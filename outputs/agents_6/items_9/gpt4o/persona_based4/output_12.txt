Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  71   9  77  87  47  24  60  25
1  31  37  26  30  58  97  18  95   5
2  18  31  44  84  68  72  46  81  75
3  91  39  24  77  34  25  40  42  34
4  98  59  79  61  11  14  78  91  18
5  90  12  41  56  49  75  98  39   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can attempt to balance the total valuation each agent receives. We will use a heuristic approach to assign items to agents based on their preferences.

Let's start by considering the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 495
- Agent 1: 397
- Agent 2: 519
- Agent 3: 406
- Agent 4: 509
- Agent 5: 468

We will try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share of the total valuation while keeping the allocations envy-free as much as possible.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 0 (98) and item 7 (91). Let's allocate item 0 and item 7 to Agent 4.
2. **Agent 2** has high valuations for item 5 (72) and item 3 (84). Allocate items 5 and 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 5** has high valuation for item 6 (98). Allocate item 6 to Agent 5.
4. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1 (37) and item 7 (95). Since item 7 is already taken, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 4 (87). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 0 (91), which is already taken. Allocate item 8 (42) to Agent 3.
7. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 2 (9). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

After these allocations, we must ensure every item is allocated. We have allocated 8 items, and there's one item left (item 8).

8. Allocate item 8 to **Agent 3** who has some value for it, completing the allocation.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [0, 7],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while keeping the distribution as envy-free as possible.
