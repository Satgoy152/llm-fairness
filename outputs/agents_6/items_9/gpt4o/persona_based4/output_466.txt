Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  61  95  46  99  62  81  10  46
1  76  74  51  53  99  70  68  72  66
2   7  85  55  22  46  26  43  19  65
3   7  52  32  71   1  17  52   3  30
4  16  71  18  85  19  99  55  96  61
5  56  78  80   4  73  29  91  74  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we can use algorithms like the envy-free matching or other fair division algorithms. However, given the discrete nature of the problem and the need to allocate all items, I'll use a heuristic approach that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**: Look at the values each agent assigns to items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share, minimizing envy.

2. **Distribute High-Value Items First**: Since agents will value some items more highly than others, start by allocating high-value items to agents who value them the most.

3. **Balance Remaining Items**: Continue by distributing the remaining items to balance the total value received by each agent.

4. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**: Ensure no agent would prefer another's allocation over their own.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly, and no one else values it as much. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly, and no one else values it as much. Assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 8 highly, and no one else values it as much. Assign item 8 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly, and no one else values it as much. Assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly, and no one else values it as much. Assign item 5 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 6 highly, and no one else values it as much. Assign item 6 to agent 5.
- For the remaining items, distribute them to balance total value:
  - Assign item 0 to agent 0.
  - Assign item 2 to agent 1.
  - Assign item 7 to agent 4.

This leads to the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 7],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives while using an intuitive approach to minimize envy.
