Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  78  57   7  97  24  60  62  52
1   1  73  62  68  61  88   8  46  94
2  38  55  63  82  36  37  95  84  59
3  92  11  42  81  88  25  72  35  34
4  19  47  12  59  39  22  28  71  79
5   4  56  51   0  87  38  58  69  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. However, given the discrete nature of this problem (items cannot be divided), perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable, but we will strive to minimize overall envy.

Given the table of valuations, one approach is to allocate items to maximize each agent's perceived value while ensuring that all items are distributed. This can be done by assigning the highest-valued items to the agents who value them most, balancing this against other agents' needs to prevent significant envy.

Here is one possible allocation, attempting to balance the valuations fairly:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4.
- Agent 1 should get item 8 for high value.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly.
- Agent 4 could take item 7, which they value the most among available items.
- Agent 5 could take items 3 and 5, as they have relatively high valuations for them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and the distribution is balanced as much as possible given the initial preferences. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3, 5, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 6 agents, providing each agent with at least one item they value highly, while striving to minimize envy.
