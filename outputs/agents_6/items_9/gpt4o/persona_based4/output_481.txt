Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  95  92  48  16  72  22  17  59
1  69  30  48  17  77  91  27  16  63
2  79  53  77  72  43  53  56  26  69
3  21  48  50  26   7  14  81  78   4
4  26  85  36   8  55  44  36  71  37
5  13  90  66  17  82  80  67  28  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel at least as satisfied with their own allocation as with any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations matrix, we need to distribute the 9 items among the 6 agents.

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a method such as the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued available item. However, given the complexity of ensuring complete envy-freeness, we will aim for a balanced distribution that reflects a fair share according to the given valuations.

Letâ€™s proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items to determine their overall preference.
2. Allocate items in a way that balances the total valuation each agent receives, trying to distribute items in a way that avoids envy.

The total valuation for each agent is:

- Agent 0: 477
- Agent 1: 438
- Agent 2: 528
- Agent 3: 329
- Agent 4: 398
- Agent 5: 460

We will aim to allocate the items so that the total valuation for each agent is roughly balanced.

Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 5, 8
- Agent 2 receives items: 1, 3
- Agent 3 receives items: 6
- Agent 4 receives items: 7
- Agent 5 receives items: 4

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their preferences in a manner that is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4]
}
```
