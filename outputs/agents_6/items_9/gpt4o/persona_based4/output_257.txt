Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6   0  27   1  43  87  57  48   5
1  18  19  38  89  66  66  18  11  39
2  43   2  73  40  10  29  46  75  18
3   1  19  15  42  47  66  15  26  60
4  36  79  37  34  25  93  45  11  39
5   3  93  84  39  48  70  47   7  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation or at least their proportional fair share. This approach aims to minimize envy among agents. Below is one possible allocation method using a greedy algorithm:

1. Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on maximizing their valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

The total valuations for each agent are:

- Agent 0: 274
- Agent 1: 344
- Agent 2: 336
- Agent 3: 291
- Agent 4: 399
- Agent 5: 417

Next, allocate items to the agents:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (87)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (89)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (73)
- Agent 3: Item 8 (60)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (79)
- Agent 5: Item 6 (47)

Now, allocate the remaining items to maximize each agent's valuation and ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 0 (6), 7 (48)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (66)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (46)
- Agent 3: Item 8 (60)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (79)
- Agent 5: Items 5 (70), 3 (39)

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure each agent receives items they highly value, minimizing potential envy and ensuring a fair division given the constraints.
