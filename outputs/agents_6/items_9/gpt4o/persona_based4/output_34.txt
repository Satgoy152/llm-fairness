Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  34  37  19  11  54  15  65   5
1  56  22  30  94  57  35  98  29  76
2  27   6   9  54  27  81  45  82   6
3  87   1  27  22  14   6  70  65  72
4  36  41  73  76  13  42  97  62   0
5  40  66   3  49  13  62  14  21  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness to the best possible extent. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations. With 9 items and 6 agents, it is impossible to give each agent the same number of items, but we can attempt to balance the value each agent receives.

Let's analyze the distribution:

1. **Agent 0:** Prefers item 7 (65), item 5 (54), and item 2 (37).
2. **Agent 1:** Prefers item 6 (98), item 3 (94), and item 8 (76).
3. **Agent 2:** Prefers item 7 (82), item 5 (81), and item 6 (45).
4. **Agent 3:** Prefers item 0 (87), item 8 (72), and item 6 (70).
5. **Agent 4:** Prefers item 6 (97), item 3 (76), and item 2 (73).
6. **Agent 5:** Prefers item 8 (85), item 1 (66), and item 5 (62).

We'll distribute the items focusing on the highest individual preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, where possible.

- **Agent 0:** Gets item 7 (65)
- **Agent 1:** Gets item 6 (98)
- **Agent 2:** Gets item 5 (81)
- **Agent 3:** Gets item 0 (87)
- **Agent 4:** Gets item 3 (76)
- **Agent 5:** Gets item 8 (85)

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items fairly, considering the remaining high preferences.

- **Agent 0:** Also gets item 2 (37)
- **Agent 1:** Also gets item 4 (57)
- **Agent 4:** Also gets item 1 (41)

Let's confirm the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [7, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [6, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: Item [0]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 1]
- Agent 5: Item [8]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences. Let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 1],
    "5": [8]
}
```
