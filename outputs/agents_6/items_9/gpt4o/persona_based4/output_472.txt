Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  44  15  79  37  35  30  22  84
1  37  90  88  11  27  42  99  45  39
2  96  84  38  63  92  62  81  71  30
3  53  33  62  74  74  98  85  83  68
4  82  19  71  96  57  68  88  87   6
5  48  26  15  12  30  26  43  51  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we will aim for a distribution that ensures envy-freeness as much as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers someone else's allocation to their own. 

Let's proceed with the allocation while attempting to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 3 (79), 8 (84)
   - Allocate items 3 and 8 to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (90), 2 (88)
   - Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 0 (96), 4 (92)
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 2.
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 5 (98), 6 (85)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 (since item 6 has already been chosen for higher preference by others).
   
5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value items: 3 (96), 6 (88)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4 (item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0).
   
6. **Agent 5**: 
   - The remaining items are 7 and 6. Item 6 is already allocated, so allocate item 7 to Agent 5.

Based on the above allocation, let's check the assignments:

- Agent 0: [3, 8]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [7]

All 9 items are allocated, and the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7]
}
```
