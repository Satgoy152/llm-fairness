Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  46  23  73   0  74  50  38  12
1  30  11  14  64  93   9  52  63  35
2  25  53  94  34  91  26  79  18  28
3  54  49  20  50  17  46  74  29  57
4  45  67  74  76  69  77  43  92  25
5  61  72  40  11  74  18  96  14   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method known as the "greedy allocation" approach. This approach involves assigning items to agents based on their individual valuations, trying to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step method to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Setup**: Create an empty allocation list for each agent.

2. **Allocate Items**: Iterate over each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If an agent ends up with no items, swap one of their least valued items with another agent who has more than one item.

4. **Check for Completeness**: Ensure that exactly 9 items have been allocated in total.

Let's perform this allocation:

1. **Assign Items to Agents**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 78, which is the highest, so assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 5 values it at 72, which is the highest, so assign to Agent 5.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 94, which is the highest, so assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 73, which is the highest, so assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 93, which is the highest, so assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 4 values it at 77, which is the highest, so assign to Agent 4.
   - Item 6: Agent 5 values it at 96, which is the highest, so assign to Agent 5.
   - Item 7: Agent 4 values it at 92, which is the highest, so assign to Agent 4.
   - Item 8: Agent 3 values it at 57, which is the highest, so assign to Agent 3.

After this allocation, each agent has at least one item, and all items have been allocated.

2. **Final Allocation**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5, 7],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are distributed in a way that maximizes the sum of the values assigned to each agent.
