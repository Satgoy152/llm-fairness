Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  77  42  17  35  55  58   9  20
1  46  62  48  60  41  44  25  13  99
2  49  64  99  77  86  34  94  60  39
3  64  43  69  55  34  87  98  68  73
4  91  78  25  55  94  98  97  26  37
5  26   9  68  93   6   8  81  84  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to minimize envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent believes that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuations.

One simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Given there are 9 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally receive 1 or 2 items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (77), Item 6 (58)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (99), Item 3 (60)
   - Assign Item 8 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (99), Item 6 (94)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (98), Item 5 (87)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (98), Item 6 (97)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (93), Item 7 (84)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 5.

Now, each agent has received one item. The remaining items are 0, 4, and 7. We can allocate these items as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Assign Item 0 (value 31) because it ranks relatively high among remaining items.
- **Agent 4:** Assign Item 4 (value 94), which is the highest remaining value for Agent 4.
- **Agent 5:** Assign Item 7 (value 84), which is the highest remaining value for Agent 5.

This allocation attempts to balance the items fairly across the agents based on their valuations.

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 4],
    "5": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to do so in a way that minimizes envy based on their valuations.
