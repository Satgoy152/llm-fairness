Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  94  31  59  88   8  90  97  11
1  39  34  59  87   7  28  20  53  86
2  43  65  54   4  67  99  50  21  73
3  88   1   4  24   0  19  43  98  73
4  92  34  82  44  74  98  47  57  49
5  22  81  63  58  89  35  59   3  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's attempt to allocate the items using a heuristic approach. We will try to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items according to their preferences.

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items with high values: 7 (97), 1 (94), 6 (90)
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items with high values: 3 (87), 8 (86), 2 (59)
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items with high values: 5 (99), 4 (67), 8 (73)
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items with high values: 7 (98), 0 (88), 8 (73)
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers items with high values: 0 (92), 5 (98), 4 (74)
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers items with high values: 4 (89), 1 (81), 2 (63)

Based on this analysis, we try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's value according to their preferences.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [7] (value 97)
- **Agent 1**: [3, 8] (value 87 + 86 = 173)
- **Agent 2**: [5] (value 99)
- **Agent 3**: [0] (value 88)
- **Agent 4**: [4] (value 74)
- **Agent 5**: [1, 2, 6] (value 81 + 63 + 59 = 203)

This allocation seeks to maximize each agent's value based on their preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and only 9 items are allocated in total, meeting the requirement.
