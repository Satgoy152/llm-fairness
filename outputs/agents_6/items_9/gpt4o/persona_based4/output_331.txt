Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  72  93  55  99  47  71  81  48
1  11  99  74   2  53  87  73  64  94
2  99  19  57  79  84   0   2  44  37
3  36  41  89  75  87  54  58  11  51
4  96  61  58  65  58  99  45  75  43
5  15  55  54  38   7  21  55  22  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to allocate the items in such a way that no agent envies another agent's allocation. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be quite complex, especially with integer constraints, we aim for a fair approximation given the valuations.

Hereâ€™s a strategy to allocate the items:
1. Calculate each agent's total value for all items.
2. Attempt to distribute items in a way that balances the total value perceived by each agent.

Let's first calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 592
- Agent 1: 557
- Agent 2: 421
- Agent 3: 502
- Agent 4: 600
- Agent 5: 362

A fair allocation will aim to balance these total valuations as closely as possible. Since each agent must receive an integer number of items, and there are 9 items in total, we'll give each agent one or two items, attempting to balance the total value for each agent.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [0]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [5, 7]
- Agent 5: Items [6]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, with a focus on balancing the total perceived value across agents.

Now, in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 7],
    "5": [6]
}
```
