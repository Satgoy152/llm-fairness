Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  44  60  84  84  95  24  82  83
1  64  47  77  28  12  80  24  24  46
2  11  13  55  36  81  94   4  89  50
3  71  47  28  28  82  67  49  76  37
4  58  31  21  57   1  90  37   2  17
5  48  63  20  22  32  61  88  37  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we can consider maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives or ensuring that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation given their preferences. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences.
2. Use an algorithm such as round-robin to allocate items based on the valuations, allowing each agent to pick their most valued available item in sequence until all items are allocated.

Let's distribute the items:

- Agent 0: [5] (95)
- Agent 1: [2] (77)
- Agent 2: [7] (89)
- Agent 3: [4] (82)
- Agent 4: [3] (57)
- Agent 5: [8] (94)

Now we have 3 items left: [0, 1, 6]

Continuing with the allocation:

- Agent 0: [5, 1] (95, 44)
- Agent 1: [2, 0] (77, 64)
- Agent 2: [7] (89)
- Agent 3: [4] (82)
- Agent 4: [3] (57)
- Agent 5: [8, 6] (94, 88)

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent getting at least one item and attempting to respect their valuation preferences as much as possible.
