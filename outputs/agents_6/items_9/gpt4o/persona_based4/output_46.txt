Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73   3  91  49  47  48  17  12  49
1  62  76  60  57   1  66  82  72  46
2  36  56  83  23  60  66  69  67  91
3  61   3  17  96   9  60  61  38  70
4  44  36  99  17  91  94  85  62  29
5  51  50  85  44  61  55  74   4  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while trying to maintain envy-freeness, we can use a greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns the most valuable available item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 73. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 76. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it the most at 99. Assign Item 2 to Agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most at 96. Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it the most at 91. Assign Item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 values it the most at 94. Assign Item 5 to Agent 4.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 82. Assign Item 6 to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it the most at 72. Assign Item 7 to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 2 values it the most at 91. Assign Item 8 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 6, 7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4, 5],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item (except Agent 5, who receives none due to the limited number of items and the preference values), and the allocation is done in a way to reduce potential envy by giving items to the agents who value them the most.
