Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  29  34  54  76  68  49  67  91
1  71  94  89  54  95  70  12  44  50
2  40  34  27  52  12  47  70  64  32
3  39  47  81  91  37  82   5   0  64
4  86  19  95  58  60  22   6  16  92
5  98  33  96  23  54   0  70  38  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method inspired by the "Envy-Free" and "Max-Min Fair Share" concepts. A simple approach is to start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and examining how to reassign items to maintain balance.

Let's analyze the table and proceed with the allocation:

### Step 1: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most

- Item 0: Agent 5 values it the most with 98.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with 94.
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most with 96.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most with 91.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most with 95.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with 68.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most with 70.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most with 67.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it the most with 91.

### Step 2: Check for any unallocated items or adjustments needed

Since the direct allocation gives some agents multiple items while others none, let's adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 7, 8
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: No initial allocation
- Agent 5: Items 0, 2

### Step 3: Balance the allocation

Reassign some items where needed to ensure each agent can get at least one item if possible:

1. Move Item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 4.
2. Move Item 7 from Agent 0 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [8]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [6, 7]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [0, 2]

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item while distributing the items based on their valuations.
