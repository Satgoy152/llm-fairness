Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  28  26  93  97  63  57  74  92
1  18  27  72  28  30  41   3  22  53
2  59  63  93  63   5  14  91  69  16
3  98   3  40  36  68  58  61  77  43
4  56   9  61  34  67  32  61  86  36
5  92  67  44  25  81  20  91  63  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation. A common approach is to use the "round-robin" method or a similar strategy that respects each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total valuation.

Given the valuations, hereâ€™s a way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign items to agents based on their maximum individual valuations while ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item if possible. 
3. Adjust as necessary to ensure that each agent ends up with a fair amount of the total value.

Based on this approach, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (90) and also values item 8 highly (92).
- Agent 1's highest valued item is item 2 (72).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (91).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (36).
- Agent 4's highest valued item is item 7 (86).
- Agent 5 values item 4 the most (81) and has significant value in items 1 (67) and 5 (20).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible. Note that some agents receive more items due to the distribution of values and the need to allocate all 9 items.
