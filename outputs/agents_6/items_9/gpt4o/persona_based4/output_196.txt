Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  17  42  34  21  66  15  71  76
1  74  62  37  20  38  20  58  23  91
2  10  79  56  77  75  96  29  97  50
3  46  18  23   2  32  73  99  53  27
4  80   6  36  86  19  19  68  66  92
5  89  78  63  96  59  39  13  21  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure envy-freeness and equitable distribution of valued items. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations. Here is a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 highly (80). Allocating item 0 to Agent 0 makes sense. Agent 0 also values item 8 highly (76), so we allocate item 8 to them as well.
   
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 8 the most (91), but since item 8 is already assigned, we consider the next highest: item 0 (74) and item 1 (62). However, item 0 is already assigned, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Values items 7 (97) and 5 (96) highly. We'll allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 the most (99). We allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Values item 4 the most (86), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Values item 3 the most (96) and item 5 (39). Since item 3 is still available, we allocate item 3 to Agent 5.

Now, we need to ensure each agent receives an item and the total allocation equals to 9 items. Let's review the remaining items and see how we can allocate them:

- Remaining items: [2, 5, 9]

Revisiting the agents:

- **Agent 1**: Add item 2 (37).
- **Agent 2**: Add item 5 (96).
- **Agent 4**: Add item 9 (19).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

Each agent has received at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. The allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on the highest preferences.
