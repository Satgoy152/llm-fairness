Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  96  36  86  68   6  52   1  92
1  47  62  79   8  38  95  84  94  40
2   7  45  26  89  94   2  46  18  25
3  60  11  84  87  69  24  89  17  43
4  83  50  64  35  34  21  14  97  51
5   7  42  25  51  85  98   2  46  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can employ the Envy-Free method, which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations, a balanced approach is to allocate items such that each agent has a similar total valuation of their assigned items.

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Total Valuations for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: 95 + 96 + 36 + 86 + 68 + 6 + 52 + 1 + 92 = 532
   - Agent 1: 47 + 62 + 79 + 8 + 38 + 95 + 84 + 94 + 40 = 547
   - Agent 2: 7 + 45 + 26 + 89 + 94 + 2 + 46 + 18 + 25 = 352
   - Agent 3: 60 + 11 + 84 + 87 + 69 + 24 + 89 + 17 + 43 = 484
   - Agent 4: 83 + 50 + 64 + 35 + 34 + 21 + 14 + 97 + 51 = 449
   - Agent 5: 7 + 42 + 25 + 51 + 85 + 98 + 2 + 46 + 19 = 375

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Fairness**:
   The goal is to ensure that each agent's total valuation for their allocated items is as balanced as possible, while maintaining an integer number of items for each agent.

3. **Suggested Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 8] (Valuation: 95 + 92 = 187)
   - Agent 1: Items [5, 6] (Valuation: 95 + 84 = 179)
   - Agent 2: Items [3, 4] (Valuation: 89 + 94 = 183)
   - Agent 3: Items [2] (Valuation: 84)
   - Agent 4: Items [7] (Valuation: 97)
   - Agent 5: Items [1] (Valuation: 42)

These allocations provide a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations, minimizing envy among agents.
