Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  30  85  80  40  74  74  99   1
1  22  78   5  80  23  40  61  50   7
2  80  71  65  28  62  71  58  50  53
3  22  32  94  20  20  93  37  44  90
4  79  28   1  72  65  68  77  16  62
5  89   8  74  42  96  57  29  83  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent to their own.

First, let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items to get an idea of their preferences:

- Agent 0: 87 + 30 + 85 + 80 + 40 + 74 + 74 + 99 + 1 = 570
- Agent 1: 22 + 78 + 5 + 80 + 23 + 40 + 61 + 50 + 7 = 366
- Agent 2: 80 + 71 + 65 + 28 + 62 + 71 + 58 + 50 + 53 = 538
- Agent 3: 22 + 32 + 94 + 20 + 20 + 93 + 37 + 44 + 90 = 452
- Agent 4: 79 + 28 + 1 + 72 + 65 + 68 + 77 + 16 + 62 = 468
- Agent 5: 89 + 8 + 74 + 42 + 96 + 57 + 29 + 83 + 87 = 565

Next, let's attempt to allocate the items by considering the highest value each agent assigns to any item and ensuring roughly equal total valuations.

A possible allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 7 (values: 87, 99; total = 186)
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 3 (values: 78, 80; total = 158)
- Agent 2 gets items: 2, 5 (values: 65, 71; total = 136)
- Agent 3 gets items: 8 (values: 90; total = 90)
- Agent 4 gets items: 6 (values: 77; total = 77)
- Agent 5 gets items: 4 (values: 96; total = 96)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives while considering their preferences. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, and aims to minimize envy as much as possible given the agents' valuations.
