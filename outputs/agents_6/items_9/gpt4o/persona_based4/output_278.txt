Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  42  24   1  66  61  80  30  84
1  68  25  14  34  29  54  59  12  35
2  95  13  32  58  77  31   5   8  48
3  77  58  73  69  51  40  81   7  21
4  38   0  24  76  67  27  42  53  49
5  68  67  59  86  18  56  72  88   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible, we'll consider each agent's preferences for each item and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly. Given the constraints, we'll aim for a balanced allocation, though perfect envy-freeness may not be achievable due to the discrete nature of items and differing valuations.

Let's allocate the items in a way that tries to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 8 (84), 6 (80), and 4 (66).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 0 (68), 6 (59), and 5 (54).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 0 (95), 4 (77), and 3 (58).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 6 (81), 0 (77), and 2 (73).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers items 3 (76), 4 (67), and 7 (53).
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers items 7 (88), 3 (86), and 6 (72).

Considering the preferences and attempting to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 8 (84).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 0 (68).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4 (77).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6 (81).
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 3 (76).
- **Agent 5**: Allocate item 7 (88).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items 1, 2, and 5:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5 (61), as the next best choice.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (25).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 (32).

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives items they value more highly and balances the allocation across agents. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7]
}
```
