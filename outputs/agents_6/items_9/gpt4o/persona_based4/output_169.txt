Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  76   9  97  97   9  74  52  12
1  24  27  65   8   7  83  96  60  82
2  80  98  20  28  92  82  57  22  68
3  43  77  39  55  96  40  72   6  25
4  29  27  19  18  34  19  76  79  80
5  43  57   2  20  55  94  73  74  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible, meaning each agent should feel satisfied with their bundle of items compared to others based on their valuations. We will also ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Given the valuations, let's look for an allocation that tries to maximize individual satisfaction while minimizing envy. We'll use a simple method by assigning items based on each agent's highest valuations, assuming that leads to a less envious distribution.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Values items 3 and 4 highly (each 97), so allocate those.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 most (96), allocate that item.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 most (98), allocate that item.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 most (96), but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 1 (77), which is also taken. Next is item 0 (43), allocate that.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is item 8 (80), allocate that.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is item 5 (94), allocate that.

Now re-evaluate to ensure no remaining items are left unallocated:

- Item 0: Allocated to Agent 3
- Item 1: Allocated to Agent 2
- Item 2: Unallocated
- Item 3: Allocated to Agent 0
- Item 4: Allocated to Agent 0
- Item 5: Allocated to Agent 5
- Item 6: Allocated to Agent 1
- Item 7: Unallocated
- Item 8: Allocated to Agent 4

Reallocate remaining items:

- **Agent 1**: Assign item 7 (60) since it’s next highest available.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (20) as it’s available.

Now all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 4]
- **Agent 1**: [6, 7]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 2]
- **Agent 3**: [0]
- **Agent 4**: [8]
- **Agent 5**: [5]

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
