Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  80  98  98  88  54   4  59  86
1  30  11  28  44  22  55  26  85  56
2  41  24  89  27  79  23  37  88   5
3  83  29  92  92  75  17  42  75  11
4  87  50  70  61  16  23  39  50  90
5  80  57  79  72  98  62  18  38  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To create a fair division of items among agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where no agent feels envy towards another agent's allocation. One approach to accomplish this is by ensuring that each agent receives items that they highly value, while also attempting to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's examine the table and allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 2 (98) and 3 (98). Let's allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 7 (85). Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (89) but it's already allocated to Agent 0. The next high value for Agent 2 is item 7 (88), but it's allocated to Agent 1. Let's allocate item 0 (41) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (92) and item 3 (92), but both are with Agent 0. Let's allocate item 0 (83) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 8 (90). Let's allocate item 8 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 4 (98). Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 5.

Since we have 3 more items to allocate, let's assign them to ensure a relatively fair distribution:

- Allocate item 5 (62) to Agent 5.
- Allocate item 6 (39) to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 1 (80) to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [0], 
    "4": [8, 6],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes the 9 items among the agents, considering their preferences and aiming to minimize envy among them.
