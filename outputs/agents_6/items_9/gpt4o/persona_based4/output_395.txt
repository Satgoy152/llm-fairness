Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  13  81  13  52  22  29  53  87
1  83  58   3  90   7   2  25  95  14
2  82  15  41  17  11  33  67  79  17
3  38  35  69  86  26  85  99  61  62
4  50  30  80  12  76  45  76  73  40
5  57  54  38  59  74  66  32  10  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One approach to ensure fairness is the Envy-Free (EF) allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations table, let's attempt an allocation that is as fair as possible. We will ensure each agent gets at least one item, given there are 6 agents and 9 items.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 (81) and item 8 (87) highly. Allocate item 8 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 3 (90). Allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 6 (67) and item 7 (79). Allocate item 7 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 6 (99). Allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 4 (76) and item 2 (80). Allocate item 2 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 4 (74) highly. Allocate item 4 to agent 5.

Now, with these high-value items allocated, let's distribute the remaining items to ensure each agent gets at least one item and to make sure the total number of allocations equals 9:

7. **Remaining Items (0, 1, 5)**:
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0, who values it at 40.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 5, who values it at 54.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 4, who values it at 45.

### Final Allocation

Here is the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 5],
    "5": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance high-value items across agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
