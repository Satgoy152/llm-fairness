Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  23  65  97  45  94  77  41  53
1  84   2  59  37   8  58  94   1   9
2  64  86  14   4  33  38  26  18  66
3  56   5   8  88  55  39  56  52  74
4  91  20   4   2  27  22  66   1  46
5  81  82  95  59  23  91  33  84  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider distributing the items in such a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction or total valuation. We will ensure that all 9 items are allocated, with each agent potentially receiving an integer number of items.

Let's walk through a possible allocation that ensures fairness:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation for each item across all agents and try to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction.
2. Consider the distribution of items such that each agent has an opportunity to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5 (valuations: 97, 94)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (valuation: 94)
- Agent 2: Items 1, 8 (valuations: 86, 66)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (valuation: 55)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (valuation: 91)
- Agent 5: Items 2, 7 (valuations: 95, 84)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents such that each agent receives items that they value highly, maximizing overall satisfaction.
