Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  13  68  32   4  94   3  49  11
1  30  33  27  18  12  49  25  10  53
2  65  38  57  58  79  98  24   5  11
3  44  69  48  18  13  36  48  48  35
4  69  36  19  88  29  23  29  91  21
5  19  75  36  46  97  31  19  49  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and that all items are allocated.

Let's use a simple approach to achieve this:

1. For each item, find the agent who values it the most and allocate it to that agent.
2. If any agent ends up with no items, we will reassess and swap items to ensure every agent has at least one item.

Following this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values the most (69)
- Item 1: Agent 5 values the most (75)
- Item 2: Agent 0 values the most (68)
- Item 3: Agent 4 values the most (88)
- Item 4: Agent 5 values the most (97)
- Item 5: Agent 2 values the most (98)
- Item 6: Agent 3 values the most (48)
- Item 7: Agent 4 values the most (91)
- Item 8: Agent 5 values the most (91)

After initial allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [0, 3, 7]
- Agent 5: [1, 4, 8]

Agent 1 has no items, so we need to reallocate one item from an agent with more than one item to Agent 1. We will give Agent 1 item 1 from Agent 5, as it is one of the lower-valued items for Agent 5, who has multiple allocations.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [0, 3, 7]
- Agent 5: [4, 8]

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 3, 7],
    "5": [4, 8]
}
```
