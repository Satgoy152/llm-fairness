Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  46  10  97   0  65  78  90   0
1  79  72   0   8   1  57  52  19  85
2  79   7  54  30  53  98  46  26  23
3  42  94  69  98  22  21  98  10  62
4   3   3  49  87  85  43  56  61  55
5  72  95  95  84  64   4  91  36  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives, keeping in mind that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items need to be allocated. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Step 1: Initial Assignment Based on Highest Value**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Step 2: Review and Adjust**
   - Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's apply this approach to the given valuations.

### Allocation Process

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 79 by agents 1 and 2. Assign to agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 95 by agent 5. Assign to agent 5.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 95 by agent 5. Assign to agent 5.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 98 by agents 0 and 3. Assign to agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 85 by agent 4. Assign to agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 98 by agent 2. Assign to agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 98 by agent 3. Assign to agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 90 by agent 0. Assign to agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 85 by agent 1. Assign to agent 1.

### Final Allocation

After reviewing and ensuring all items are allocated, here is the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every item is distributed and respects the integer allocation constraint for each agent.
