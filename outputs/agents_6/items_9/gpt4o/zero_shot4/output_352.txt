Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  11  49  20  47  33  44  32  31
1  79  93  16  57  35  23  80  65  63
2  73  51  82   9  79  71   2  76  68
3  20  93  41  40  54  34  66  94  11
4  92  65  91  76  78  84  90  90  90
5  40  52  24  96  98   7  91  96  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable value based on their valuations. Here is one way to allocate the items in a manner that tries to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0: Allocated items 0, 8
  - Values: 60, 31
  - Total Value: 91

- Agent 1: Allocated items 1, 6
  - Values: 93, 80
  - Total Value: 173

- Agent 2: Allocated items 2, 4
  - Values: 82, 79
  - Total Value: 161

- Agent 3: Allocated item 7
  - Value: 94
  - Total Value: 94

- Agent 4: Allocated item 5
  - Value: 84
  - Total Value: 84

- Agent 5: Allocated item 3
  - Value: 96
  - Total Value: 96

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item, and some agents get more than one to balance the overall values.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```
