Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  63  84  19  58  89  15  68  42
1  78  71   5  69  71   6  76  64  61
2   0  65  55  75  20  50  62  46  40
3  71  19  99  32   0  65  89  39  49
4   1  86  27  80  32  57  63  72  68
5   6  99   0  55  49  73  80  94  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high value for items 0, 2, and 5.
2. Agent 1 has a high value for items 1, 3, and 4.
3. Agent 2 has a high value for items 3 and 6.
4. Agent 3 has a high value for items 2, 5, and 6.
5. Agent 4 has a high value for items 1, 3, and 7.
6. Agent 5 has a high value for items 1, 7, and 8.

To optimize and ensure each agent gets at least one item, we can distribute the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Items 7, 8

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least some of the items they value highly, and all 9 items are allocated. Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7, 8]
}
```
