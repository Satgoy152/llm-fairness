Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1   9  44  97  58  23  40  98  51
1  16  12  73  89   0  78  80  57  98
2  61  54  63  20  76  70  77  16  58
3  94   5  55  33  61  66  99  61  56
4  11  95  95   9  41  40  64  18  88
5  22  53  25  55  11  61  32  50  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to try to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are given, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of allocated items is exactly 9.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Assign the item with the highest value for this agent, which is item 7 (value 98).
2. Agent 1: Assign the item with the highest value for this agent, which is item 8 (value 98).
3. Agent 2: Assign the item with the highest value for this agent, which is item 6 (value 77).
4. Agent 3: Assign the item with the highest value for this agent, which is item 6 (value 99). Since item 6 is already allocated, assign the second highest, item 0 (value 94).
5. Agent 4: Assign the item with the highest value for this agent, which is item 1 (value 95).
6. Agent 5: Assign the item with the highest value for this agent, which is item 5 (value 61).

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and we need to allocate 3 more to ensure all 9 items are allocated. We'll try to allocate the remaining items based on the next highest available values for each agent:

7. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 97).
8. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 73).
9. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 76).

Now all 9 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [8, 2],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuation of the items, and all items are allocated.
