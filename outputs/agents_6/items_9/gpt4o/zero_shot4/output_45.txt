Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  89  36  30  69  19  23  23  15
1   4  47  42  59  76  31  33  14  27
2  35  24  60  69  54  17   4  99  93
3  47  51  63  18  48  82   6  51  72
4  80  94  58  70  48  43  73  51  83
5  68  64  57  61  95  66  68  91  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A simple approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets a similar number of items if possible.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 88.
2. Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most at 94.
3. Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 63.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 69.
5. Item 4: Agent 5 values it the most at 95.
6. Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most at 82.
7. Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most at 73.
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 99.
9. Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most at 93.

Now let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 3, 7, 8
- Agent 3: Items 2, 5
- Agent 4: Items 1, 6
- Agent 5: Item 4

This allocation ensures that each agent has the highest valuation for the items they receive, and all 9 items are allocated. Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 7, 8],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": [4]
}
```
