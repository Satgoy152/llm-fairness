Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  93  77   6  43  68   1  31   8
1  29  69   8  63  44  68   3  33  70
2  47  91  74  60  26   4   6  51  75
3  73  10  29  18  24  24  97  15  65
4  81  42  62  27  52  34  37  89  21
5   4  40  58   3  15  62  46  66  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should attempt to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
2. Adjust allocations so that all items are assigned, and each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations.

Here's one way to achieve this:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (93).
- Agent 1 values item 8 the most (70).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (91).
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most (97).
- Agent 4 values item 7 the most (89).
- Agent 5 values item 7 the second most (66).

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (93)
- Agent 1: Item 8 (70)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (47)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (97)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (89)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (62)

Now, we need to assign the remaining items 2, 3, and 4. Let's allocate based on remaining highest valuations:

- Agent 2: Item 2 (74)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (52)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (63)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [8, 3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7, 4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
