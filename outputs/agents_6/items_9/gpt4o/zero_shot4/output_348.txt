Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  21   9   6  30  97  67  43  20
1  14  87  89  29  47  91  51  59  18
2  63   0  60  37  56  86  35  41  61
3  56  65  19  59  21  17  35  68  62
4  65  15  90  19  63   3  87  23  25
5  50  30  71  89  31  94  84  67   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple method that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with the allocation, and all items are assigned.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the allocation could be made:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Start by identifying which items have the highest valuations for each agent. This ensures that each agent receives items they value the most.

2. **Assign Items:** Distribute the items based on each agent's highest valuation. If multiple agents value an item highly, assign it to the agent who values it the most. This process continues until all items are allocated.

3. **Check Allocation:** Ensure that all 9 items are distributed and that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 97).
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 89).
- Assign item 8 to agent 2 (value 61).
- Assign item 7 to agent 3 (value 68).
- Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value 87).
- Assign item 3 to agent 5 (value 89).

Now, distribute the remaining items considering the next highest valuations:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 73).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 87).
- Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value 63).

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated.
