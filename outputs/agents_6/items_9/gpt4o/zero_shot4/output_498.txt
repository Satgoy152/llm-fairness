Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  24  99  94  19  61  68  92  69
1  90  19  59  52  17  35  23  59  21
2  88  81  74  88  55  21  87  75  69
3   8  93  91  30  58  43  78  40  49
4  99  59  64   6   4  10  33  32  37
5  66  42  37  13  63  20  59   8  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [66 42 37 13 63 20 59  8 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the constraints, a reasonable approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation per agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item or as evenly distributed as possible.

Let's proceed with allocations based on the given valuations:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each agent.
2. Assign the item with the highest valuation to each agent as a starting point.
3. Distribute remaining items to maximize overall valuation across all agents, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a potential allocation based on these steps:

- Agent 0: Highest value items are 2 (99), 3 (94), and 7 (92)
- Agent 1: Highest value items are 0 (90), 2 (59), and 7 (59)
- Agent 2: Highest value items are 0 (88), 3 (88), and 6 (87)
- Agent 3: Highest value items are 1 (93), 2 (91), and 6 (78)
- Agent 4: Highest value items are 0 (99), 1 (59), and 2 (64)
- Agent 5: Highest value items are 8 (89), 4 (63), and 0 (66)

Allocating the items:

- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 90)
- Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value 93)
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 99)
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 88)
- Assign item 4 to agent 5 (value 63)
- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 61)
- Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 87)
- Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value 92)
- Assign item 8 to agent 5 (value 89)

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item if possible while distributing the remaining items to maximize total valuation.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4, 8]
}
```

This ensures all 9 items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
