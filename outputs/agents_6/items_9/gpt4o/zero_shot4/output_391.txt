Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  40  64  98  80  11  30  66  94
1  45   3  50   0  84  94  49  62   6
2   9  99  51  86  27  44  91  19  71
3  91  77  31   9   4  73  94  42  13
4  63   4  38  99  88  89  77  88  61
5  55  51  76  57  28  25   3  39  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a roughly equal share of their highest-valued items, as much as possible, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has for the items.
2. Allocate items based on these high values, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure that exactly 9 items are distributed among the agents.

Based on this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 8 (valuations: 98, 94)
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5 (valuations: 84, 94)
- Agent 2: Items 1, 6 (valuations: 99, 91)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (valuation: 91)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (valuation: 88)
- Agent 5: Item 2 (valuation: 76)

This allocation considers the highest values each agent has for the items, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2]
}
```
