Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  79  52  58  51  15  74  53  79
1  45   5  75  13  39  79  52  58  52
2  14  94  35  34  45   8  33  65  11
3  91  77  54  60  17  17  88  37  28
4  91  38  76  73  95  60  85  70  59
5  64  53  33  44  22  52  37  74  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45  5 75 13 39 79 52 58 52]
 [14 94 35 34 45  8 33 65 11]

 [64 53 33 44 22 52 37 74 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on the given valuations, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize overall satisfaction. Here's one possible allocation approach:

Identify the highest valuations for each item and allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation.
Ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.
Based on the valuations:

Item 0: Highest valuation by agents 3 and 4 (91). Allocate to agent 3.
Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 2 (94). Allocate to agent 2.
Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 4 (76). Allocate to agent 4.
Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 4 (73). Allocate to agent 4.
Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 4 (95). Allocate to agent 4.
Item 5: Highest valuation by agent 1 (79). Allocate to agent 1.
Item 6: Highest valuation by agent 3 (88). Allocate to agent 3.
Item 7: Highest valuation by agent 5 (74). Allocate to agent 5.
Item 8: Highest valuation by agent 0 and agent 1 (79). Allocate to agent 0.
Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [2, 3, 4],
    "5": [7]
}
```
