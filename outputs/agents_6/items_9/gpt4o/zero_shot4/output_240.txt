Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  28  63  26  45  97  10  92  21
1  90  60  92  12  20  76  86  65  29
2  14  22  97  21   7  62   8  94   0
3  76  72  18   0  17  11  49   2  82
4  23  99  48  61  54  14  16  71  29
5  19  84  82  62  11  88   7   3  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Given there are 6 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others, but we aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction is balanced.

Here's an allocation approach:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent based on their preferences.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, and distribute the remaining items based on maximizing total valuation.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly (97).
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly (92).
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly (97), but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 7 (94).
- Agent 3 values item 8 highly (82).
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly (99).
- Agent 5 values item 8 highly (96), but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 5 (88), but it's taken, so we go with item 2 (82).

After distributing the highest valued items, we continue to allocate remaining items:

- Agent 0 also gets item 0 (83).
- Agent 1 gets item 6 (86).
- Agent 5 gets item 3 (62).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: items 5, 0
- Agent 1: items 2, 6
- Agent 2: item 7
- Agent 3: item 8
- Agent 4: item 1
- Agent 5: item 3

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```
