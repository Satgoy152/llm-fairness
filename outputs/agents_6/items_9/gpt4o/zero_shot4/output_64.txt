Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  11  41  21  91  88  41  98  33
1  43  47  49  89  74  36  68  23  54
2  77  53  98  90  73  29  56  40  15
3  28   2  36  14  65  81  87   8   8
4  42  10  35  85   9  93  18   5  75
5  40  90  58  95  48  82  30  41   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. Given there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item and some may receive none. We'll proceed by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations for each item and assign them one by one to the agent who values them the most:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 78 by agent 0.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 90 by agent 5.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 98 by agent 2.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 95 by agent 5.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 91 by agent 0.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 93 by agent 4.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 87 by agent 3.
8. Item 7: Highest value is 98 by agent 0.
9. Item 8: Highest value is 75 by agent 4.

Now, allocate the items based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 7
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 5, 8
- Agent 5: Items 1, 3

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 8],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```
