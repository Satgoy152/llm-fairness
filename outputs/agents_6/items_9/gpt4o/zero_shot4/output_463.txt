Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  83  16  29  28  47   6  56  49
1  53  59  14  47  24  40  57  95  23
2  55  99   6  29   0   9  70  33  63
3  68   0  55  54   5  14  73  88  72
4   4  98  49  18   7  54  64  19   9
5  99  51  52  95  46  72   8  53   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a roughly equal share of the total value of all items. The total value of all items is calculated by summing all values in the table and then dividing by the number of agents to determine a target value per agent. However, given the constraint of integer allocations, we will focus on distributing items so that each agent receives one or two items while trying to maximize the fairness based on the valuations provided.

1. Calculate the total value of all items and the target value per agent.
2. Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's calculate and allocate:

Total valuations:
```
Agent 0: [78, 83, 16, 29, 28, 47, 6, 56, 49] => Total: 392
Agent 1: [53, 59, 14, 47, 24, 40, 57, 95, 23] => Total: 412
Agent 2: [55, 99, 6, 29, 0, 9, 70, 33, 63] => Total: 364
Agent 3: [68, 0, 55, 54, 5, 14, 73, 88, 72] => Total: 429
Agent 4: [4, 98, 49, 18, 7, 54, 64, 19, 9] => Total: 322
Agent 5: [99, 51, 52, 95, 46, 72, 8, 53, 5] => Total: 481
```

Let's allocate items to maximize each agent's total value:

- Assign item 0 (value 99) to Agent 5
- Assign item 1 (value 98) to Agent 4
- Assign item 2 (value 55) to Agent 3
- Assign item 3 (value 95) to Agent 5
- Assign item 4 (value 46) to Agent 5
- Assign item 5 (value 72) to Agent 5
- Assign item 6 (value 70) to Agent 2
- Assign item 7 (value 95) to Agent 1
- Assign item 8 (value 72) to Agent 3

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
