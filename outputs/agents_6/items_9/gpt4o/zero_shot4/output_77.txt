Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7   7   4  35   5  92  32  60  93
1  96   0  80  63  47  13  45   5  94
2  18  45  36  62  17  98  42  82   0
3   6  22  35  82   3  98  60  93  34
4  28   6   2  91  54  17  48  71   3
5  81  12  43  28  24  72  74  88  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 12 43 28 24 72 74 88 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We will also ensure that all 9 items are allocated. Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Continue assigning items to agents with the next highest valuation until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 high-value items: item 5 (92), item 8 (93)
- Agent 1 high-value items: item 0 (96)
- Agent 2 high-value items: item 5 (98)
- Agent 3 high-value items: item 3 (82)
- Agent 4 high-value items: item 3 (91)
- Agent 5 high-value items: item 0 (81)

To balance and ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [8]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [3, 7]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [1, 2, 6]

Now we have allocated all 9 items. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items according to their valuations while all items are distributed.
