Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  40  29  34  64  37  15  84  10
1  10  94  92  49  70  83  99  69  14
2  23  88  92  32   9  86  30  96  76
3  75  83  33  39  14  14  77   8  93
4  24  56  75   3  84   3  23  25  41
5  89  21   5  93  67  16  99   8  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for every item. We aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of exactly 9 items distributed.

Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 7 the most at 84.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the most at 99.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 7 the most at 96, but it's already allocated, so next highest is item 2 at 92.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 8 the most at 93.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 4 the most at 84.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 6 the most at 99, but it's already allocated, so next highest is item 3 at 93.

Next, allocate remaining items considering the highest remaining valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 0 at 54.
- **Agent 1**: Next highest is item 1 at 94.
- **Agent 2**: Next highest is item 5 at 86.

Now, we have allocated all 9 items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
