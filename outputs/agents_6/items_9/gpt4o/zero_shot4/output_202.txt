Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  68  17  87   1  66  42  44   1
1  37  80  42  15  62  46  89  78  77
2  57   4  96  59  43  91  81  31  21
3  56  59  52  45  21  15   7  89  91
4  55  23  72  13  38  85  16  80  54
5  20  20  79  76  80  34  60  26  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can attempt a strategy where we maximize the total valuation for each agent given the constraints. One common approach is to use a form of the "greedy" algorithm that assigns items to the agent that values them most, iterating through all items until each is allocated.

Here's a potential allocation based on this approach:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 highly (87), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 highly (89), so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly (96), so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 8 highly (91), so we allocate item 8 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 highly (85), so we allocate item 5 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 highly (80), so we allocate item 4 to agent 5.
7. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (79), so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
8. Agent 1 values item 1 highly (80), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
9. Agent 1 values item 7 highly (78), so we allocate item 7 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated exactly once, and no agent receives more items than needed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [6, 1, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```
