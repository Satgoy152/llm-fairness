Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  90  84   8  81  89  34  24  92
1  54  12  86  45  32  38  86  13  59
2  41  58  15  58  31  19  53  64  85
3  70  29  67  19  54   4  30  19  28
4  22  61  74  82  68  24  68  62  80
5  36  16  10  27  58  42   4  51  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table to identify the allocations that maximize each agent's value:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 8.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 6.
3. Agent 2 has high valuation for item 8.
4. Agent 3 has high valuation for item 0.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 8.
6. Agent 5 has high valuation for item 4.

To ensure a fair allocation, we will try to allocate items based on each agent's highest preferences while considering the distribution of items so that each agent gets a reasonable share.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Assign items 0 and 8 to Agent 0, as they have high valuations for these items.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2, as they have a moderate valuation for it.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 3, as they have moderate valuations for them.
- Assign items 5 and 6 to Agent 5, as they have moderate valuations for them.

By this allocation, we ensure that all items are assigned, and each agent gets at least one item. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
