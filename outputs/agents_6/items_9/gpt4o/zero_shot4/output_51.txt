Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  85  87  48  52  71  83  80  33
1  79   4  75  61  82  93  20   0  49
2  13  35  16  32  38  81  30   2   1
3  46  82  78   3  90   6  70  93   1
4  31  30  29  39  48  23  83  34  11
5  84   3  35  68  14  89  11  18  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they receive their most-valued item.
2. Allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (87).
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (93).
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest, but it is already allocated, so we go for the next best, item 3 (32).
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the highest (93).
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (83).
6. Agent 5 values item 0 the highest (84).

After these allocations, the remaining items are 1, 4, and 8. We need to allocate these to the agents who have received fewer items or have lower total value.

- Agent 0 also values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has only one item, so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has only one item, so we allocate item 8 to agent 2.

Now, the allocation is complete with each item assigned to one agent and each agent receiving at least one item.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0]
}
```
