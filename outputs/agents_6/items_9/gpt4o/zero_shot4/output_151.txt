Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  18  39  37  56  77  61  94  96
1  75  28  24  54  50  59  37  57  38
2  60  35  82  85  40  37  14  23  46
3  76  66  95  34  24  93  77  45  99
4  40  81  47  38  40  59  56  41  84
5  10  99   7  48  64   9  40   5  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is balanced as much as possible. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Values are [19, 18, 39, 37, 56, 77, 61, 94, 96]
2. Agent 1: Values are [75, 28, 24, 54, 50, 59, 37, 57, 38]
3. Agent 2: Values are [60, 35, 82, 85, 40, 37, 14, 23, 46]
4. Agent 3: Values are [76, 66, 95, 34, 24, 93, 77, 45, 99]
5. Agent 4: Values are [40, 81, 47, 38, 40, 59, 56, 41, 84]
6. Agent 5: Values are [10, 99, 7, 48, 64, 9, 40, 5, 71]

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 8 (Total valuation: 94 + 96 = 190)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6 (Total valuation: 75 + 37 = 112)
- Agent 2: Items 2 (Total valuation: 82)
- Agent 3: Items 5 (Total valuation: 93)
- Agent 4: Items 1, 4 (Total valuation: 81 + 40 = 121)
- Agent 5: Items 3 (Total valuation: 48)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
