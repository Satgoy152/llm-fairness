Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  17  77  70  43  96  24  86  65
1  47  42  91  54  59  98  75   0  65
2  71   4  15  78   0  44  74  19  80
3  78  74   1  71   2   4  74  84  85
4   0  34  29  65  57  78  82  16  89
5  36  12  92  25  56  15  78  63   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent. We should also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy by considering the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring fair distribution:

- Agent 0 gets items: 5 (96), 0 (87)
- Agent 1 gets items: 2 (91), 5 (98)
- Agent 2 gets items: 8 (80), 3 (78)
- Agent 3 gets items: 7 (84), 8 (85)
- Agent 4 gets items: 8 (89), 6 (82)
- Agent 5 gets items: 2 (92), 6 (78)

After testing a few configurations, the following allocation gives each agent a fair number of items:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [2, 6]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [8]
- Agent 5: [0, 1, 4]

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and each agent has at least one item with a preference towards higher valuation items being allocated to agents with the highest preferences.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
