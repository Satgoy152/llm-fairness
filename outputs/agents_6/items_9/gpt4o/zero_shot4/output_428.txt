Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  47  32  82  74  15  45  17  32
1  69  30  28  52  34  91  80  33  55
2  14  85  83  21  76  71   4  54  92
3  91  26  68  67  62  15  32  52  50
4  56  14  63  76  62  16  49  77  68
5  44   3  91  26  39   3  22  18  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, I'll consider each agent's preference for the items based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation is as fair as possible.

To achieve a fair allocation, I will:

1. Calculate the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Assign one item to each agent based on their highest value.
3. Allocate the remaining items in a way that maximizes the total value for all agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0's highest value is for item 3 (value 82).
2. Agent 1's highest value is for item 5 (value 91).
3. Agent 2's highest value is for item 8 (value 92).
4. Agent 3's highest value is for item 0 (value 91).
5. Agent 4's highest value is for item 3 (value 76), but since item 3 is already taken, we select item 7 (value 77).
6. Agent 5's highest value is for item 2 (value 91).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 1, 4, 6

We'll assign these remaining items using the next highest preferences:

- Agent 0 has a preference for item 0 (already taken), so next highest is item 4 (value 74).
- Agent 1 has a preference for item 0 (already taken), so next highest is item 2 (already taken), then item 8 (already taken), so we look at item 1 (value 30).
- Agent 4 has a preference for item 4 (already taken), so the next highest is item 6 (value 49).

Finally, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7, 6],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.
