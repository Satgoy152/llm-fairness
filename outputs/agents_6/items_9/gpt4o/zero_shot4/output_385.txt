Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25   8  15  55  72  21  82  80  14
1  80  60  27   7  15  48  59  74  31
2  48  57  57  97  92  18  65  50  61
3  32  57  70  64  24   8   8  74  84
4  16  88  45  93  93  64  66  77   6
5   4  79  76  92  61  51  70  28  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [80 60 27  7 15 48 59 74 31]

 [ 4 79 76 92 61 51 70 28 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we'll consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items to maximize fairness while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 8 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 2 the most.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's next highest valuation is for item 7.
- Agent 1's next highest valuation is for item 1.
- Agent 5's next highest valuation is for item 5.

This allocation uses all items and considers each agent's highest-valued items to ensure fairness.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
