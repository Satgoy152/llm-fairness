Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  96  32  70  49  53   8  54  14
1   0  55  69   4  37  88  29  85  56
2  75  53  26  34  79  92  25  51  84
3  69  44  46  32   2  28  11  25  44
4  38  58   3   0  51  90  31  49  79
5  11  96  98  89  93  32   1  82  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by ensuring each agent gets some of the items they value the most. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 1 the most, followed by item 3.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 the most, followed by item 7.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 the most, but since it's already taken by Agent 1, the next highest value is item 8.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 the most.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 5 the most, but since it's already taken, the next highest value is item 8, which is taken, so we go for item 7.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 2 the most.

The remaining items can be allocated to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1

Here's a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [8, 3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 9.
