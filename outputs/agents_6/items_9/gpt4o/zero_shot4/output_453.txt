Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  45  45  45  62  49  63  79  30
1  92   8  49   8  83  71  80  19  46
2  75  74  53  77  99  10  44  57  47
3  88  61  33  49  49  16  36  73  89
4   8  33  17  77   8  98  49  32  20
5  94  14  58  72  36  94  27  41  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This method ensures that each agent gets the items they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Here is the allocation based on the highest valuations:

- Item 0: Highest value is 94 by agent 5.
- Item 1: Highest value is 74 by agent 2.
- Item 2: Highest value is 58 by agent 5.
- Item 3: Highest value is 77 by agents 2 and 4 (choose agent 2).
- Item 4: Highest value is 99 by agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest value is 98 by agent 4.
- Item 6: Highest value is 80 by agent 1.
- Item 7: Highest value is 79 by agent 0.
- Item 8: Highest value is 89 by agent 3.

Now, let's allocate these items to the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring all 9 items are allocated.
