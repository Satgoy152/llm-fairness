Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  97  53  43  85   2  13  15  45
1  91  43   8   7  97  48  57  54  95
2  27  28  26  72  44  37  49  38  53
3  46  24  93  20  43  65  97  13  61
4  51  26  35  84  34  24  13  93  78
5  47  28  21  90  11  90  20   5   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can consider a strategy to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. We will aim to distribute the items such that the allocation is as balanced as possible, considering the preferences of agents as represented by their valuations.

Let's start by giving each agent at least one item where possible, and then adjust so that all 9 items are distributed.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1, as it is their highest value.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4, as it is their highest value.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3, as it is their highest value.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6, as it is their highest value.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 7, as it is their highest value.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 5, as it is their highest value.

At this point, each agent has received one item, and we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 3 more items. We'll need to find a balance between their remaining high-value preferences.

7. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0, as it is their next highest value.
8. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 8, as it is their next highest value.
9. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 2, as it is their next highest value.

Now, all 9 items have been allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed, ensuring no agent is left out and no item is unallocated.
