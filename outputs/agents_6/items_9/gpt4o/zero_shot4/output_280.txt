Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  92  41  65  58   3  95  52   1
1  90  70  23  29  76  30  33  46  68
2  44  20  52  98  70   1  23  68  63
3  56  89  42   7  88  51  14  79  33
4  26  75  38  60  54  10  47  78  70
5  98  60  69   2  72  19  86  80  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 60 69  2 72 19 86 80 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total allocation equals the number of items available, which is 9. One approach is to assign items based on which agent values them the most, ensuring each agent gets some items, if possible, and the total number of items equals 9.

Let's look at the table and assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0 is most valued by agent 5 with a value of 98.
- Item 1 is most valued by agent 0 with a value of 92.
- Item 2 is most valued by agent 5 with a value of 69.
- Item 3 is most valued by agent 2 with a value of 98.
- Item 4 is most valued by agent 3 with a value of 88.
- Item 5 is most valued by agent 0 with a value of 3.
- Item 6 is most valued by agent 0 with a value of 95.
- Item 7 is most valued by agent 5 with a value of 80.
- Item 8 is most valued by agent 4 with a value of 70.

Now let's distribute these items to the agents:

- Agent 0: [1, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [8]
- Agent 5: [0, 2, 7]

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0, 2, 7]
}
```
