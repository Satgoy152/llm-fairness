Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  75  82  34  71  25  33  85  83
1  16  78  13  14   0  74  16  19  88
2  17  31  65   7  25  12  10   4  46
3   9  19  55  38  75  76  19  96  28
4  22  69  95  18  71   0  73  42  81
5  13  57  35  96  69  17  77   6  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's prioritize giving items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

To do this, we can use a simple greedy algorithm:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Continue until all items have been allocated.

Here's how the allocation works for this problem:

- Item 0: The highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 22.
- Item 1: The highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 75.
- Item 2: The highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 95.
- Item 3: The highest valuation is by agent 5 with a value of 96.
- Item 4: The highest valuation is by agent 3 with a value of 75.
- Item 5: The highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 74.
- Item 6: The highest valuation is by agent 5 with a value of 77.
- Item 7: The highest valuation is by agent 3 with a value of 96.
- Item 8: The highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 88.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [0, 2],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned and has been allocated to the agent who values it the most.
