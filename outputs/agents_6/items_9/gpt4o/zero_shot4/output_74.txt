Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  96  33  32  51  15  83  76  35
1  56  96  14  88  13  57   5  57  86
2  63  69  38  41  96  80  78  79  47
3  57  10  11  97  32  96  42  88  72
4  89  89  91  55  78  25  18   5  36
5  96  33  85  47  50  47  92   1  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item until all 9 items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 1 and 6.
2. Agent 1 has a high value for item 3.
3. Agent 2 has a high value for item 4.
4. Agent 3 has a high value for items 3 and 5.
5. Agent 4 has high values for items 0 and 2.
6. Agent 5 has a high value for item 0.

Let's ensure that each agent is allocated at least one item and all items are allocated:

- Allocate items to maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here is one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, aiming to maximize their valuations.
