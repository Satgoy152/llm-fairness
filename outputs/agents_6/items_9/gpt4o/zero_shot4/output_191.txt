Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  57  33   2   6   9  63  63  67
1   4  35  44  31  90  77   0   1  75
2  32   5  87  49  93  30  95  51  88
3  84  47  62  74  41  63  89  24  38
4  80  95  34  94  83   1   0  69  90
5  80  66  41  32  24   2  34  82  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the matrix, we aim to assign items to agents such that the total of allocated items is exactly 9, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring no agent gets more than a fair number of items if possible.
2. Try to balance the allocation so each agent has at least one item if possible.

Let's evaluate the table and assign the items:

- Assign item 0 to agent 3 (value 84).
- Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 95).
- Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 87).
- Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value 94).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 90).
- Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 63).
- Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 95).
- Assign item 7 to agent 5 (value 82).
- Assign item 8 to agent 0 (value 67).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [1, 3],
    "5": [7]
}
```
