Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  11  78  36  98  76  81  13  68
1  29  20  47  87  44  68  12  42  83
2  87  37  79  37  88  72  83  99  63
3  71  54  68  37  43  94  88  88   2
4  75  76  82  34  17   3  99  96  91
5  70  16  99  13  11  31  73  30  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value of the items, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives approximately the same number of items.

Here’s a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on maximizing the total value for each agent.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.
4. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives approximately the same number of items.

Following these steps, here’s a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 6 agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
