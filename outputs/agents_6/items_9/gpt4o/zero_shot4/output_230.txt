Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  54  95   0   3  45  59   8   5
1  15  18  38  26  69  70  33  71  76
2  47  26  61  81  82  63  95  74   4
3  14  21  72  99  12  93  11  67  41
4  23  64  36  48  70  69  40  14  63
5   0  69  29   6  79  92  79   0  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0 since it has the highest value for them.
2. Assign item 8 to agent 1 as it holds the highest value for them.
3. Assign item 6 to agent 2 as it holds the highest value for them.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 since it has the highest value for them.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 5 as it holds the highest value for them.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 3 since it has a high value and agent 3 can take another item.
7. Assign item 1 to agent 5 due to the high value.
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 as agent 1 can take another item.
9. Assign item 0 to agent 2 since it has a significant value and completes the distribution.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [8, 7],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
