Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89   7  34  22  38   7  30  87  38
1  64  39  72  43  31  98  64   7  37
2  81  91  90  75  41  28   9  56  84
3  56  57  18   5  43  38  40   7  21
4  78  70  97  34  16  40  22  45  41
5  75  36   3  90  27  91  90  87  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value received by each agent. A possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Item 0: The highest value is 89 by agent 0.
2. Item 1: The highest value is 91 by agent 2.
3. Item 2: The highest value is 97 by agent 4.
4. Item 3: The highest value is 90 by agent 5.
5. Item 4: The highest value is 43 by agent 3.
6. Item 5: The highest value is 98 by agent 1.
7. Item 6: The highest value is 90 by agent 5.
8. Item 7: The highest value is 87 by agent 0.
9. Item 8: The highest value is 84 by agent 2.

The allocation can be represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item or a fair number based on their highest valued items.
