Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  46  73  86  35  33  26  39  66
1  40  43  29  86  75  61  12  84  41
2  73   8  10  62  43  66  51  78  66
3  29  28  61  86  31  42  93  57  64
4  67  63  88  70  11  98  81  96  80
5  37  30  55  26  47  60  35  29  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of allocated items equals 9. Here is one approach to ensure a fair distribution:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Distribute items such that each agent receives items they value highly.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and make allocations based on these values:

- Agent 0: 85 + 46 + 73 + 86 + 35 + 33 + 26 + 39 + 66 = 489
- Agent 1: 40 + 43 + 29 + 86 + 75 + 61 + 12 + 84 + 41 = 471
- Agent 2: 73 + 8 + 10 + 62 + 43 + 66 + 51 + 78 + 66 = 457
- Agent 3: 29 + 28 + 61 + 86 + 31 + 42 + 93 + 57 + 64 = 491
- Agent 4: 67 + 63 + 88 + 70 + 11 + 98 + 81 + 96 + 80 = 654
- Agent 5: 37 + 30 + 55 + 26 + 47 + 60 + 35 + 29 + 34 = 353

Given these total valuations, we can now make the allocations:

- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for items, followed by Agent 3, Agent 0, Agent 1, Agent 2, and finally Agent 5. 
- Let's allocate items based on the agents' highest individual valuations for specific items.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [4, 7]
- Agent 2: [5, 8]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [1]

This allocation ensures that every agent gets at least one item and reflects each agent's highest values for specific items. 

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```
