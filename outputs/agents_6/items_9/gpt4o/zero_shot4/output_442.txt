Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  54  23  44  58  71  22  31  37
1  45  27  51  98   2  14  63  14  17
2  12  55  69  20  13  88   2  45  55
3  10  46  75   2  37  85   7  34  66
4  25  10  68  83  69  93  15  63  27
5  34  69  79  67  26  58  71  74   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items is exactly 9.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 45.
- Item 1: Agent 5 values it the most at 69.
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most at 79.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 58.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most at 93.
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most at 71.
- Item 7: Agent 5 values it the most at 74.
- Item 8: Agent 3 values it the most at 66.

Now, let's ensure that each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [8]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [1, 2, 6, 7]

Agent 2 currently has no items. We can adjust the allocation by giving one of the items assigned to Agent 5 to Agent 2.

After adjusting, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [8]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [2, 6, 7]

Now, each agent has at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 9.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 6, 7]
}
```
