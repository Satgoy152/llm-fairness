Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  34  80  92  98  49   0  32  22
1  35  73  61  38  87  45  33  43   5
2  71  94  59  37  92  43  94  44  95
3  57  47  19  96  66  21  15  70  15
4  51  92  80  97  68  69  91  59  22
5   2  28  30  81   4  26  36  40  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each of the 9 items is assigned to exactly one agent. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items. This can help gauge each agent's preferences.

2. Allocate items iteratively, ensuring a balanced distribution of high-value items across agents.

3. Aim to assign each agent items for which they have relatively higher valuations and distribute the remaining items while keeping balance in mind.

Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 3: Item [3]
- Agent 4: Item [7]
- Agent 5: Item [5]

This allocation attempts to consider each agent's valuations and distributes the items in a manner that balances the agents' total values.

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```
