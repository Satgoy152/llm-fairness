Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  93   6  42  18   6  60  59  23
1  10  64  17  17  53  48  36  56  14
2  49  61  80  24  29  86  39  16  87
3  79  27  37  44  16  99  73  73  25
4  10  20  30  30  40  47  59  21  47
5  63  53  38  39  47   7  16  79   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we can aim to distribute items in such a way that each agent gets a fair share of the total value, based on their individual preferences. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, not all agents will receive the same number of items, but we will ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values items highly at indices 0, 1, and 6. We'll allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has relatively higher valuations for items 1, 4, and 7. We'll allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most, and also item 8. We'll allocate items 5 and 8 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most, but it's taken. Item 6 is also highly valued by this agent. We'll allocate items 6 and 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** doesn't have exceptionally high values compared to others, but item 2 is one of the higher values for them. We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 7 the most. We'll allocate item 7 to Agent 5.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents while attempting to respect their valuations.
