Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  29   3  17  65   1  59  58  95
1  66  78  26  87  17  44  69  98  37
2  32  42  77  32  99  52  43  51  53
3  12  44  65  55  76  94  41  20  61
4  36  37   2  11  75  10  31  39  90
5  89  83  31  70  63  28  89  12  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [89 83 31 70 63 28 89 12 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we can look at maximizing the total valuation each agent gets from the items they receive. We should ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 5 (value: 89)
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value: 78)
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value: 77)
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value: 87)
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value: 99)
6. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value: 94)
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value: 59)
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 (value: 98)
9. Assign item 8 to agent 5 (value: 97)

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to exactly one agent, and every agent receives an integer number of items. Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 8]
}
```
