Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  58  76  31   3  83   8  42  63
1  48  11  37  95  71  41  39  75  78
2  49  39  22  63  45  24  34   5   9
3  14  24  10   6  90  69  12  50  36
4  51  98  64  15  55  80  16  78   2
5  94  56  13  38  22   2  67  49  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that considers the highest value each agent places on the items, ensuring that each item is allocated and all agents have a fair chance to receive items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value each agent places on any item and attempt to allocate that item to the respective agent.
2. If multiple agents value an item equally high, assign it to any of those agents based on remaining items or values.
3. Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation based on the table provided:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (83).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (95).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the second highest (63), but it's already allocated, so we consider his next highest, item 0 (49).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (90).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (98).
- Agent 5 values item 0 the highest (94), but it's already allocated, so we consider his next highest, item 6 (67).

Continue this process until all items are allocated, ensuring no agent receives more than one item until all have at least one, then distribute the remaining items if necessary.

Here is a json format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "0": [7],
    "1": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated. Adjustments were made to ensure all items are distributed fairly, considering each agent's highest valuation on unallocated items.
