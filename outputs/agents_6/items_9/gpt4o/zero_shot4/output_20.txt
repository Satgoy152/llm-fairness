Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  94  51  43  13   0  55  47  94
1  74  49  41  58  97  12  26  12  47
2  95  99  35  88  26  90  31  62   0
3  17  78  40  84  30  22  53  37  67
4  56  95  24  13  18  31  33  44  13
5  16  47  24  63  75  20  81  27  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item. We will aim to balance the value that each agent receives as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and create a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0** values items: 0 (97), 1 (94), 8 (94).
2. **Agent 1** values item: 4 (97).
3. **Agent 2** values items: 1 (99), 5 (90).
4. **Agent 3** values item: 3 (84).
5. **Agent 4** values item: 1 (95).
6. **Agent 5** values item: 6 (81).

To ensure fairness and that each agent gets an item they highly value (if possible):

- **Agent 0** should get item 0.
- **Agent 1** should get item 4.
- **Agent 2** should get item 1.
- **Agent 3** should get item 3.
- **Agent 4** should get item 8.
- **Agent 5** should get item 6.

Now, we have assigned 6 items, and there are 3 items left (2, 5, 7). We will assign these based on the next highest values:

- **Agent 0** can also take item 2 (51).
- **Agent 2** can take item 5 (90).
- **Agent 3** can take item 7 (37).

Now, all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations.
