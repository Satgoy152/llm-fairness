Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44   3  14  48  72  66  47  30  79
1  17  98  49  89  82  59  16  50  10
2  58  60  71  37  85  61  19  15   2
3  88  78  13  64  66  52  64  51  78
4  75  83  18  95  97  24  49  34  81
5  65  95  78  96  56  84  48  62  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations of the items. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, one way to allocate is to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the remaining items can be given based on the highest valuations.

Let's work through the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Items with highest valuations - 8 (79), 4 (72)
2. **Agent 1**: Item with highest valuation - 1 (98)
3. **Agent 2**: Item with highest valuation - 4 (85)
4. **Agent 3**: Item with highest valuation - 0 (88)
5. **Agent 4**: Item with highest valuation - 4 (97) - already allocated, so next highest - 3 (95)
6. **Agent 5**: Item with highest valuation - 3 (96) - already allocated, next highest - 1 (95) - already allocated, next highest - 5 (84)

Now we need to ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 8, 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 0 (since 3 is taken by Agent 4)
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Items 2, 5, 7 

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
