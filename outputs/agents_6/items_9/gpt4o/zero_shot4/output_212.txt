Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23   0   8   5  82  19   2  84  67
1  46  33  70  28  17  37   4  91  48
2   5  88  55  24  53  85   7  49  91
3  51  92  77  98  93  57  57  10  79
4  28  97  53   8  63  17  91   8  53
5  46  78  71   3  86  47  60   1  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally receive at least one item, with three agents receiving two items to ensure all items are allocated.

One approach is to allow each agent to receive the item they value the most, and then adjust to ensure all items are allocated. Let's proceed with this allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0: Highest value is for item 7 (value 84).
2. Agent 1: Highest value is for item 7 (value 91), but since agent 0 claims item 7, the next highest is item 2 (value 70).
3. Agent 2: Highest value is for item 8 (value 91).
4. Agent 3: Highest value is for item 3 (value 98).
5. Agent 4: Highest value is for item 1 (value 97).
6. Agent 5: Highest value is for item 8 (value 95), but since agent 2 claims item 8, the next highest is item 4 (value 86).

Now we assign the remaining items by considering each agent's next highest preference:

- Agent 0 has item 7. Next highest available is item 4 (value 82).
- Agent 1 has item 2. Next highest available is item 5 (value 37).
- Agent 2 has item 8. Next highest available is item 5 (value 85), but since that is claimed by agent 1, the next available is item 0 (value 5).
- Agent 3 has item 3. Next highest available is item 4 (value 93), but since that is claimed by agent 0, the next available is item 5 (value 57), but since that is claimed by agent 1, the next available is item 6 (value 57).
- Agent 4 has item 1. Next highest available is item 5 (value 17), but since that is claimed by agent 1, the next available is item 6 (value 91), but since that is claimed by agent 3, the next available is item 0 (value 28), but since that is claimed by agent 2, the next available is item 3 (value 8), but since that is claimed by agent 3, the next available is item 4 (value 63).
- Agent 5 has item 4. Next highest available is item 0 (value 46), but since that is claimed by agent 2, the next available is item 1 (value 78), but since that is claimed by agent 4, the next available is item 3 (value 3), but since that is claimed by agent 3, the next available is item 5 (value 47), but since that is claimed by agent 1, the next available is item 6 (value 60), but since that is claimed by agent 3, the next available is item 7 (value 1), but since that is claimed by agent 0, the next available is item 8 (value 95), but since that is claimed by agent 2, the next available is item 9 (which doesn't exist).

Let's refine the allocation strategy to ensure each agent receives at least one item:
- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [8]
- Agent 3: [3, 6]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [4, 0]

Now we have used all 9 items and each agent has received at least one item. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 0]
}
```
