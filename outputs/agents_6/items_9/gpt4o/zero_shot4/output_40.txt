Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  47  90  69   8  24   4  13  86
1  82  86  78  48  89  28  73  23  93
2  46  94  90  51  15  25  63  18  82
3  33  73  28  32  42  51  75  73  38
4  54  13  92  96  85  93  47  66  69
5  98  58  86  53  85   4  93  28  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair number of items, taking into account their valuations. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally receive at least one item, with some agents receiving one extra item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step 1: Initial Allocation
- Since there are 6 agents and 9 items, we can start by allocating one item to each agent.

### Step 2: Additional Allocations
- After the initial allocation, we will have 3 items left to allocate, which will go to the agents with the highest remaining valuations.

### Allocation Process:
1. Sort the items based on each agent's valuation and pick the highest for each agent initially.
2. Allocate the remaining items to the agents where their next highest valuations are the largest.

Following this process, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 (highest value 90).
- Agent 1 gets item 8 (highest value 93).
- Agent 2 gets item 1 (highest value 94).
- Agent 3 gets item 6 (highest value 75).
- Agent 4 gets item 5 (highest value 93).
- Agent 5 gets item 0 (highest value 98).

Now we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items:

- Based on remaining valuations:
  - Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 89).
  - Agent 5 gets item 8 (value 98).
  - Agent 4 gets item 3 (value 96).

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [8, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 3],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the extra items are distributed to those with the highest valuations for those items.
