Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  54  73  95  11  53  60  50  72
1  31  37  25  83  39  74  91  94  72
2   8  17  31  78  29  46  51  92  23
3  25  68  77  81  99  28  92  87  21
4  83  38  24  10  55  59  69  46   5
5  69  66  64  90  58   5  46  35  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can follow a simple greedy algorithm where each agent will pick the item they value the most, and we repeat this process until all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 3 (value 95)
   - Allocation: [3]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 7 (value 94)
   - Allocation: [7]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 7 (value 92), but it’s already taken.
   - Next highest value: Item 3 (value 78), but it’s already taken.
   - Next highest value: Item 6 (value 51)
   - Allocation: [6]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: Item 4 (value 99)
   - Allocation: [4]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (value 83)
   - Allocation: [0]

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest value: Item 3 (value 90), but it’s already taken.
   - Next highest value: Item 0 (value 69), but it’s already taken.
   - Next highest value: Item 1 (value 66)
   - Allocation: [1]

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 2, 5, 8.

7. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest value: Item 2 (value 73)
   - Allocation: [3, 2]

8. **Agent 1**:
   - Next highest value: Item 5 (value 74)
   - Allocation: [7, 5]

9. **Agent 3**:
   - Next highest value: Item 8 (value 21)
   - Allocation: [4, 8]

Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations.
