Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  26  29  82  56  40  58  67  16
1  56  96  30  95   3  32  16  21  71
2  78  68  61  50  37  31  80  91  99
3  61   5   4  18  68   0  29  53  34
4  58  78  98  23  42  74  63  62  84
5  65  71  38  82  33  43  26  17  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's values for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Given that there are 6 agents and 9 items, it's not possible to give each agent an equal number of items, but we can try to distribute them as equitably as possible. Here is one approach to allocating the items:

1. Assign items based on each agent's highest valuation for an item that has not yet been allocated.
2. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 96, so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 8 the highest at 99, so assign item 8 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3's highest valuation is for item 4 at 68, so assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the highest at 98, so assign item 2 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the highest at 65, so assign item 0 to Agent 5.
- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 82, so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Now we distribute the remaining items: 
  - The next highest unallocated value for Agent 5 is item 5 at 43, so assign item 5 to Agent 5.
  - The next highest unallocated value for Agent 1 is item 7 at 21, so assign item 7 to Agent 1.
  - Finally, the next highest unallocated value for Agent 2 is item 6 at 80, so assign item 6 to Agent 2.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [8, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```
