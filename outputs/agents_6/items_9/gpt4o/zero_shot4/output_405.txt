Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  86   0  41  49  50  47  33  30
1  12  57  48  20   0  22  63  12  53
2  76  61  94  77  39  36  58  68  54
3  61  72  23  44  82  52  52  71  48
4  75  61   9  19  48  33  41  26  34
5  96  15   3  94  16  94   9  92  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a roughly equal share based on their valuations. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, we'll start by aiming to give each agent at least 1 item, with a couple of agents receiving an additional item to reach the total of 9 items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: We'll assign items that have high values for Agent 0.
2. Agent 1: We'll do the same, considering Agent 1's highest valuations.
3. Agent 2: We'll assign items based on high value for Agent 2.
4. Agent 3: We'll select items with high value for Agent 3.
5. Agent 4: We'll allocate items with Agent 4's higher valuations in mind.
6. Agent 5: We'll assign items with high value for Agent 5.

By doing this, we ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (value 86)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (value 48)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (value 76), Item 8 (value 54)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (value 82)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (value 41)
- Agent 5: Item 3 (value 94), Item 5 (value 94), Item 7 (value 92)

Now we have allocated all 9 items among the 6 agents.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.
