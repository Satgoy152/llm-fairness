Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  67  99  13  68  46  60  52   6
1  61   0  78  92  33  77   4  37  47
2  85  80   1  54  81  58  79  74   9
3  86  29  16  45   7  42  57  83   5
4  83  35  21  16  16  56  35  18  60
5  48  80  52  64   6  76  22  68  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's preferences are considered as evenly as possible. A simple approach is to assign each agent one item based on their highest valuation, then repeat the process until all items are allocated. Here is how it can be done:

1. Start by selecting the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. If there are conflicts (i.e., multiple agents value the same item the highest), resolve by considering the next highest available item for one of the conflicting agents.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Following these steps, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0's highest preference is item 2 (value 99).
- Agent 1's highest preference is item 3 (value 92).
- Agent 2's highest preference is item 4 (value 81).
- Agent 3's highest preference is item 0 (value 86).
- Agent 4's highest preference is item 8 (value 60).
- Agent 5's highest preference is item 1 (value 80).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining three items (5, 6, and 7):

- Agent 0's next highest preference is item 1 (value 67), but it is already taken. So, we give them item 5 (value 46).
- Agent 1's next highest preference is item 5 (value 77), but it is already taken. So, we give them item 7 (value 37).
- Agent 2's next highest preference is item 6 (value 79), which is still available.

This way, all items are allocated fairly considering agents' preferences.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1]
}
```
