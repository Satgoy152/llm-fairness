Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  11  17  34  75  10  52   2  68
1  38  17   6  53  50  83  59  31  68
2  56  14  31   8  58  56  99  40  35
3  57  56  54  90  43  57  27   8  49
4  59  74  91  78   5  58  89  30   4
5  96  44  34  21  67  51  39  23  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. One way to approach this problem is to assign items to agents such that each agent has a relatively balanced sum of valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's propose an allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent.
2. Allocate items one by one, starting with the agent that currently has the least total value assigned, to ensure a fair distribution.

Here's an allocation that balances the total valuations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5] (54 + 10 = 64)
- Agent 1: Items [1, 6] (17 + 59 = 76)
- Agent 2: Items [4] (58)
- Agent 3: Items [3, 8] (90 + 49 = 139)
- Agent 4: Items [2] (91)
- Agent 5: Item [7] (23)

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7]
}
```
