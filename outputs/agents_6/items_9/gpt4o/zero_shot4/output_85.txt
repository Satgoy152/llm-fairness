Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50   2  19  96  29  14  78  51  62
1  71  30  11  28   5  64  46  14  33
2  91  47   2  42  98  12  96  64   8
3  28  80  44  25  20  27  62  34  82
4  22  95  25   2  13  46  53   2  34
5  60  64  54  48  82  42  97  62   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. We'll aim for a distribution where each agent gets a similar total value based on their individual valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (96), item 6 (78), and item 0 (50).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (71), item 5 (64), and item 6 (46).
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 (98), item 6 (96), and item 0 (91).
- Agent 3 highly values item 1 (80), item 8 (82).
- Agent 4 highly values item 1 (95).
- Agent 5 highly values item 6 (97), item 4 (82), and item 0 (60).

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [4, 7]
- Agent 3: [1, 8]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [0, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item that they value highly, while all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```
