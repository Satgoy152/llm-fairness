Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  74  68  39  63  76  44  91  45
1  34  70  68  53  13   8  42  15  58
2  18  44  14  80  82  61  43  88   3
3  44  76  13  50  20  52  15  76  72
4  18  62  81  23  70  94  60   1  29
5  76  61  66  23  35  54  79  77  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent if possible, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
2. Continue the allocation by considering the next highest valued items for agents who have received fewer items, while ensuring that each item is allocated only once.

Below is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items like 0, 1, 7.
- Agent 1 values items 1, 2, 8.
- Agent 2 values items 3, 4, 7.
- Agent 3 values items 1, 3, 7.
- Agent 4 values items 2, 5, 6.
- Agent 5 values items 0, 5, 6.

Let's distribute the items:

- Give item 0 to Agent 0 (valued at 99).
- Give item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 70).
- Give item 2 to Agent 4 (valued at 81).
- Give item 3 to Agent 2 (valued at 80).
- Give item 4 to Agent 2 (valued at 82).
- Give item 5 to Agent 4 (valued at 94).
- Give item 6 to Agent 5 (valued at 79).
- Give item 7 to Agent 0 (valued at 91).
- Give item 8 to Agent 3 (valued at 72).

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [2, 5],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents, with each agent getting at least one item, optimizing based on their valuations.
