Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  70   1  86   9  39  91  12  32
1  13  31  15  70  51  59  77   7  35
2  70  27  30  36  44  19  11  60  36
3  69  16  24  64  30  97  79   2  84
4  95  12  89  83  21  97  98   4  85
5  94   6  12  57  26  58  19  97  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable total value, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 highly, so it makes sense to allocate item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly, so it makes sense to allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 highly, so it makes sense to allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly, so it makes sense to allocate item 5 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly, so it makes sense to allocate item 4 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 7 highly, so it makes sense to allocate item 7 to agent 5.

Now we have allocated one item to each agent, and we need to allocate the remaining 3 items (1, 2, and 8) in a manner that maintains fairness.

- Agent 0 has a decent valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly, so allocate item 2 to agent 4.
- Agent 3 values item 8 highly, so allocate item 8 to agent 3.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives items based on their valuation preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 8],
    "4": [4, 2],
    "5": [7]
}
```
