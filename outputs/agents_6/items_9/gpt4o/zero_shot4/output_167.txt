Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  15  12  68   0  40  35  31  84
1  44  82  49  34  18  84  81  91  80
2  81  23  92   7  78  51  98  99   9
3  14  91  64  80  82  77  96  65   4
4  95  30  39   5  60  96  71  93  22
5   2  10  81  63   8  54  42  46  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a manner that balances the total value each agent receives. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but we will attempt to ensure that each agent's total value is as balanced as possible. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 8
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 5
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 6
- Agent 3: Items 3 and 7
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: No items

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Value = 57 + 84 = 141
- Agent 1: Value = 82 + 84 = 166
- Agent 2: Value = 92 + 98 = 190
- Agent 3: Value = 80 + 65 = 145
- Agent 4: Value = 60
- Agent 5: Value = 0

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value while ensuring all items are distributed.
