Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19   6  75  81  78  30  92  38  30
1  82   3  96  68  59  65  86  21  52
2  25  84  79  17  54  39   0   8  67
3  41   2  29  90  82  69  38  32  92
4  23  56  92  21  71  34  89  42  14
5  72  93  33  49  26  67   4  48  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we will aim to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the distribution considers the preferences of the agents based on their valuations. A possible approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. After considering the valuations, here is one possible allocation:

Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 92).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 96).
- Agent 2 gets item 1 (value 84).
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (value 90).
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (value 71).
- Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 67).
- Agent 3 also gets item 8 (value 92).
- Agent 0 also gets item 0 (value 19).
- Agent 4 also gets item 7 (value 42).

With these allocations, each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [5]
}
```
