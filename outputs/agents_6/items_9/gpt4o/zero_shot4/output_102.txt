Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  95  20  20  55  39  57  72  66
1  45  89  63  39  13  22  13  83  71
2  85  11  49  74  55  76  98   8  82
3  15  59  55  30  12  24  84  80  69
4  89  35  61  46  62  17  89  74  52
5  38  80  14  71  34  33  47   6  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuation of the items. A possible approach is to ensure each agent gets the items they value the most while trying to balance the total value for each agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent**: Start by noting the highest value item for each agent and try to allocate these first, provided no two agents have the same item as their highest value or within their top preferences.

2. **Allocate items based on preferences**: Allocate items to each agent based on their preference, taking care not to exceed the total number of items.

Below is a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most, so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly too, but since it's already allocated, assign the next highest available value item, which is item 7.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most, so allocate item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly as well, but since it's already allocated, assign item 7 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most, so allocate item 0 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 8 the most, so allocate item 8 to agent 5.

Reevaluate the remaining items and allocate them to agents with the next highest values in the remaining items:

- Allocate item 2 to agent 3, as it has a high value for them.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 5, as it provides a reasonable value.
- Allocate item 4 to agent 4, as it provides a reasonable value.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 4],
    "5": [8, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least some items they value highly, while distributing the items fairly. Note that each agent's allocation might not use their top-valued items if those items are better suited to others based on overall fairness and value distribution.
