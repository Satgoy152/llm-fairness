Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  54  75  28  86  95  85   4  54
1  52  75   6  89  23  42   1  35  75
2  11  62  30  12  51  71   6  91  42
3  52  35  10  22  88  48  30  32  40
4  27  21  96  43  79  71  14  64  57
5  30  82  59  13  40  88  62  97   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them as evenly as possible. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Start by identifying the items that have the highest valuation for any agent, and allocate those items to the respective agents.
2. Proceed to allocate the remaining items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible, while considering the agents' valuations to maintain fairness.
3. Ensure that all 9 items are distributed among the agents.

Following this method, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5 and 4.
- Agent 1 highly values item 3.
- Agent 2 highly values item 7.
- Agent 3 highly values item 4.
- Agent 4 highly values item 2.
- Agent 5 highly values item 7.

To ensure each agent gets at least one item and to distribute all items, we can use the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [8, 6, 4]
}
```

In this distribution, each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. This approach considers the highest preferences while ensuring fairness in distribution.
