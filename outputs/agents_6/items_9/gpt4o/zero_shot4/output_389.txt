Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  77  12  42  21   9  91  84  99
1  73  68   9  75  27  67  34  75  61
2  81  33  94   6  87   1  21  67  44
3  35  84   1  19  99  63   8  41  86
4  53  64  53   7  37  68  66  75  65
5  40  98  40  91   5  65  65  38  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items such that the allocations are as balanced as possible, with each agent ideally receiving at least one item and maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Allocate the highest valued item to each agent first to ensure fairness.
2. Distribute remaining items considering the next best value for each agent.

Let's perform an allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 8.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 5.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 1.

Remaining items to allocate: 0, 6, 7.

- Agent 0 also values item 6 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 7 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on the highest valuations.
