Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  24   1  87   2  91  18  64  48
1  50  98  25  73   4  42  30  29  17
2  47  22  66  64  53  77  27  54  23
3  34  38  63   8  57  54  54  38  26
4  39  33  57  16  74  82  43  62  91
5  25  70  70  80  89  13  90  15  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. However, since each agent has different valuations for each item, an optimal distribution might not exist that satisfies every agent equally. Instead, we aim for a balanced distribution. 

Below is one possible allocation that ensures each agent receives items while considering their preferences:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 8 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly.

Distributing the remaining items: 

- Agent 0 can take item 3.
- Agent 1 can take item 7.
- Agent 2 can take item 6.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their preferences while all 9 items are allocated.
