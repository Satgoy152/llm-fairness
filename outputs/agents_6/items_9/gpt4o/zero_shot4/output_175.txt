Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  44  99  46  97   9  32  69  82
1  35  70  97  33  51  18  37  24  19
2  78  87  66  24  59  39  87  14  58
3  11  84  77  34  53   1  69  41  59
4  91  47  99  29  56  84   1  64  92
5  81  42   3  63   3  10  28  35  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations of the items by each agent and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, one way to allocate them fairly is to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item, with some receiving more based on their valuations to ensure fairness.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations to ensure they receive at least one of their preferred items.
2. Balance the distribution by considering the remaining items and the agents' next highest preferences.

Following this approach, here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [2] (99 is the highest valuation for agent 0)
- Agent 1 receives items: [1] (70 is the highest valuation for agent 1 after item 2 is taken)
- Agent 2 receives items: [0, 6] (87 is the highest valuation for agent 2, followed by 87 again for item 6)
- Agent 3 receives items: [8] (59 is the highest valuation for agent 3 after other items are allocated)
- Agent 4 receives items: [4, 7] (99 is the highest valuation for agent 4, followed by 64)
- Agent 5 receives items: [3, 5] (63 is the highest valuation for agent 5, followed by 10)

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
