Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  51  54  96  45  41  12  52  47
1   3  78   0  54  63  45  36  26  68
2  92  56  99  37  64  76  27  31  56
3  73  73  71  25  47  81  10  40  81
4  39  42  64  81  63   7  97  91  10
5  14   9  39  70  66  60  76  92  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 78  0 54 63 45 36 26 68]
 [92 56 99 37 64 76 27 31 56]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the "maximum sum of valuations" approach. This method aims to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We'll assign items to agents by selecting the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (92).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (78).
3. Item 2: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (99).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (96).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (64).
6. Item 5: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (81).
7. Item 6: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (97).
8. Item 7: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (92).
9. Item 8: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (81).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2, 4],
    "3": [5, 8],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most.
