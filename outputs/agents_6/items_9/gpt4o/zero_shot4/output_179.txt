Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  67  35  56  62  25  50  61  50
1  49  64  80  22  38  49  77  73  38
2   9  41  15  24  88  82  76  21  21
3  86  47  40  27  90  33  80  29  47
4  50  60  68  66  99  67  64  49  14
5  79  77  30  57  73  31  34  91  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Since there are 6 agents and 9 items, not every agent will receive the same number of items. We can start by allocating items to the agents who have the highest valuations for specific items, and then adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item or to balance the distribution fairly.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high values for items 1 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has high value for item 2.
3. **Agent 2** has high values for item 4.
4. **Agent 3** has high values for item 0.
5. **Agent 4** has high values for item 4.
6. **Agent 5** has high values for item 8.

After allocating items based on the highest value for each item, we will distribute any remaining items to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 5]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [6, 7, 8]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agents receive items that they value highly.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6, 7, 8]
}
```
