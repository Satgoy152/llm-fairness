Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  83  35   1  23  85  56  97   8
1  47  40  77  47  99  91  57  68  44
2  79  24  54  29  75  99   6  15  92
3  73  46  55  62   8  46  42  33   0
4  84  24  88  84   7  63  40  44  54
5  99  45   7  47  39  94  81  36  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. We should aim to distribute the items such that each agent gains value from their allocation. 

Let's examine the valuations and distribute the items:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has for any item and try to allocate that item to them if possible, ensuring no conflicts arise.

2. If there's a conflict (two agents highly value the same item), we will allocate based on the next highest value item for one of the agents.

3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item by the end of the allocation.

Here’s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 7 (value 97).
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 99).
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 5 (value 99).
- Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 73).
- Agent 4: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 88).
- Agent 5: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 99), but since item 0 is assigned, the next highest is item 5 (value 94), but item 5 is assigned, so assign item 6 (value 81).

Continuing to allocate the remaining items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 1 (value 83).
- Agent 1: Allocate item 3 (value 47).
- Agent 4: Allocate item 8 (value 54).

This results in each agent receiving at least one item, and all items being allocated. Here’s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 8],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
