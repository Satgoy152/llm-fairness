Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  95  24  10  17  74  63  14  16
1  61  35  82   1  16  62  65  57  11
2  98  52  39  90  86  13  54  30  12
3  44  24  29  14  12   2  98  99  81
4  37  24  46  31  64  37  41  47  52
5  53  38  63  17   8  16  54  53  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all nine items are allocated in total. The goal is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items they are allocated, while ensuring fairness across the agents. 

Let's proceed with a simple allocation strategy by prioritizing each agent's highest valued items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 1 (95), 0 (78), and 5 (74).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 2 (82), 6 (65), and 5 (62).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 0 (98), 3 (90), and 4 (86).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 7 (99), 6 (98), and 8 (81).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 4 (64), 8 (52), and 2 (46).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest values are for items 2 (63), 8 (60), and 6 (54).

Now, let's allocate items considering the above preferences while ensuring each item is only allocated once:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (95).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 2 (82).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 0 (98).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 7 (99).
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 4 (64).
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 8 (60).

Now, some items are left and need to be allocated to ensure each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

- Remaining items: 3, 5, 6
- Assign item 3 (17) to Agent 5 (next highest available), item 5 (74) to Agent 0, and item 6 (54) to Agent 2.

The allocations are now complete with each agent getting at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8, 3]
}
```
