Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  89  41  47  26  19  27   7  67
1  84  75  68  64  26  27  91  48  42
2  68  57  39  75  64  63  13  56  51
3  11  20  14  11  46  59  69   9  82
4  95  14   9  53  71  99  88  61  61
5  55  46  69  68  55  25   7  52  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each item is only allocated once.

Below is a potential allocation based on the valuations provided:

- **Agent 0**: Allocated items that maximize their values, such as items with valuations 59, 89, and 67.
- **Agent 1**: Allocated items that maximize their values, such as items with valuations 91 and 75.
- **Agent 2**: Allocated items that maximize their values, such as items with valuations 75 and 68.
- **Agent 3**: Allocated items that maximize their values, such as items with valuations 82.
- **Agent 4**: Allocated items that maximize their values, such as items with valuations 99 and 88.
- **Agent 5**: Allocated items based on remaining unallocated items or items that maximize the leftover value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated among the agents in a way that attempts to maximize their overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Note that Agent 5 did not receive any items in this specific allocation.
