Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  33  15   1  59  89  58  80  24
1  62  23  37  53  93  82  62  54  22
2  86  86  78   3  34  21  14  13  24
3  77  82  23  13  18  79  28  70  67
4  38  44  14  80  49  73  33  55  78
5  85  54   9  10  50  23  17  70   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value: 86).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value: 33).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value: 37).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value: 80).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value: 93).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value: 89).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value: 58).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 3 (value: 70).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 4 (value: 78).

Now, let's represent this allocation in the format you requested:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 8],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly, while respecting the constraint that all items are allocated.
