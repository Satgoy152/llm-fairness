Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4   4  67  66  65  90  49  46  80
1  37  37  22   0  57  69  67  35  85
2  80  16  20  17  99  86  20  17  70
3   4  71  79  89  40  74  70  51  90
4  93  21  48  26   9  10  82  92  59
5  42  13  17  71  86  30  50  13  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can try to distribute the items based on their valuations as evenly as possible. The goal is to ensure that each agent's total value from the items they receive is maximized while keeping the distribution fair.

Let's try to allocate the items step by step:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for an item and allocate that item to the respective agent if it has not already been allocated.

2. If conflicts arise (i.e., multiple agents value the same item highly), decide based on which allocation leads to a more balanced overall distribution.

3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Following this approach, here's one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 8 (Values: 67, 80)
- Agent 1: Items 5 and 3 (Values: 69, 0)
- Agent 2: Items 4 and 6 (Values: 99, 20)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (Value: 51)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (Value: 93)
- Agent 5: Item 1 (Value: 13)

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 6 agents as fairly as possible based on the given valuations.
