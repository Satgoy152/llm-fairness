Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  11  73  92  73  70  26  13  30
1   5  10   6  43  30  43  35  80  21
2  71   3  22  67  92   2  18  53  32
3   2  51  56  82  88  80  49   5  50
4  80   3  10  61  27  50  36  56  29
5  54   7  24  55  36   7  55  39  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[40 11 73 92 73 70 26 13 30]
 [ 5 10  6 43 30 43 35 80 21]
 [71  3 22 67 92  2 18 53 32]
 [ 2 51 56 82 88 80 49  5 50]

 [54  7 24 55 36  7 55 39 99]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 6 agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent a single item that they value the most.
2. Check if any agent is left without an item; if so, assign any unallocated item to them.
3. If there are still unallocated items, assign them in a way that increases the total value for the agents.

Let's go through this process:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 92.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most at 80.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 92.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most at 80.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most at 80.
- Agent 5 values item 8 the most at 99.

Currently, all agents have one item, and we have allocated 6 items. We still have 3 items left to allocate (items 1, 2, and 6). We will assign these based on maximizing the total value:

- Item 1 is valued at 51 most by Agent 3.
- Item 2 is valued at 73 most by Agent 0.
- Item 6 is valued at 55 most by Agent 5.

Now, all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [8, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives the maximum value possible based on their preferences.
