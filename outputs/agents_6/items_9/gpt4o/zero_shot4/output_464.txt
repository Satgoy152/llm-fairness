Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  75  84   2  72  37  17  19  39
1  11  34   7  69  78  75  29  80  86
2  47  98  25  40  29  35  65  86  21
3  89  14  78  39  26   6   7  98  51
4  81   8  77  63  33  17  28  49  18
5  42  52   2  40  54  47  17  77  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the valuation table, Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 2. Let's allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: We see Agent 1 values item 8 highly. Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 1 and 7. However, item 1 is already allocated. Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 7, but it's already allocated. Item 3 has a reasonable value and is unallocated, so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 0 highly, but it's allocated. Item 4 is unallocated, so allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 can get item 5, which is unallocated and has a reasonable value.

Now, let's verify the allocation to ensure all items are allocated:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are allocated.
- Item 6 is still unallocated. Agent 3 can also receive item 6 as it has a reasonable value and is unallocated.

Finally, the allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
