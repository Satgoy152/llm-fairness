Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  46  16  86  81  59  64  24  68
1  61  11  39   0  33  66  92  97  24
2  65  52  66  98  22  69  80  17  69
3   6  20  12  92  14  75  63  56  30
4  96  25   5  90  47   0  42  32  51
5  89  13  70  84  48  45  49  22  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations of the items. A simple way to start is by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Identify the agent with the highest valuation for each item.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest value is 96 (Agent 4)
- Item 1: Highest value is 52 (Agent 2)
- Item 2: Highest value is 70 (Agent 5)
- Item 3: Highest value is 98 (Agent 2)
- Item 4: Highest value is 81 (Agent 0)
- Item 5: Highest value is 75 (Agent 3)
- Item 6: Highest value is 92 (Agent 1)
- Item 7: Highest value is 97 (Agent 1)
- Item 8: Highest value is 82 (Agent 5)

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated fairly.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 6, 7
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Items 2, 8

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 8]
}
```
