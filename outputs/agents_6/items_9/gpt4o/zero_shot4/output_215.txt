Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47   2   4  61  23  49   5  80  13
1  10   4  65  50  14  62  58  12  61
2  68  60  81  59  52  25  87  73  72
3  47   6  74  76  10  68  67  61  90
4  44  41  60  71  24  76  30  92  82
5  42  67  18  44  21  38  41  79  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences from the table. This is a type of optimization problem, but for simplicity, let's try to distribute the items ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable value based on their top preferences.

By examining the table, we can see which items are most valued by each agent and try to allocate accordingly:

1. Agent 0's highest value items: 7 (80), 3 (61)
2. Agent 1's highest value items: 2 (65), 5 (62)
3. Agent 2's highest value items: 6 (87), 2 (81)
4. Agent 3's highest value items: 8 (90), 3 (76)
5. Agent 4's highest value items: 7 (92), 5 (76)
6. Agent 5's highest value items: 1 (67), 7 (79)

Let's propose an allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 8
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Item 1

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Considering remaining high value items:
  - Agent 0 can take item 3 (61)
  - Agent 3 can take item 4 (10)
  - Agent 4 can take item 0 (44)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8, 4],
    "4": [5, 0],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent items based on their highest preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
