Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  22  63  72  42  42  36  34  20
1  49  73  99  16  70  37  84  28  63
2  22  19  50  82   8  20  96  49  34
3  31  98  12  12  98  20   2  23  38
4  54  14  10  98  28  38  29  47  32
5  51  30  99  50  42  95  93  28   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent gets a certain number of items based on their highest valuations. Since there are 6 agents and 9 items, some agents will get more items than others. 

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. Each agent should get at least one item. Since there are 9 items, some agents will get an extra item. We will start by giving each agent their highest-valued item.

2. Assign the remaining items to agents based on their next highest valuations.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value is for item 3 (72), so assign item 3.
- Agent 1: Highest value is for item 2 (99), so assign item 2.
- Agent 2: Highest value is for item 6 (96), so assign item 6.
- Agent 3: Highest value is for item 1 (98), so assign item 1.
- Agent 4: Highest value is for item 3 (98), but already taken, second highest is item 0 (54), so assign item 0.
- Agent 5: Highest value is for item 2 (99), but already taken, second highest is item 5 (95), so assign item 5.

We have now allocated 6 items. Let's allocate the remaining 3 items:

- Remaining items: 4, 7, 8.

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 as their next highest preference (70).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 as their next highest preference (49).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3 as their next highest preference (38).

Now, all 9 items are allocated fairly based on the agents' valuations. 

Here is the fair allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
