Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  15  72  73  41  89  15  59  63
1  53   9  94  27  88  63  45  19   6
2  54  53  72  46  73  96  30   9  90
3  15  35  84  11  78  35  69  41  33
4  47   1  68  57  75  25  85  71  43
5  85  95  99  82  37  55  20  30  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's follow a simple greedy algorithm approach where we assign items based on the highest valuation:

1. Find the item with the highest valuation for any agent, allocate that item to the respective agent, and remove that item from further consideration.
2. Repeat step 1 until all items are allocated.

Following this approach:

1. Agent 5 values item 2 at 99 (highest overall), allocate item 2 to agent 5.
2. Agent 2 values item 5 at 96, allocate item 5 to agent 2.
3. Agent 0 values item 5 at 89 (already allocated), next highest is item 3 at 73, allocate item 3 to agent 0.
4. Agent 1 values item 4 at 88, allocate item 4 to agent 1.
5. Agent 3 values item 2 at 84 (already allocated), next highest is item 4 at 78 (already allocated), then item 6 at 69, allocate item 6 to agent 3.
6. Agent 4 values item 6 at 85 (already allocated), next highest is item 4 at 75 (already allocated), then item 8 at 71, allocate item 8 to agent 4.
7. Remaining items are 0, 1, and 7.
8. Agent 5 values item 1 at 95, allocate item 1 to agent 5.
9. Agent 0 values item 0 at 37, allocate item 0 to agent 0.
10. Agent 2 values item 7 at 9, allocate item 7 to agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```
