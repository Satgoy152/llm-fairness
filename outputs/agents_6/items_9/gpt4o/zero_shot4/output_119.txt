Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  95  51  40  88  51  79  61  26
1   9  31  78  84  14   4  89  52  49
2  48  91  23  64  24   6  48  78  65
3  97  74  20   9  20  92  38  21  22
4   3  94  97  71  42  15  27  49   7
5  58  16  48   0  76  37  40  73   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim at maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that every item is assigned to exactly one agent and every agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- Agent 0: [0, 5, 1] (values: 70, 51, 95)
- Agent 1: [3, 6] (values: 84, 89)
- Agent 2: [7] (values: 78)
- Agent 3: [4] (values: 20)
- Agent 4: [2] (values: 97)
- Agent 5: [8] (values: 0)

The allocation ensures that no item is left unallocated, and every agent receives at least one item.

Here is the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [8]
}
```
