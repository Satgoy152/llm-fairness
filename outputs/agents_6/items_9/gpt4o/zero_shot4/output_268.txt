Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  21  54  20  21  65  37  97  57
1  51  57  80  87  44  88  97  51  95
2   7   5   5  62  17   5  24  54  26
3   7  56  38  40  70  10  54  38  31
4  99  86  78  59  84   0  21  74   6
5  17  80  25  14  83  18  75  30  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 21 54 20 21 65 37 97 57]
 [51 57 80 87 44 88 97 51 95]
 [ 7  5  5 62 17  5 24 54 26]

 [99 86 78 59 84  0 21 74  6]
 [17 80 25 14 83 18 75 30 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can use a simple allocation strategy that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent one item that they value the most (or close to the most) among the available items.
2. Ensure that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation step by step:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most at 97. Assign item 7 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most at 97. Assign item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 62. Assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most at 70. Assign item 4 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most at 99. Assign item 0 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 8 the most at 96. Assign item 8 to agent 5.

Now, all agents have at least one item, and we have used 6 items. We need to allocate 3 more items.

Let's allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 5) to the agents such that the total value is maximized:

- Agent 1 also values item 5 highly, at 88. Assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly, at 86. Assign item 1 to agent 4.
- Agent 0 values item 2 highly, at 54. Assign item 2 to agent 0.

Now, all items are allocated. Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 1],
    "5": [8]
}
```
