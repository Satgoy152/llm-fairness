Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  61  83  11  90  57  82  46   7
1  31  24  28   1  79  26   9  47  70
2  31   3  58  88  57  66  84  16  49
3  32  69  88  49   2  61  70  61  14
4  75  54  27  72  32  27  54  76  74
5  59  32  82  17  51  86  64  93  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we should aim to balance the value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We have a total of 9 items to allocate among the 6 agents.

One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Below is one possible allocation that fairly distributes the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2 (values 84 and 83, total 167)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 (value 79)
3. **Agent 2**: Items 3 and 6 (values 88 and 84, total 172)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value 69)
5. **Agent 4**: Items 7 and 8 (values 76 and 74, total 150)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 5 (value 86)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives one or two items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7, 8],
    "5": [5]
}
```
