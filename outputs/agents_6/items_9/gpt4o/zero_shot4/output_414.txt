Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  17  92  83  35  92  69  28  39
1  44  15  16  39  78  46  43  57   4
2   8  87  19  56  93   4  79  62   1
3  87  82  72  18  45  28  54  68  71
4   6  19  27  23  59  86  34  10  48
5  71  94  51  18  57  65  99  63  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 17 92 83 35 92 69 28 39]
 [44 15 16 39 78 46 43 57  4]
 [ 8 87 19 56 93  4 79 62  1]
 [87 82 72 18 45 28 54 68 71]
 [ 6 19 27 23 59 86 34 10 48]
 [71 94 51 18 57 65 99 63 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method like maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 5.
Agent 1 highly values item 4.
Agent 2 highly values item 4.
Agent 3 highly values items 0 and 1.
Agent 4 highly values item 5.
Agent 5 highly values items 1 and 6.
Here's a possible allocation of items:

Agent 0: [2, 5]
Agent 1: [4]
Agent 2: [3]
Agent 3: [0, 7]
Agent 4: [8]
Agent 5: [1, 6]
Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```
