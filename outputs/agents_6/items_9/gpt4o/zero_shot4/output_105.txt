Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35   4   3  71  22  83  44  55  24
1  13  14  52  45  63  55  69  35  55
2  57  45  50  94  28  73  66  10  23
3  87  29  24  44  93  88  48  64  52
4  81  69   4  73  76  64  86  37  28
5   0  35  37  64  66  78   2  19   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their valuations. A simple approach is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has relatively high valuations for items 4 and 6.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest, but it is already taken by Agent 0. They also value item 5.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the highest, but it is already taken. They also value item 0.
5. **Agent 4** values items 0 and 6 the highest.
6. **Agent 5** has moderate valuations but no standout items compared to others.

To ensure fairness, let's assign the items based on the distribution of high valuations and ensure all agents get a chance for fair allocation.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [4, 6]
- **Agent 2**: [8]
- **Agent 3**: [0]
- **Agent 4**: [2]
- **Agent 5**: [1, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and each item is assigned. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 7]
}
```
