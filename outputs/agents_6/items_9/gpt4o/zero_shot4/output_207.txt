Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  61  73   2  53  31  56  39  83
1  31  28   8  64  48  76  78  77  80
2  47  60  43  42  55  94  85  82  81
3  79  77  61  16   9  44  99  34  43
4  63  25  21  63  67  56   8  44   0
5  15  47  88  43  67   6  37  17  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives at least one item, given that there are 9 items and 6 agents. This means some agents will receive more than one item. We will attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for the available items.
2. Assign items to agents based on their highest values, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. Distribute the remaining items by evaluating the next highest values.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value items are 2 (73) and 8 (83). Assign item 8 first (highest value).
- Agent 1: Highest value items are 6 (78) and 8 (80). Assign item 6 (highest remaining value).
- Agent 2: Highest value items are 5 (94) and 6 (85). Assign item 5.
- Agent 3: Highest value items are 6 (99) and 0 (79). Assign item 0.
- Agent 4: Highest value items are 4 (67) and 3 (63). Assign item 4.
- Agent 5: Highest value items are 2 (88) and 8 (88). Assign item 2.

Now, we have assigned 6 items, and each agent has at least one item. We have 3 items left to allocate (items 1, 3, and 7). Let's continue:

- Agent 0's next best item is 1 (61). Assign item 1.
- Agent 1's next best item is 7 (77). Assign item 7.
- Agent 3's next best item is 3 (16). Assign item 3.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
