Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  26  17  73  24   1  47  60   3
1  65  87  82  94  88  36  85  34  64
2  17  98   8  87  40  22  75  95  76
3   3  40  36  86  69  96  80  96  51
4  31  91  70  47   3   1  49   4  35
5  70  83  87  34  13  28  30  21  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (except when not possible due to limited items). This problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm or by considering different allocation strategies to ensure fairness and balance.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item and allocate items with the highest valuation to the corresponding agents.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 94.
2. Agent 2 highly values item 1 with a value of 98.
3. Agent 3 values item 5 the most with a value of 96.
4. Agent 3 also values item 7 with a value of 96.
5. Agent 5 values item 2 with a value of 87.
6. Agent 1 values item 4 with a value of 88.
7. Agent 2 values item 8 with a value of 76.
8. Agent 0 values item 6 with a value of 47.
9. Agent 4 values item 0 with a value of 31.

After this allocation, each item is assigned to an agent, and the distribution aims to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation for each agent.

Here's the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2]
}
```
