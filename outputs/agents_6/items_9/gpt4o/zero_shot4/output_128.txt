Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  73   9  61  22  81  77  15  44
1  60  75  36  92   9  83  58  15  25
2  80  52  34  81  54  77   8  11  11
3  63  47  64  15  23  21  33   6  67
4  68  82  45  55  61  13  99   3  43
5  86   9  64  18  63  30  99  20  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [86  9 64 18 63 30 99 20 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's valuation. We can use a greedy approach here by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Item 0: The highest value is 86 by agent 5.
- Item 1: The highest value is 82 by agent 4.
- Item 2: The highest value is 64 by both agents 3 and 5. Choose agent 5.
- Item 3: The highest value is 92 by agent 1.
- Item 4: The highest value is 63 by agent 5.
- Item 5: The highest value is 83 by agent 1.
- Item 6: The highest value is 99 by both agents 4 and 5. Choose agent 4.
- Item 7: The highest value is 20 by agent 5.
- Item 8: The highest value is 67 by agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": [0, 2, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and the agents receive items based on their highest valuations.
