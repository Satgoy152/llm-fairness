Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  18   2  64  56  71  49  81  76
1  22  33  12  87  61   2  35  60  62
2  15  55  22  83  59  12  77   8   4
3  71  23   8   7  26  46  94  88  54
4  25  19  76  91  81  10  45  61  18
5  57  60  52  78  63  67  98  88  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately an equal sum of valuations for the items they receive. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, most agents will receive 1 or 2 items. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and allocate that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Adjust as necessary to ensure each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 8.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for items 5 and 7.

To ensure fairness in terms of distribution, let's adjust the allocations slightly:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 8
- Agent 2: Items 4
- Agent 3: Items 6
- Agent 4: Items 2, 3
- Agent 5: Items 1, 5, 7

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed.

Here's the resulting JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 3],
    "5": [1, 5, 7]
}
```
