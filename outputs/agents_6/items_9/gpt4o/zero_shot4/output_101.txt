Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  25  61  88  65  77  64  48  74
1  60   5  56  46  66  82  58  10  23
2  18  58  74  91  42  56  99  86   6
3   6  98  31  29  43  31  17  58  40
4  85  59   8  78  55  11  90   1  53
5  15  26  49  34  55  63  38  47  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of items based on their preferences. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items combined.
2. Sort the agents based on their total valuations.
3. Allocate items in a way that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 564
   - Agent 1: 406
   - Agent 2: 530
   - Agent 3: 353
   - Agent 4: 440
   - Agent 5: 425

2. **Sort Agents by Total Valuation (descending order):**
   - Agent 0 (564)
   - Agent 2 (530)
   - Agent 4 (440)
   - Agent 5 (425)
   - Agent 1 (406)
   - Agent 3 (353)

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start with the agent with the highest total valuation and allocate items they value the most, ensuring no overlaps.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items: [3, 8]
- **Agent 1** gets item: [5]
- **Agent 2** gets items: [2, 6]
- **Agent 3** gets item: [1]
- **Agent 4** gets item: [0]
- **Agent 5** gets item: [4, 7]

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item, with the intention of maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations.
