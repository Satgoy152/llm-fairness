Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  13  19  53  21  36  64  75   6
1  54  53  26  95  85  20  29  25  49
2  37  97  20   2  22  55  13  58   9
3  54  40  49  73  69  49  28  51  59
4  49  11  63  56  94  82  43  43  65
5  46  55  19  36  13  49  22  59  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. A reasonable approach is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and then distribute the remaining items to maximize total value.

Here's a possible allocation that strives to balance the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5
- Agent 3: Item 8
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 0

Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
