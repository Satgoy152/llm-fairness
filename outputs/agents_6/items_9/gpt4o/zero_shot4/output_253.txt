Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  34  15   4  62  19  11  87  10
1  57  56  15  48  37  55  63  30  56
2  21  23  87  86  40  59  78  16  96
3  28  81  58  26  86  80  15  26  22
4  52  38  62  77  21  84  78  22  87
5  61  30  15  87  13   0  13  17  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. It's also important to ensure that all items are allocated and no item is left unallocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the item with the highest value for each agent, ensuring no overlap. 
2. Then distribute remaining items to balance the allocations.

Based on the valuations given in the table, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items with high values for them: item 0.
- Agent 1 gets items with high values for them: item 6.
- Agent 2 gets items with high values for them: item 8.
- Agent 3 gets items with high values for them: item 4.
- Agent 4 gets items with high values for them: item 5.
- Agent 5 gets items with high values for them: item 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Allocate item 1 to agent 3 (since agent 3 values it highly compared to others).
- Allocate item 2 to agent 4 (since agent 4 values it significantly).
- Allocate item 7 to agent 0 (since agent 0 values it highly compared to others).

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [4, 1],
    "4": [5, 2],
    "5": [3]
}
```
