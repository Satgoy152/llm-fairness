Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  41  38  64  41  13  86  63  68
1  58  24  27  43  30  30  91  80  97
2   3  69  91  34   7  63   9  73  31
3  98  72  36  24   1  44  39  47  79
4  66  52  33   8  76  81  43  93  19
5  70  49  94  91  17  10  69   8  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the value of the items as evenly as possible across all agents. We need to ensure each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

Let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent and then try to allocate them in a way that balances these values. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value of items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 14 + 41 + 38 + 64 + 41 + 13 + 86 + 63 + 68 = 428
   - Agent 1: 58 + 24 + 27 + 43 + 30 + 30 + 91 + 80 + 97 = 480
   - Agent 2: 3 + 69 + 91 + 34 + 7 + 63 + 9 + 73 + 31 = 380
   - Agent 3: 98 + 72 + 36 + 24 + 1 + 44 + 39 + 47 + 79 = 440
   - Agent 4: 66 + 52 + 33 + 8 + 76 + 81 + 43 + 93 + 19 = 471
   - Agent 5: 70 + 49 + 94 + 91 + 17 + 10 + 69 + 8 + 72 = 480

2. Allocate items to agents, aiming to balance the total values they receive:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 4],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total values across the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
