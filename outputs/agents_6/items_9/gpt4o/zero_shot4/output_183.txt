Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  47  27  15  43  51  86  94  27
1  23  65  31  16   5  17  34  31  30
2  33  19  92  57  69  33  80  61  64
3  56  78  60  53  96  85  74  79  10
4  38  34  78  83   2  68  78  22  77
5  11  45   4  78  36  80  36  93  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's consider the values each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [7, 5] (Values: 94, 51; Total: 145)
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 8] (Values: 65, 16, 30; Total: 111)
- Agent 2: Items [2, 6] (Values: 92, 80; Total: 172)
- Agent 3: Items [4] (Values: 96; Total: 96)
- Agent 4: Items [] (No items; Total: 0)
- Agent 5: Items [0] (Values: 11; Total: 11)

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed and attempts to balance the total value received by each agent.

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This configuration fairly distributes the items while respecting the conditions of the problem.
