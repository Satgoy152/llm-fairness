Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  72  57  74  37  93  92  24  71
1  80  14  62  65   9  68  94  22   2
2   6  54  57  74  12  99  41  71  63
3  72  96  20  66  98  60   1  50  83
4  71  32  56  22  78  67   1  88  53
5  64  84  40  60  90  92  15  33  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is approximately balanced. We can use a greedy algorithm to accomplish this, iteratively assigning each item to the agent who values it the most while considering the current total value each agent has.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Identify the item with the highest value for each agent.
2. Assign that item to the agent with the highest unique valuation among the unallocated items.
3. Repeat until all items are allocated.

Using this approach, let's determine the allocations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (value 94).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (value 94).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (value 99).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (value 98).
- Agent 4 values item 7 the highest (value 88).
- Agent 5 values item 4 the highest but it is already considered; the next highest is item 1 (value 84).

After assigning these items, we'll assign the remaining items based on the next highest values for each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [7]
- Agent 5: [1]

Now, four items remain unallocated (2, 3, 8). Allocate them based on the next highest values:

- Agent 0: Next highest unallocated item is 3 (value 74).
- Agent 1: Next highest unallocated item is 2 (value 62).
- Agent 2: Next highest unallocated item is 8 (value 63).

Now let's present the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
