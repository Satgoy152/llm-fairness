Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  83  16  58  91  55  25  47  15
1  43  45  80  97  99  68  71  37   8
2  74  26  63  35   8  17  21   0  48
3  16  72  98  49   8  60  77  48  99
4  13  97  77  66  62   1  72   6  65
5   6  85  76  64  35  88  71  78  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives. Additionally, we want to ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, and that the allocations are made in a way that respects the total number of items available.

Let's find a reasonable allocation based on the valuations given:

1. Agent 0: Highest valuation for item 4 (91)
2. Agent 1: Highest valuation for item 4 (99)
3. Agent 2: Highest valuation for item 0 (74)
4. Agent 3: Highest valuation for item 8 (99)
5. Agent 4: Highest valuation for item 1 (97)
6. Agent 5: Highest valuation for item 5 (88)

Allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations, ensuring all items are allocated:

- Item 2 (98) to Agent 3
- Item 3 (97) to Agent 1
- Item 6 (72) to Agent 4
- Item 7 (78) to Agent 5

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [8, 2],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": [5, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item.
