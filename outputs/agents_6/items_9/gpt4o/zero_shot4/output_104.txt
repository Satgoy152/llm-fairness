Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  82   3  23  80  99  41  62  44
1  74   2  72  23  71  34  49  86  50
2  52  13  72  76  31  53  97  10   5
3  49  74  18  72   4  71  68  72  70
4  41  85  16  88  20  78  35  67  83
5  14   3  10  99  26   5  54  42  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[15 82  3 23 80 99 41 62 44]
 [74  2 72 23 71 34 49 86 50]
 [52 13 72 76 31 53 97 10  5]

 [41 85 16 88 20 78 35 67 83]
 [14  3 10 99 26  5 54 42 60]]
Output:
To allocate the 9 items to the 6 agents fairly, we will aim to give each agent items in a way that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. Here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign items that maximize their total value.
- Agent 1: Assign items that maximize their total value.
- Agent 2: Assign items that maximize their total value.
- Agent 3: Assign items that maximize their total value.
- Agent 4: Assign items that maximize their total value.
- Agent 5: Assign items that maximize their total value.

Let's go through the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Choose the highest value items for this agent, which are items 5 (99) and 4 (80).
2. **Agent 1**: Choose the highest value items for this agent, which are items 0 (74) and 8 (50).
3. **Agent 2**: Choose the highest value items for this agent, which are items 6 (97) and 3 (76).
4. **Agent 3**: Choose the highest value item for this agent, which is item 1 (74).
5. **Agent 4**: Choose the highest value item for this agent, which is item 3 (88).
6. **Agent 5**: Choose the highest value item for this agent, which is item 3 (99) (already assigned to Agent 0, reassign another high-value item).

Reassign to ensure one item per agent and all are utilized fairly:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [8]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [0, 2, 4, 7]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
