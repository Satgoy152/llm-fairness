Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  82  51  39  75  86  90  60  43
1  83  98  39  87  29  37  81  91  41
2  43  45  47   2  89  25  49  11  62
3  27  40   8  21  42  28  14  67  77
4  91  53  54  20  18  29  34  41  76
5  30  64  16  30  33  37  89  58  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 highly, so let's assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly, so let's assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highly, so let's assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 8 highly, so let's assign item 8 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 highly, so let's assign item 0 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 7 highly, so let's assign item 7 to agent 5.

Now, we have 3 items left (2, 3, 5) and each agent has been assigned at least one item. To distribute the remaining items:

7. Assign item 2 to agent 0, who values it at 51.
8. Assign item 3 to agent 1, who values it at 87.
9. Assign item 5 to agent 2, who values it at 25.

Each agent has at least one item, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7]
}
```
