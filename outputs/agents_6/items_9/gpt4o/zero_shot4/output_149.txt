Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  88  38  52  72  19  65  78  34
1  49  15  71  89  71  97  28  77  20
2  33   1  96   9  30  16  50  81  58
3  42  58  18  28  92  22  12  95  30
4  14  41  77  20  96  96  89  76  46
5  60  58  72  68  18  49  27   2  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable number of items. Since there are 9 items to allocate among 6 agents, some agents will get more items than others. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that tries to balance the total value each agent receives.

Considering the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (value 72) and item 7 (value 78).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (value 97) and item 3 (value 89).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (value 96) and item 7 (value 81).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 7 (value 95) and item 4 (value 92).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 4 (value 96) and item 5 (value 96).
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 0 (value 60) and item 2 (value 72).

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items [4, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Items [5, 3]
- **Agent 2**: Item [2]
- **Agent 3**: Item [6]
- **Agent 4**: Item [8]
- **Agent 5**: Items [0, 1]

This allocation aims to distribute the items based on the highest preferences while ensuring all items are allocated. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```
