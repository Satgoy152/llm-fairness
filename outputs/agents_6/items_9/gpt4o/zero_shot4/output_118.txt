Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  98  31  40  10  22  74  91  96
1  70  39  63  36  84  51  10  24  57
2  11  14  11   7  26  36  37  32  12
3   4  25  13   2  45  23  94  28  33
4  82  18  18  24   4  75  11  74  88
5  59  26   2  48  28  78  47  94  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items based on their valuations. We will try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that all 9 items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's consider a strategy where we allocate items to agents such that each agent gets at least one item they value relatively highly. We'll aim for a balanced distribution across agents to ensure fairness.

Here's a suggested allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 1, 7, 8
   - Item 1: Value 98
   - Item 7: Value 91
   - Item 8: Value 96

2. **Agent 1**: Items 0, 4
   - Item 0: Value 70
   - Item 4: Value 84

3. **Agent 2**: Item 6
   - Item 6: Value 37

4. **Agent 3**: Item 2
   - Item 2: Value 13

5. **Agent 4**: Item 5
   - Item 5: Value 75

6. **Agent 5**: Item 3
   - Item 3: Value 48

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, aiming to provide each agent at least one item they value moderately or highly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and considers their valuations to some extent.
