Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  96  63   0  31  98  32  76  29
1   9  92  75  31   2  32  17  25  33
2  68  62  46  89  89  24  36  56  63
3  32  50  50  44  47  17  87  59   9
4  49  23  42  37  48  55  31  20  34
5  39  51  19  12  46  15  59  15  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction or total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We will try to allocate the items based on the highest value for each agent, ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 98)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (value 92)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (value 89)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (value 87)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (value 48)
- Agent 5: Item 8 (value 78)

This allocation uses 6 items, and now we need to allocate the remaining 3 items.

Let's distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (value 58)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (value 75)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (value 59)

Now, all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed while maximizing the values for each agent.
