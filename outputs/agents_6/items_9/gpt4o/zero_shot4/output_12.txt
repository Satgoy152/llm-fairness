Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  58  83  12  80  72  80  47  80
1  56  19  54  49  14  46   3   7  82
2  37  39  67  32  65  59  13  91  68
3  46  52  27  59  30  83  54   0  89
4  13  61  75  24  59  55  38   7  43
5  40  60  37  60  29  44  55  42  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. We'll use a simple approach where we seek to maximize the total value for each agent while distributing the items evenly.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Item 2 has the highest value (83) for Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Item 8 has the highest value (82) for Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Item 7 has the highest value (91) for Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Item 5 has the highest value (83) for Agent 3.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Item 2 has already been allocated to Agent 0, so consider the next highest value.
   - Item 1 has a value of 61 for Agent 4.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5:** 
   - Item 8 has already been allocated to Agent 1, so consider the next highest value.
   - Item 8 again has the highest value for Agent 5, but since it's taken, we look for the next available.
   - Item 3 has a value of 60.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 5.

Now, allocate the remaining items among the agents:

7. **Remaining items:** 
   - Items 0, 4, and 6 are left.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has a high value for it).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has a high value for it).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 values it relatively high).

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and agents get a fair distribution based on their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```
