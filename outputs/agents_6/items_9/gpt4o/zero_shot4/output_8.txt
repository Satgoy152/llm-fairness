Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  46  20  97  49  27  37  95  31
1  15  24  27  24  19  63  75  69  25
2  73  66  35  85   8  70   7  11  16
3  44  45  77  43  94  97  87  61  39
4  34  62  53   7  53  36  30   3  67
5  85  12  56  19  51  24  77  81  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the total value of items allocated to each agent is roughly balanced. Since there are 6 agents and 9 items, each agent will receive at least one item, and some agents will receive two items.

Let's consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items as fairly as possible based on these valuations. A possible allocation could be:

1. Assign each agent one item with a high value for that agent.
2. Distribute the remaining items to ensure fairness in total valuation.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly (97). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly (75). Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 highly (73). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly (97). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 8 highly (67). Assign item 8 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 7 highly (81). Assign item 7 to Agent 5.

Now, we have assigned 6 items, one to each agent. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (1, 2, and 4) to balance the valuations.

- Agent 0 could be assigned item 1 (value 46 for them).
- Agent 1 could be assigned item 2 (value 27 for them).
- Agent 4 could be assigned item 4 (value 53 for them).

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their highest valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [8, 4],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 9 items allocated in total.
