Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  62   7  88  87  73  12  87  93
1  11  59  35  99  55  86  66  14   3
2  73  32  62  11  59  59  33   6  84
3  67   6  39  13  77  93  14   7   2
4  47  99  41  89   2  56  71  80  33
5  62  40   9   3  66  91   6  92  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 59 35 99 55 86 66 14  3]
 [73 32 62 11 59 59 33  6 84]
 [67  6 39 13 77 93 14  7  2]
 [47 99 41 89  2 56 71 80 33]
 [62 40  9  3 66 91  6 92 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated, we can try to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

One approach to achieve this is to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is as close as possible to others. This is often referred to as the "maximin" strategy, where we maximize the minimum valuation across all agents.

Considering the valuations from the table provided, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4 (Total valuation = 35 + 87 = 122)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3 (Total valuation = 59 + 99 = 158)
- Agent 2: Items 8 (Total valuation = 84)
- Agent 3: Items 5 (Total valuation = 93)
- Agent 4: Items 2, 7 (Total valuation = 41 + 80 = 121)
- Agent 5: Items 6 (Total valuation = 6)

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are distributed.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 7],
    "5": [6]
}
```
