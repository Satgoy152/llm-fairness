Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  17  30  37  97  16  83  47  18
1   8  15  14  89   7  63  28  85  27
2   5  18  27  99  14  31  36  64  18
3  99  47  86  94  50  63   6  38  84
4  74  66  62  89  99  60  27  72  93
5  57  39  24  41  79   7  94  13  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations of the items and ensure that each agent receives a fair share. We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their given valuations.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation per item:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it highest at 99.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it highest at 17.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it highest at 86.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it highest at 99.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it highest at 97.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it highest at 63.
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it highest at 94.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it highest at 85.
- Item 8: Agent 4 values it highest at 93.

Now, let's prepare the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
