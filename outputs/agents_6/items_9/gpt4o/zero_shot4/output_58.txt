Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  36  61  64  27  56  69  12  99
1  50  11   0  85  77  65  28  34   6
2  26   5   3  56  48   7  84  20  32
3  92  52  16  70  64  38  47   6  41
4  76  99  88  53  18  28  33  12  69
5  98  30   9   4  89  37  42  60  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to distribute the items in a way that optimizes the overall satisfaction of the agents. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, each agent might not receive an item, but we can ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible.

Here is a suggested allocation based on the given valuations, attempting to maximize the sum of valuations each agent receives:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 5 (Valuation: 98)
2. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (Valuation: 99)
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (Valuation: 61)
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (Valuation: 85)
5. Assign item 4 to agent 5 (Valuation: 89)
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (Valuation: 56)
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (Valuation: 84)
8. Assign item 7 to agent 5 (Valuation: 60)
9. Assign item 8 to agent 0 (Valuation: 99)

This allocation ensures each agent gets the items that they value the most, optimizing the overall happiness:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 4, 7]
}
```
