Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  92  14  48   0  28  55   8  71
1  49  26  52  72  52  97  89  28  21
2  13  48  24  32   4  81   6  90  71
3  21  24   1  46  89   3  95  39  79
4  91  23  20  83  64  19  33  91  49
5  85  51  34   4  87  33  77  40  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 6 agents, we need to consider the preferences (valuations) of each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest valuations first. Let's do that:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Repeat until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value is 91 (Agent 4)
- Item 1: Highest value is 92 (Agent 0)
- Item 2: Highest value is 52 (Agent 1)
- Item 3: Highest value is 83 (Agent 4)
- Item 4: Highest value is 89 (Agent 3)
- Item 5: Highest value is 97 (Agent 1)
- Item 6: Highest value is 95 (Agent 3)
- Item 7: Highest value is 91 (Agent 4)
- Item 8: Highest value is 79 (Agent 3)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets assigned an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [4, 6, 8]
- Agent 4: [0, 3, 7]
- Agent 5: []

All 9 items are allocated, with each agent getting an integer number of items. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 6, 8],
    "4": [0, 3, 7],
    "5": []
}
```
