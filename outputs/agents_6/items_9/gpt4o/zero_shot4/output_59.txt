Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  41  74  25  92  13  53  15  76
1  86  32  40  56  54  22  19  28  82
2  50   7   6   2   0  70  62  48  60
3  88  96  94  10  10  80  45  58  65
4  98  31  67  96  95   3  22  82  32
5  55  45  47  69  38  36  86   6  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent has a balanced share in terms of their valuations. A common approach is to attempt a max-min allocation or use a method like the envy-free allocation, but given the context, we'll focus on balancing total value for each agent as much as possible, assuming each agent values the items according to the table provided.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all the items.
2. Try to distribute the items such that the sum of the values assigned to each agent is as balanced as possible.

Letâ€™s calculate the total valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

Total valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: 452
- Agent 1: 419
- Agent 2: 305
- Agent 3: 546
- Agent 4: 426
- Agent 5: 407

Now, allocate the items:

- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2. Allocate these to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 3, 4, 7. Allocate these to Agent 4.
- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 8. Allocate this to Agent 0.
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 6. Allocate this to Agent 5.
- Agent 1 has a reasonably good valuation for item 5. Allocate this to Agent 1.

Now, each agent should have a reasonable share based on their preferences, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1, 2],
    "4": [3, 4, 7],
    "5": [6]
}
```
