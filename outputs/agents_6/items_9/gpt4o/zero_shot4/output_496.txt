Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  82  56  53  11  43  30  70  78
1  32  94  43  94  47  76  84  86  28
2  35  90   7   3  73  49  34  63  32
3  90  21  87  68  47  23   0  63  73
4   6  76  13  63  37  17  15  78  45
5  14  27  74  56  29  28  75  37  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes the total valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given that there are 6 agents and 9 items, one approach is to ensure that three agents receive two items each while the remaining three agents receive one item each. Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Focus on the highest valuations for each agent and try to allocate items that maximize satisfaction.

2. **Allocate Items to Agents:**
   - Agent 0: Valuations are highest for items 0, 1, and 8.
   - Agent 1: Valuations are highest for items 1, 3, and 7.
   - Agent 2: Valuations are highest for items 1, 4, and 7.
   - Agent 3: Valuations are highest for items 0, 2, and 8.
   - Agent 4: Valuations are highest for items 1, 3, and 7.
   - Agent 5: Valuations are highest for items 2, 6, and 8.

3. **Allocate Based on Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 8] (95 + 78)
   - Agent 1: [3, 7] (94 + 86)
   - Agent 2: [4] (73)
   - Agent 3: [2] (87)
   - Agent 4: [1, 5] (76 + 17)
   - Agent 5: [6] (75)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 8]
   - Agent 1: [3, 7]
   - Agent 2: [4]
   - Agent 3: [2]
   - Agent 4: [1, 5]
   - Agent 5: [6]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 5],
    "5": [6]
}
```
