Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16   9  86   4   9  39  55  51  49
1  84  65  79  61  51  73  61  96  28
2  89  11  84   1  19   3  24  10  22
3  85  30  16  99  41  37  82  92  89
4  54   5  96  20   5  80  84  12  68
5  80   0  55  59  99  57   1  75  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0's highest valuations are for items 2, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1's highest valuations are for items 0, 7, and 5.
- Agent 2's highest valuations are for items 0, 2, and 6.
- Agent 3's highest valuations are for items 3, 7, and 8.
- Agent 4's highest valuations are for items 2, 5, and 6.
- Agent 5's highest valuations are for items 4 and 5.

Let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent.

Possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 6]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3, 8]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [1, 4]

This allocation uses all 9 items and considers the agents' preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```
