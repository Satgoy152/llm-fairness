Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  34  73  62  96  22  37  96  14
1  66  48  68  12  75  88  36  28  92
2  67  38  66  38  29   8  90  28  82
3  45  66  93  52  12  27   7   9  99
4  21  97  24   2   5  60  92  83   4
5  21  15  73  38   2  81  68  78  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 48 68 12 75 88 36 28 92]
 [67 38 66 38 29  8 90 28 82]

 [21 15 73 38  2 81 68 78 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent by assigning them items they value highly, while also ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [92, 34, 73, 62, 96, 22, 37, 96, 14]
Agent 1: [66, 48, 68, 12, 75, 88, 36, 28, 92]
Agent 2: [67, 38, 66, 38, 29, 8, 90, 28, 82]
Agent 3: [45, 66, 93, 52, 12, 27, 7, 9, 99]
Agent 4: [21, 97, 24, 2, 5, 60, 92, 83, 4]
Agent 5: [21, 15, 73, 38, 2, 81, 68, 78, 92]
```

Let's allocate items such that the distribution is as fair as possible:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 96).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 88).
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 90).
4. Assign item 8 to Agent 3 (value 99).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (value 97).
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 5 (value 38).

Now, distribute the remaining items (0, 2, 7):

7. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 92).
8. Assign item 2 to Agent 5 (value 73).
9. Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (value 83).

Now, let's finalize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while distributing all 9 items.
